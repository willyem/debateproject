John Donvan: 
I want to bring to the stage -- what we like to do is just take a little bit of a moment to 
frame this debate and the question of why we're doing this debate and its relevance. 
 And to do that, we always bring to the stage at this point Robert Rosenkranz, who is the 
chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S. and I'd like to bring him out now. 
 
[applause] 
 
18:50:01 
 
So, Robert, why this debate?  Why does this one intrigue you, in particular?  Because I 
know it does. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
I kind of got interested in this topic by reading a book about science.  It was by the 
astronomer royal of England, a man called Martin Rees, and the book was called "Just 
Six Numbers."  And it was about six physical constants that were imprinted in the early 
universe, in the first 100 millionth of a second after the Big Bang.  And these constants 
express ideas like the strength of gravity, the strength of the bond that keeps the 
nucleus of atoms together, the uniformity of that initial fireball.  And if any of those six 
numbers was much larger or much smaller, we would really not have a universe; either 
stars and galaxies wouldn't have formed, or there'd be no elements as complicated as

carbon and oxygen, or the Big Bang would've been succeeded by a big crunch into a 
black hole in which all matter would've disappeared. 
 
18:51:12 
 
And when you think about this, or at least for me, I thought, could this be just chance or 
is there some uncanny intelligence at work in this early design? 
 
John Donvan: 
And for the -- what we're doing here tonight, why is this not -- you know, this has been 
going on for a long time, this conversation, why is this not just the Scopes Monkey trial 
all over again? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, because I think this conversation should be much more sophisticated than when 
dealing with the literal truth of something in the Old Testament.  And, in addition, of 
course, science has moved on so much since that time.  So I think this is going to be a 
very -- a much more subtle and interesting debate than that one might have been. 
 
18:51:55 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm sure it's going to be, because we're going to bring out our debaters so that you can 
meet them, and we'll let the debate get started.  Thanks very much.  Robert Rosenkranz.

I just want to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for making this 
possible.

18:52:59 
 
Isaac Newton invented calculus, and he believed in God; Max Planck was the father of 
quantum physics, also a believer; Copernicus, the solar system, he had the faith; and 
Galileo and Francis Bacon and Pascal, they all believed.  What they also all had in 
common is that none of them was born within 150 years of us.  Today, three out of 
every five scientists, knowing what they know, said that they can't really buy into the 
concept of God.  Science refutes God, they would say.  Really?  So then what about the 
two out of five scientists who do believe in God and they actually know the same stuff? 
 It sounds like the makings of a great debate, so let's get on to it. 
 
Yes or no to this statement: science refutes God.  A debate from Intelligence Squared 
U.S.  I'm John Donvan, we have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing for 
and against that motion, "science refutes God."  Our debate goes in three rounds, and 
then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only side wins. 
 
18:54:03 
 
On the side arguing for the motion "science refutes God," Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical 
physicist and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University.  His partner is 
Michael Shermer; he is a founding publisher of Skeptic Magazine, and a columnist for 
Scientific America.  On the side arguing against the motion that science refutes God, 
Dinesh DSouza; he is the bestselling author of "What's So Great About Christianity?” 
and director of the documentary, "2016: Obama's America." 
 
[applause] 
 
And his partner is Ian Hutchinson.  Ian Hutchinson is the professor of nuclear science 
and engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 
18:54:59 
 
[applause] 
 
Let's meet our debaters.  Our motion is, "Science Refutes God."  And welcome first to 
argue in support of the motion, Lawrence Krauss.

Oh, that was confusing. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
I'm eager. 
 
John Donvan: 
You are eager.  So, Lawrence, I first want to chat with you just -- just a moment.  So I 
want to tell folks, you are a theoretical physicist.  Your research interests have included 
partial physics, dark matter, neutrino astrophysics, which is kind of easy stuff for all of 
us.  You also -- you like to push buttons, and you wrote "Forget Jesus: The Stars Died So 
That You Could Be Here Today," which doesn't sound very polite. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Do you think that's provocative? 
 
John Donvan: 
Slightly, yeah. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Well, I think provoking people and ridicule and satire is incredibly important in the world 
today.  Nothing should be above ridicule because it gets people to think and least of all, 
religion. 
 
18:56:06 
 
John Donvan: 
And your partner is? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Michael Shermer. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Shermer. 
 
[applause] 
 
Michael, you are the founder of Skeptic magazine and the Skeptics Society.  You were 
not always skeptical on this issue.  You, as a teenager, were a born-again Christian, and 
then you switched to the other team.  You're what my eighth grade nun would call "a 
very brazen and naughty boy." 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Well, I'd be happy to talk to her about it for you if you like, but --

John Donvan: 
She passed on, which I think would go to the other side. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Well, I was a born-again Evangelical.  I went knocking on doors to doors to tell people 
about Jesus.  And then later when I became a born-again atheist, I went back to those 
same houses and knocked on their doors… I was wrong. 
 
18:56:57 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Our motion is "Science Refutes God."  We have two debaters arguing against 
this motion.  I'd like to introduce the first, ladies and gentlemen, Dinesh DSouza. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Dinesh, you're a best-selling author and the director of "2016: Obama's America," the 
second highest grossing political documentary of all time.  You have debated this issue a 
number of times.  You've been on stages arguing against atheists a lot.  And a lot of 
times they say that science refutes god, but you came out with a book called "God 
Forsaken."  And the way you turn this argument on its head, how? 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Well, I think science is a -- can be a tool to help us understand God.  And so far from 
science refuting God, I see science as a wonderful instrument for helping us learn about 
the world and thus learning about its creator. 
 
John Donvan: 
And your partner is? 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
My partner is Ian Hutchinson. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Ian Hutchinson. 
 
[applause] 
 
18:57:55 
 
Ian, Ian Hutchinson, you are a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT.  Your 
contributions to science include, and I take this from your biography online at MIT, they 
include, "The First Observations of Polarized Tokamak Electron, Cyclotron Radiation and

Development of Diagnostics and Thermal and Nonthermal Electronic Distributions Based 
On It."  So you're that guy? 
 
[laughter] 
 
What are you doing here? 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Well, I guess that is the question, isn't it? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
But most seriously, I am a scientist, and I'm also a Christian.  I think both are very 
important parts of the way that we understand the world.  And I think that's why this 
debate is so important. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, our live audience, act as our judges.  We ask you before 
the debate has ended to vote twice, once before you've heard the arguments and once 
again after you've heard the arguments.  And the team whose numbers have moved by 
the highest percentage will be declared our winner.  So we would like to register the 
preliminary vote.  If you go to the key pads at your seat, set of numbers one through 
three, and if you agree with the motion at this point, Science Refutes God, we want you 
to push number one. 
 
18:59:11 
 
If you disagree, push number two.  And if you are undecided or agnostic, push number 
three.  And if you feel that you've pushed a number in error, just correct it, and the 
system will lock in your last vote.  And we're going to hold the result of this first vote 
until the end of the debate.  When you vote the second time, we'll compare the two 
numbers.  And again the team whose numbers have moved by the highest percentage 
will be declared our winner. 
 
All right.  So on to round one, opening statements from each debater in turn.  Our 
motion is "Science Refutes God."  And here to debate first in support of this motion, 
Lawrence Krauss.  He is the director of the Origins Project and professor of physics at 
the school of earth and space exploration at Arizona State University.  He is an -- also an 
author of the best-selling book, a -- let me do that again so that it's clean for the radio 
broadcast because I really want to help you sell this book.

Lawrence Krauss: 
Yeah, you bet.  You can take all the time you want. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
He is also the author of the best-selling book, "A Universe From Nothing."  Ladies and 
gentlemen, Lawrence Krauss. 
 
[applause] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Thank you.  I actually wore this t-shirt for the subject of the debate.  And it's the center 
of the debate.  And it's clear.  The motion is science refutes God.  And Michael and I 
have the distinct advantage here of arguing in favor of the motion because in fact we 
have evidence, reason, logic, rationality, and empirical methods on our side, whereas 
the opponents have vague hopes and fears, and they're arguing in favor of a motion 
that's hanging on for its existence by mere shreds of emotional and ideological 
spaghetti, much like this type provided by the flying spaghetti monster, one of the 
equally irrational gods which science provides no support for. 
 
19:01:09 
 
But I first want to begin by clarifying the nature of the motion, because the motion isn't 
science disproves God.  It's science Refutes God.  And that's very important because you 
can't disprove a notion that's basically vague and unfalsifiable.  I could not -- there's no 
way to disprove the notion that God didn't create all of us 15 seconds ago with the 
memories of the amusing comments we heard before that.  There's no way we can 
disprove that, okay.  And that's really important to recognize that those kind of 
unfalsifiable notions are unfalsifiable, as I say.  But we can ask, is it rational to expect 
that that's likely.  And tonight I want to emphasize that 500 years of science have 
demonstrated that God, that vague notion, is not likely.  It's irrational to believe in God. 
 
19:01:59 
 
Now, to refute God means refuting several claims.  Onethat are all based on faith, not 
evidence.  One, that God is necessary, two, that there is evidence for God; and three, 
that that belief is rational.  And the point is that the progress of science has shown over 
and over and over again that the answers to all those three questions are no.  No, no, 
no.  Now, my own scientific field is cosmology.  And that's the study of the origin and 
evolution of the universe as a whole.  And it's where science and religion sort of 
confront each other.  And creation myths have abounded throughout human history, 
and science confronts those creation myths.  And we'll talk about that, I'm sure, at some 
point in the debate.  But I want to point out that our opponents, I'm pretty sure, are 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

going to argue first that one aspect of science that supports perhaps the belief in God is 
this notion that the universe is apparently fine-tuned for life.  I hear that a lot, and 
because it was fine-tuned so life could exist.  That is a remarkable and, in fact, cosmic 
misunderstanding, because it's the same kind of misunderstanding that led people to 
believe in special creation for life on earth before Darwin. 
 
19:03:07 
 
It looked like everything was designed for the environment in which it lived.  But what 
Darwin showed us was that a simple proposition, namely that there's genetic variation 
among a population combined with natural selection meant that you didn't need 
supernatural shenanigans, that in fact all the diversity of life on earth could arise from a 
single life form, by natural law.  And he didn't know -- what he showed was it was 
plausible, based on the evidence -- he didn't know about DNA.  He didn't know about 
the details of genetic replication, but he showed it was plausible.  And as I'll say, that's 
where we're at now as far as the understanding of the universe is concerned.  Now, our 
-- my opponents, I suspect, will argue the universe is equally fine-tuned for life, and they 
-- in fact, they will point out that certain fundamental parameters in nature, if they were 
different, we couldn't exist. 
 
19:03:58 
 
Or they may boldly assert that, in fact, certain of these parameters are so strange and 
unnatural that they must have been established with malice aforethought to ensure our 
existence.  This too is an illusion.  Just as bees need to see the color of flowers but 
they're not designed to do it, if they couldn't see them, they couldn't get the nectar and 
reproduce.  So what we're seeing is a version of cosmic natural selection.  We would be 
quite surprised to find ourselves living in a universe in which we couldn't live.  In fact, 
that might be evidence for God. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But I want to point out that in fact the universe isn't particularly fine-tuned or conducive 
to life.  Most of the universe is rather inhospitable to life.  And in fact -- perhaps the 
biggest fine-tuning problem in my own field of cosmology, something I'm, in fact, very 
proud to have proposed in a sense is that the energy of empty space is not zero.  The 
weirdest thing you can imagine, that empty space weighs something, but remarkably 
the energy of empty space is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than we would naïvely 
predict. 
 
19:05:02 
 
And if it were much bigger than we measure, it's true that galaxies couldn't form, and 
planets couldn't form, and Intelligence Squared Debates couldn't happen.  So the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

universe appears to be here because Intelligence Squared is here.  Now, that suggests 
religion perhaps, but the point is not that that claim of fine tuning is ridiculous because, 
in fact, if the energy of empty space was zero, which is a -- by far a more natural value, 
the universe would be a better place for life to live in.  We all thought it was zero when I 
was a graduate student, because that was a natural value.  If it was zero, the universe 
would be a better place.  In fact, you can show the value that it has now makes the 
universe the worst of all possible universes to live in for the future of life.  So, so much 
for a universe created for us.  
 
[laughter] 
 
Now, once Darwin had removed the apparent need for God in evolution of life, the last 
bastion for God was the creation of the universe, how you can get something from 
nothing.  And what -- we're in a remarkable situation of being in is precisely the same 
situation that Darwin existed in 150 years ago, namely, we have a plausible explanation 
of how a universe could precisely come from nothing. 
 
19:06:13 
 
If you asked, "What would be the characteristics of the universe that came from nothing 
by natural laws?" it would be precisely the characteristics of the universe we observe, 
and it didn't have to be that way.  It could have been another way.  And by nothing -- 
and it -- the -- my opponents will say that by nothing, I'm not talking about nothing, but 
I'm talking about nothing, no particles, no radiation, no space, no time, and even no 
laws of physics.  Our -- [unintelligible] my opponents might argue that the multiverse, 
which our universe might have spontaneously been created in, was created by physicists 
because they don't like God, because it's eternal and exists outside our universe, those 
same characteristics that God is supposed to have.  But it wasn't created because we 
don't like God, although I don't like God.  It was -- we'd been driven to it by 
measurements.  In fact, I don't even like the multiverse, but I've learned to force my 
beliefs to conform to the evidence of reality. 
 
19:07:00 
 
That's where science differs from religion.  There do remain deep philosophical and 
seismic questions that are unanswered, but God is not required or useful to explain any 
of them.  And, therefore, to conclude, science has taught us that we don't need God to 
create a universe, that there's no evidence for God, that the specific sides of the claims 
of those who require God disagree with empirical evidence, and it's irrational.  Science 
refutes God, so clearly you should vote for our side.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Lawrence Krauss.

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[applause] 
 
And that is our motion, "Science refutes God."  And here to speak against the motion, 
Ian Hutchinson.  He is a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT and the 
author of "Monopolizing Knowledge: The Scientist Refutes Religion Denying Reason 
Destroying Scientism." 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Thank you for the opportunity to be with you tonight and to explain why science does 
not refute God.  Let's agree that this motion is not about whether, for example, the 
latest sociological theories disprove the gods and goddesses of ancient Greek 
mythology. 
 
19:08:06 
 
No, it's about whether modern natural science exemplified by things like physics, 
chemistry, biology, geology, and so on rule out thoughtful theism.  The god I'm going to 
discuss is the God of Christianity, because I'm a follower of Jesus, but my side's job is not 
to convince you of the truth of Christianity, although I think it is true.  Our job is just to 
show that Christianity's God is not refuted by science.  Now, obviously there are some 
religious beliefs that are ruled out by science, for example, the belief that the earth is 
stationary and orbited by the sun, moon, and stars.  That is disproved by science, and 
perhaps prior to the 17th century, most Christians held a belief like that, as did most 
other people.  But that stationary earth belief is not in the least central to the Christian 
message and doctrine. 
 
19:09:06 
 
To establish the motion, what our opponents have to do is to show that some central 
tenet of what Christians believe about God is impossible or at least highly implausible in 
the light of science, and that's a tall order.  Actually, they can't even come close.  But let 
me dispense with a couple of the most plausible sounding arguments.  I'll illustrate one 
common argument from the writing of an MIT colleague, Alan Lightman, who wrote in 
the Salon magazine last year, he said, "The central doctrine of science is the view that 
the laws of nature are inviolable."  He said, "Science and God are compatible as long as 
the latter, God, is content to stand on the sidelines once the universe has begun." 
 
19:10:00 
 
Now, I certainly shall not shrink the God that I advocate down into a deistic, non-
interventionist first cause.  No, the God I'm interested in is personal and active in the 
world.  So the question is, "How do I answer Alan Lightman?"   It's straight forward.  The 
presumption that the laws of nature are inviolable is just not a doctrine of science.  Alan 
and a lot of other people are just wrong about that.  Science's method and its program 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

is to describe the universe insofar as it is repeatable and follows universal laws, but 
science hasn't got the slightest need to extrapolate that method and program into a 
presumption that everything that happens must be so describable.  And the majority of 
the scientific heroes of history did not make that presumption. 
 
19:11:02 
 
Great scientists like those that were recited before, Newton, Boyle, Dalton, Faraday, 
Maxwell, were Christian believers who saw their science as compatible with a God who 
is active in the world and, on occasion, works miracles that go beyond the laws that they 
were discovering.  So the notion that for science to function, or in order to be a 
successful scientist, it is necessary to believe in universal laws, is indisputably disproved 
by history.  A second frequent critique of belief in God is that it is based on irrational 
faith rather than evidence.  And this, of course, is a fallacy.  Belief in God is often highly 
rational.  The universities that were established between, say, the 14th and the 18th 
centuries, were places of explicitly religious rationality and learning. 
 
19:12:04 
 
Actually, evidence is just one type of reason for belief in God, and there is a loss of 
evidence for Christianity.  But what the critics mean, I think, is -- they're saying there's 
no scientific evidence for God.  And that goes to the heart of this question and the myth 
that science has somehow refuted God.  Actually, there are some things we've learned 
about the universe through science that are highly suggestive of a creator, but for the 
sake of argument, suppose that the scientific evidence for God were non-existent. 
 Would that mean that science refutes God, or would it even mean and support the 
more modest claim that there's no evidence for God?  Not at all. 
 
19:12:58 
 
God is mostly not a scientific question, and so the evidence for God is mostly not 
scientific.  If you insist that scientific evidence is the only type you will count, then you 
put out of business not just religion, but a vast range of other human knowledge, like 
history, or the law, or politics, or philosophy, or literature.  There's no scientific way to 
prove that Caesar crossed the Rubicon; there's no scientific way to judge the justice of a 
verdict; there isn't even a scientific way to detect a true thought.  But all of these things 
are real cognitive questions whose answers are important and often indisputable.  And 
questions about God are usually of the same type, not scientific. 
 
19:13:58 
 
About 50 years ago, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space.  Soviet President 
Nikita Khrushchev told the Communist Party, anti-religionist, "Gagarin flew into space 
but he didn't find any God there."  Well, what a silly argument.  But most of the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

arguments behind the view that science has refuted God are of much the same type.  If 
science, in its endeavors, fails to detect God, so what?  Thoughtful Christians don't 
believe that God is a natural phenomenon or a law of nature to be established by 
scientific investigation.  Science, for all of its power, is utterly incompetent to refute 
God. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Ian Hutchinson. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:14:57 
 
And a reminder of what's going on.  We are halfway through the opening round of this 
Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four debaters, two teams 
of two arguing it out over this motion:  "Science Refutes God."  You have heard two of 
the speakers so far, and now onto the third.  "Science Refutes God."  And here to speak 
in support of the motion, Michael Shermer.  He is the founding publisher of Skeptic 
magazine, executive director of the Skeptics Society, a monthly columnist for Scientific 
American and the author of "The Believing Brain."  Ladies and gentlemen, Michael 
Shermer. 
 
[applause] 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm going to start off with a thought experiment.  Imagine you're 
a hominid on the plains of Africa 3.5 million years ago.  You're a tiny little 
Australopithecus afarensis, little brain.  Your name is Lucy.  Thank you.  A lot of people in 
the Midwest don't get that. 
 
[laughter] 
 
19:16:00 
 
Evolution, what?  Not that Lucy, the other one.  And you hear a rustle in the grass.  Is it a 
dangerous predator, or is it just the wind?  If you think that the rustle in the grass is a 
dangerous predator, and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made a type one error in 
cognition.  A false positive.  You thought the wind was connected to something, and it 
wasn't.  A was connected to B, and it wasn't.  So that's a false positive.  But that's 
relatively harmless.  But if you think that the rustle in the grass is just the wind, and it 
turns out it's a dangerous predator, you're lunch.  Congratulations.  You've just been 
given a Darwin award for taking yourself out of the gene pool early before reproducing. 
 And we are the descendants of those who are most likely to make type one errors, 
false-positives, versus type two errors, false-negatives.  That is to say, why can't you just

stay in the grass and collect enough data to get the answer right?  And the answer is 
that predators don't wait around for prey animals to collect more data.  That's why they 
stalk and sneak up on their prey animals, so they can't get enough data. 
 
19:17:06 
 
So we evolve the propensity to make snap decisions and make one kind of error more 
likely than another kind of error.  And that kind of error, that false positive, that's 
superstition.  That's magical thinking.  That's assuming A is connected to B.  It's a true 
pattern, and it isn't, and you're wrong.  That's the basis of finding false patterns like 
gods.  Now, what's the difference between the wind and a dangerous predator?  The 
wind is an inanimate force.  A dangerous predator is an intentional agent.  And his 
intention is to eat me, and that can't be good.  So what we also do in addition to finding 
these meaningful patterns is infuse in them agency.  That is, it's alive.  It's real, it has 
intention, and its intention is not good, so I better assume it's real.  And this is the basis 
of animism and spiritism and polytheism and monotheism and the belief in angels and 
aliens and demons and spirits and poltergeists and gods. 
 
19:18:12 
 
Gods are invisible agents who run the world, who control things, who create these 
patterns, who are these patterns that we use to explain things.  All cultures everywhere 
in the world have created god beliefs.  Gods with these intentional -- that are intentional 
agents.  So my question tonight is not like in my book, why do so many people believe in 
God, here is a theory, which I just outlined for you. 
 
But for tonight, I want to ask, what's more likely, that our opponents here happen to 
pick the right God and the right religion among all the -- about 10,000 different religions 
and about a thousand different gods the humans have constructed socially, 
anthropologically, psychologically in the last 10,000 years.  10,000 different religions, a 
thousand different gods. 
 
19:19:03 
 
Our opponents agree with us that 999 of those gods are false gods.  They are atheists 
like we are atheists.  What I'm asking you to do is just go one God further with us. 
 
[laughter] 
 
So here's what happened.  About 5,000 to 7,000 years ago, these small bands of hunter-
gathers began to coalesce into chiefdoms and states.  As long as the numbers are small, 
informal means of behavior control and moral enforcement operate quite well.  As soon 
as the numbers are too large for these informal means, shunning, making people feel 
guilty, gossiping about them, making them feel embarrassed for their bad behavior, as

soon as the population are big, there's too much opportunity for free riding and for 
cheating the system and taking advantage of it and getting away with it. 
 
19:20:00 
 
So two institutions evolved, government to set up a set of rules, and everybody gets a 
copy; and religion in case you think you got away with it, you didn't because there's an 
eye in the sky that those all and sees all and keeps track of this.  So this is the second 
part of how humans construct religions and gods, because we need it for moral 
enforcement.  It just so happens, by contingency and chance, religion and government 
was the first on the scene. 
 
Now, what's happened in the last several centuries, since the enlightenment, in addition 
to the trajectory that professor Krauss outlined for you, science displacing religion as the 
primary means of explaining how the world works, something else has also happened.  
We've slowly but ineluctably replaced religion as the primary source of our morals and 
came up with the clever idea that you actually have to have a reason why you have 
certain moral principles, and we're going to write certain laws.  You actually have to give 
evidence for why you think this is a good law or a bad law or a good moral principle or a 
bad moral principle. 
 
19:21:02 
 
And that has been the trajectory of the enlightenment since about 200 years ago.  And 
so again, what's more likely, that one of them happens to be the one true religion, and 
the one true God, and all those others that have been constructed are false gods or 
that, as we can clearly see, anthropologically, socially, psychologically and so on, this is 
what people do to get along.  They construct religions.  They construct moral systems 
and so on.  We now know that we can do this without gods.  In fact, we do it quite well 
without gods.  Northern European countries do just fine with much lower rates of 
religiosity than we have.  It is possible to do it, and that is what we've been doing. 
 
19:21:46 
 
Now, I want to finish with just one comment on the resurrection since Ian brought that 
up.  Let me just -- leaving aside the scientific evidence for this, just think about what it is 
that is being said here.  They are monotheists.  They believe that there's just one God 
and that Jesus is God manifest on earth.  And he is your savior, and you accept him for 
redeeming us for sins we never committed.  Somebody else in the past committed 
them.  So as I understand this, God sacrifices himself to himself to save us from himself. 
 If that sounds as incomprehensible to you as it does to me, I urge to you vote for our 
side.  Thank you.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Michael Shermer.  And our motion is "Science Refutes God."  And now our 
final debater speaking against this motion, Dinesh DSouza.  He is the best-selling of 
many books including, "What's So Great About Christianity."  He's also the director of 
the documentary "2016: Obama's America."  And a former policy analyst in the Reagan 
White House.  Ladies and gentlemen, Dinesh DSouza. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:23:07 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Thank you very much.  How would one go about refuting the idea -- establishing the 
idea that science refutes God?  First of all, you'd have to show that belief in God was, if 
not impossible, unreasonable.  And, therefore, you'd have to show that all the people in 
the world who believe in God are also being unreasonable and that science has 
established this not at some point in the future, but has established it already.  Science 
has refuted God right now.  Now, on the face of it, this is such an odd and difficult and 
preposterous enterprise.  Why?  Because actually the questions to which God is the 
answer are really fundamentally not scientific questions. 
 
19:24:00 
 
Here is what I mean.  Here we are as human beings.  We're thrown into the world.  And 
we can't help if we're curious, if we're thoughtful to say, first of all, why is there a 
universe?  Second, what's our purpose?  What are we doing here?  Third, what's going 
to come after?  We're going to die, but what next?  Now I ask you, what are the 
scientific answers to those questions?  And in fact, the answers are, from science, don't 
have a clue, don't have a clue, and don't have a clue.  Why?  Because none of those 
questions is amenable to being decided empirically.  Science can show how we got a 
universe but not why.  On the question of what our purpose is here, science is 
completely silent.  Moral issues are in a way outside the province of science.  Why? 
 Because science deals with what is, and morality is what ought to be. 
 
19:25:04 
 
And finally, under the question of what comes after death, what possible empirical 
evidence can science provide on either side of that question?  So because science is in 
no position to refute God, what we get from the other side is pop psychology.  And 
we've been getting pop psychology from atheists for several hundred years.  It's an 
effort to explain why people believe instead of providing any kind of a real refutation. 
 You remember a few decades ago Freud basically said that God and religion could be 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

dismissed as wishful thinking, "We wish for a better world and so we make one up."  
Well, that would kind of explain Heaven which satisfies wishful thinking, but it really 
wouldn't explain why major religions have invented Hell.  Who would wish for that?  
Hell is a lot worse than diabetes or the suffering we have in this life. 
 
19:25:59 
 
And then you've heard here people like Richard Dawkins say, "Well, belief in God 
depends on where you're born.  If you're born in Afghanistan you're going to be a 
Muslim.  If you're born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you're likely to be a Christian."  Michael 
Shermer alluded to that a little bit when he talked about multiple gods.  But the 
sociology of the origin of belief says nothing about the truth of a belief.  I'm sure that 
people who are born in Oxford, England, are most likely to believe in Darwin's theory of 
evolution than people who are born in Oxford, Mississippi.  I'm sure people who are 
born in New York are more likely to believe in relativity than people who are born in 
New Guinea.  
What does that say about whether evolution or relativity is true?  Nothing.  The genesis 
of a belief, how you came to it, has nothing to do with whether or not that belief can be 
sustained as a matter of argument.  The reality is, and we keep hearing a lot about 
Darwin because the last good argument against God came out in 1850 -- in the 1850s, 
science has made a whole bunch of discoveries since then but they point in the opposite 
direction. 
 
19:27:06 
 
And, therefore, what you find very often from atheists is now highly complicated 
defensive maneuvers to account for things that atheists resisted all the way.  When the 
discovery of the big bang came -- this, by the way, was at a time when most scientists 
believed the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrine 
of American and Western science -- so it came as a shock that the universe had a 
beginning.  Why?  Because, in a way, it wasn't just that matter had a beginning, but 
space and time also had a beginning.  In other words, this was something that the 
ancient Hebrews had said thousands of years ago and without conducting a single 
scientific experiment.  By the way, this is not the same as other cosmologies.  Other 
ancient cosmologies posited the universe being fashioned by a kind of carpenter god 
who made it out of some preexisting stuff, but the ancient Hebrews said, "No, first there 
was nothing, and then there was a universe." 
 
19:28:05 
 
By the way, that's almost identical to what Lawrence Krauss said, "First, there was 
nothing, no particles, no energy, no laws, and then there was the universe," completely 
consistent to what -- with what Christians believe, and exactly said by the ancient 
Hebrews thousands of years ago without doing a single experiment but solely on the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

basis of, "God told us."  And the astounding fact is that 2,000 years later, modern 
science, after climbing round and round the mountain, has arrived at the top only to 
find a bunch of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
Now, the fine-tuned universe is -- has become now a tremendous embarrassment to 
atheism.  Why?  Because ultimately it shows that the laws and constants of nature are 
fine-tuned, not only for the existence of life, but specifically for human life. 
 
19:29:01 
 
I want to note that this is an argument completely immune to Darwinian attack.  This is 
not about whether the horse, the dog, and the wolf had a common ancestor.  Let's 
remember that evolution, powerful theory as it is, is not a theory of life.  It is only a 
theory of transitions between life forms.  It's not about the origin of life, it's simply 
about how life form A gave rise to life form B.  And the fact is that there have to be 
certain conditions, self-replicating cells, an old universe, an old earth that are necessary 
for evolution to take place.  In other words, the fine-tuned universe is a precondition of 
Darwinian evolution itself.  We are living at a time when religious believers do not need 
to be afraid of science; they should, as I do, embrace science and welcome science 
because correctly understood, far from pointing away from God, science thrillingly 
points to God.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:30:03 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Dinesh DSouza.  And that concludes round 1 of this Intelligence Squared 
U.S. debate, where the motion is "science refutes God."  Now, keep in mind how you 
voted at the beginning of the evening, remember we're going to ask you to vote again at 
the conclusion and the team that has changed the most minds at the end of the debate 
will declared our winner.  Now we go on to round two, where the debaters address each 
other directly and also take questions from you in the audience and from me.  We have 
two teams of two, they're arguing out this motion: science refutes God.  Lawrence 
Krauss and Michael Shermer are arguing for the motion, and they are basically making 
the argument -- number one, they're saying they are not arguing that science disproves 
God, but that science makes the possibility of the existence very, very unlikely.  They 
point out, their argument, that the universe is so badly designed, actually, for human 
life, that it's highly unlikely that anybody would've thought this up. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

19:30:59 
 
They also say that God is a human creation, that this is established in history, 
psychology, anthropology, and that in the past God was the answer to a question that 
science has now answered more and more successfully.  The team arguing against the 
motion, Dinesh DSouza and Ian Hutchinson, are making the argument that belief in 
God, number one, is very rational; number two, that there is evidence for the existence 
of God, it's just not evidence that one would call scientific.  That, in fact, science is not 
capable of answering the kinds of questions that God answers, such as, "Why are we 
here?"  The "why?" questions, where do we go afterwards?  They also say that the 
arguments being made on the -- by the other side, that are based on social sciences like 
anthropology and psychology, are pop science; and therefore, I believe, to be 
disqualified. 
 
19:31:54 
 
So we're going to take questions from you and from me, but I want to start by actually 
getting to something I'm very curious about, and that's the issue of miracles.  I want to 
put to this side, you in particular, Ian Hutchinson, who is arguing against the notion that 
science refutes God, what is a miracle if not a violation of the laws of physics?  And is 
that what it is, in addition to all of its other implications?  Does it not violate the laws of 
physics?  And if it does so, how does -- how is that even possible?  And how does that fit 
into this argument? 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
So what we call the laws of physics, from a Christian point of view, are the way that God 
normally orders the universe.  It's the normal behavior of things around about us.  And 
Boyle, who was one of the founders of the Royal Society, wrote a whole a book about 
what nature is, and what he advocated was that what we mean or should mean by 
"nature," is the normal course of events.  Now, of course, miracles are not the normal 
course of events.  And, by the way, it didn't take science to tell us that; you know, 
people in the first century knew that people don't rise from the dead when they've been 
hung on crosses, and people knew that women don't bear children unless, well, you 
know what.  
 
19:33:09 
 
You know, this is not something that modern science has been necessary to tell us.  So, 
yes, miracles are abnormal events; usually, abnormal -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Why does science not refute those things?  As in -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Ian Hutchinson: 
It is simply not the case that you have to presume that the laws of nature are universally 
inviolable; it is simply not necessary to do science to do that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Lawrence Krauss. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
That's ridiculous.  
 
[laughter] 
 
In fact, it's ridiculous to the science that you do.  When you do science, you're 
presuming that the results of an experiment in your laboratory apply in another 
laboratory. 
 
19:33:46 
 
The fundamental claim that -- if you just -- miracles in your particular religion -- it's kind 
of remarkable that these violations of the laws of nature only occurred before video 
cameras and Intelligence Squared and the internet, and that you have these remarkable 
violations of the laws of nature in a book, which I was really surprised to hear Dinesh call 
a scientific document, the bible.   I hope he really didn't mean that.  St. Augustine would 
be very upset with you, because he said the Bible wasn't scientific.  But these violations 
of the law of nature -- laws of nature only occurred at a time when there was no 
evidence for them -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But, Lawrence -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
And you believe them.  
 
John Donvan: 
Lawrence, but is there a logical argument, again, that you can make against miracles?  
Not the "I didn't see them and nobody's seen them lately" argument.  But is there a 
logical argument you can make against them? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Our logic is determined by nature, not by what we'd like.  And nature has told us that 
miracles don't happen.  That's it.  It's not what I want or what I think should be rational. 
 It's, do they happen?  And there's no evidence that they've ever happened. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
Dinesh DSouza. 
 
19:34:56 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
I think we have here a deep fallacy.  And the fact that it remains a fallacy shows that 
what is being called science is actually hiding behind a philosophical principle.  It was the 
philosopher Hume who pointed out 200 years ago that from no amount of empirical 
generalizations, however large, can you draw a general law that is true as a matter of 
logic.  What I mean is, it doesn't matter how often you measure something.  Let's say 
you measure the speed at which this pen falls down.  You can measure it a million times. 
 But you don't know that on a star ten light years away or in some other condition 
where you haven't measured it, that if you drop this pen, it will fall at the same speed. 
 Science presumes it.  It doesn't prove -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
We measure.  I'm sorry.  We measure it. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Let me finish it.  Right.  But you can't measure it always and everywhere.  And you 
haven't measured it 10,000 years ago.  You're assuming that -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Yes, we have. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
-- 10,000 -- No.  You're assuming that 10,000 years ago it happened at the same speed. 
 And your measurement is based on that.  So Hume's point is this:  Science provides 
general propositions based on experience, but he said we should always be willing to 
accept new experience that proves the opposite.  A good example of this in Western 
philosophy -- 
 
19:36:12 
 
John Donvan: 
Before you go to the example, let me let Michael Shermer come in and respond to 
where you've gone so far with that. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Sure. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Right.  So like a popular thing in Skeptic magazine, there's psychics and people that can 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

telekinetically move objects with their mind or so on.  And there's an example of this 
where there's a man who can move the cursor on his computer just by thinking about it.  
Now, it turns out he's a quadriplegic, and he has a chip in his brain that enables him to 
do this.  But if you don't know about the chip, it looks like a miracle.  Once you know the 
technology, it's no longer miraculous.  This is Arthur C. Clarke's third law.  Any 
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  I contend that there's 
no such thing as the supernatural or the paranormal.  There's just the natural, the 
normal and the stuff we haven't explained yet.  And when something unusual like that 
happens, we should go searching for the mechanism behind it.  Is there a chip in the 
brain?  So if it's true that, say, God heals cancers or whatever due to prayer, this should 
be a measurable thing because this is what we -- 
 
19:37:08 
 
John Donvan: 
But what about Dinesh's point that just because something has happened 10,000 times 
and that that's your case, that it's always going to happen.  And he's saying logically, you 
don't actually know that it's always going to happen just because it's happened 10,000 
times. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Okay.  Fine, fine, fine.   
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
[unintelligible] say that in fact that's very important.  Science -- I agree with you in that. 
 Science could only prove was wrong, not something that's absolute true.  So you're 
right.  If I drop a ball a million times, and it falls, I, in principle, could imagine an 
experience where it wouldn't.  But it's highly likely it's going to fall the next time.  But 
you use the keyword, "experience."  We wait then for an experience that contradicts 
the known laws.  So if tonight when I looked up at the sky, the stars rearranged 
themselves that I am here in Aramaic or ancient Greek or whatever you want, then I 
might say, you know, there's something to it.  But the point is there's been no -- there's 
been no experience that violates the fact that the laws have existed throughout all time. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
19:38:01 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Lawrence, you haven't had such an experience. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Right. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Ian Hutchinson: 
But there are probably people in this room who have.  So the question fundamentally 
comes down to what counts as empirical.  And in science, of course, what counts as 
empirical are things that we can do experiments on, we can do repeated observations. 
 So science depends upon reproducibility.  But if we were to reduce some phenomenon 
to a reproducible behavior, we would have reduced it not into an explanation, a 
definition of what a miracle is.  We would have reduced it into magic, or we would have 
reduced it in a new law of nature.  So it's in the nature of miracle that it can't be 
reduced into scientific form.  And in the end, science becomes essentially powerless to 
say, one way or another, whether a miracle -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
-- a miracle that happened, and tell me one that happened that you can show 
happened. 
 
19:38:58 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's let Michael Shermer answer. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
But even so, even if there was one, aren't you curious as a scientist how God performed 
the miracle, what forces of nature she used and so on to make it happen? 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Of course.  And so, for example, so we would say, as Christians, for example, that -- 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Thank you. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
-- the big bang, the creation of the universe, was a miracle.  Why was it a miracle?  
Because it used no known law of nature.  It was in a sense supernatural.  The universe. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
But that's just because you didn't understand it.

Dinesh DSouza: 
But you haven't -- see, here is the thing.  When we talk about experiments and 
reproducible things, you're talking, for example, let's take, for example, are there beings 
on other planets, right?  It's an empirical question.  Right now. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
In principle, it's an empirical question, yes. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Empirical question.  Right now, there is no evidence that there are creatures in outer 
space. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Yes. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Therefore, have you refuted that belief? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
No.  But it's not an illogical one like the notion that -- 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
You haven't refuted it because -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
What? 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
You haven't refuted it because you haven't produced -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
It doesn't require me to suspend the laws of physics in order to believe it. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
But if I were to believe in creatures in outer space, I wouldn't be irrational, would I? 
 
19:40:02 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no, but you've got to respond to the point he just made.  It would not require 
suspension of the laws of physics in order for you to believe there are creatures in outer 
space.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Dinesh DSouza: 
Right.  And I would say that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But miracles do. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
No.  Miracles simply say that the laws of physics are incomplete, that the laws of physics 
are generalizations that reflect the limits of human knowledge.  These aren't nature's 
laws.  They're Newton's laws.  And it took an Einstein to modify them. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
So when the sun stood -- so these biblical scientists who thought that the sun went 
around the earth because that's what they thought when they were writing, when the 
sun stopped in the sky, of course, had the sun been going around the earth, that would 
be fine.  But we now know that actually the earth goes around the sun.  And the fact 
that the sun moves in the skies and the fact that the earth rotates.  So had the sun 
stopped in the sky, the stopping of the rotation of the earth would have produced 
forces which would have destroyed all life on the planet.  But that somehow doesn't 
violate the basic classical physics.  But -- and every now and then, that's possible? 
 
19:41:02 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Who are these biblical scientists you're talking about? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Well, you know, the horn blowing, the sun stopping. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
The people who thought that the earth was the center of the universe and the sun went 
around it were Christians who, like non-Christians, were taught by scientists.  That's 
where they got the idea.  They weren't biblical scientists.  They got it from you guys.

I didn't mean it that way.  I didn't mean it that way.  I think I hear an interesting 
challenge, in that Lawrence is saying that if a miracle were to occur, that it has ripple 
effects and a broad -- it doesn't just affect the people who are witnessing the miracle. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Okay. 
 
John Donvan: 
But if -- for example, if the earth stopped because the trumpets are blowing, on the 
other side of the earth, you know, some tribe doesn't know what's going on, but 
suddenly the earth has stopped for them too.  How do they explain it? 
 
19:41:56 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
So in the 18th century, as science really got going, people thought that there were 
deterministic laws of physics and that once you understood the initial conditions, you 
could solve those laws and the result was absolutely determined.  I think Lawrence will 
agree that what science has found out in the 20th century is that that is simply not true, 
that there is, in the universe as a whole, as we discover it by science, some deep 
uncertainties, some undefined behavior which, in the end, cannot be considered to be 
deterministic.  In other words, a deterministic universe in which there's no room for God 
to operate is simply not the way we think about the universe as physicists these days. 
 
John Donvan: 
Michael Shermer. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Let's say, Ian, that petitionary prayer actually works.  Again, as a physicist -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Petitionary prayer, you mean, I would like something to happen, and you pray for it. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Petitioning to the deity to, say, cure my cancer or whatever.  And it happens.  Wouldn't 
you be curious to know how the deity or whatever it is reaches into the world, stirs the 
particles, reconfigures the DNA so the cancer cells quit replicating so rapidly and so on. 
 
19:43:08 
 
And the moment you figure that out as a scientist, it would no longer be a miracle.  It 
wouldn't be supernatural.  It would just be part of nature.  It's like, so if I recant this 
prayer six times between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m., this is the effect.  It's a measurable,

determined thing.  That's just now incorporated as part of science. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Well, let's be clear that it's never been a religious position that if we have a natural 
explanation for something, that means that God is absent or that God didn't do it.  It's 
always been a biblical viewpoint that even on things which we know are part of nature, 
God can be considered to be active in those things.  So while this discussion on miracles 
is interesting in itself, one shouldn't be misled into thinking that the only place that God 
can act in the world is through those things which are so extraordinary that 
[unintelligible]. 
 
19:44:00 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
John, I just want to correct an error that -- I mean, I don't think you [unintelligible], -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Lawrence Krauss. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
-- so I want to just make it clear.  The laws of physics are deterministic.  The Schrödinger 
equation which is the basis of quantum mechanics is a second order differential 
equation, and, therefore, the laws are deterministic.  Our observations aren't 
deterministic, but the underlying laws are deterministic.  Nothing's changed in 400 
years.  And so it's really important -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
-- there’s no way the universe isn't deterministic. 
 
Male Speaker: 
–it’s governed by quantum mechanics. 
 
John Donvan: 
Just one thing, because we got into four syllables, and I'm not that smart. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Just give us a working definition of the word "deterministic." You mean -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
You start with an initial condition for the equations of quantum mechanics, and the 
evolution of the system is determined unambiguously --  



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Male Speaker: 
It has to happen. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
It has no uncertainty.  Your measurement of the system has uncertainty, but the 
evolution of the underlying system is completely determined. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
You know, I'll accept the slight correction -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Good. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
-- that -- but the point, nevertheless, remains exactly the way I said it, which is that the 
universe is not deterministic. 
 
19:45:02 
 
What science does is try to explain the universe by deterministic laws, and by looking at 
the world and trying to say, "How is it completely reproducible and in accordance with 
these universal laws?"  And what it finds out is that no matter how hard we try, we're 
actually unable to have a complete description of the universe of that type.  And this 
was such a shock that even as great a scientist as Albert Einstein was repelled by it -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
That's wrong. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
-- and that's why he said, you know, "God doesn't play dice with the world," because he 
just could not abide it.  But I would say by and large the majority of physicists today 
think that Einstein was probably wrong and that actually there is inherent large -- 
 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  One quick response and then we'll move on. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Yeah, I guess what I want to say is it's not -- we don't have a complete description, we 
do, quantum mechanics as far as we can tell is a complete description.  We have a 
complete description of the probabilities.

We know with 100 percent accuracy if you perform the experiments that were 
described in the paper under your name, that with a distribution, the results will occur 
with a different -- with that distribution exactly.  And, of course, because they did, you 
were able to write your paper.  
 
John Donvan: 
So to the side -- [coughs] excuse me -- to the side against the motion that "Science --" 
the motion that "Science refutes God," is it your position that there are certain things 
that science can know and then there are certain things that science can't know, 
therefore, it doesn't refute God?  But what is in this world -- Dinesh, you talked a little 
bit about this universe of things that science can't handle, explain, such as why we are 
here -- that -- how large is that category of things that we can't know, and is science just 
irrelevant to that category of knowledge? 
 
Dinesh D’Souza: 
There are some questions in which Christians and religious believers are making factual 
claims, "God made the universe."  It's a factual claim.  Either he did or he didn't.  There 
is life after death.  We may have no way to find out, but that's a factual claim, either 
there is or there isn't. 
 
19:47:00 
 
"The resurrection happened," either it did or it didn't.  Now, religion also makes moral 
claims, "This is how you should live.  This is a happy life," and so on, so religion operates 
in two domains.  The second domain is untouchable by science.  Science can try to give 
accounts of how morality originated, but that's not the same thing as what you should 
and shouldn't do. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well -- 
 
Dinesh D’Souza: 
So -- 
 
John Donvan: 
-- but just be more clear about that distinction.  
 
Dinesh D’Souza: 
Well -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But we want to go straight to the other side about that.  
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Dinesh D’Souza: 
Well, science can say that we evolved a desire for cooperation out of Darwinian 
evolution, but that doesn't say if there's a famine in Haiti if I should give money or no.  
So in other words the content of morality is unaffected by science although science can 
give an account of the origin of morality. 
 
John Donvan: 
But not the -- what is actually right or wrong. 
 
Dinesh D’Souza: 
Yeah. 
 
Dinesh D’Souza: 
And the other thing is -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me -- before you move on, let me go to Michael Shermer on that. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Well, so where do we get our morals from?  It can't be from the Bible because almost 
nobody obeys certainly not the Old Testament.  And most of the New Testament-- I 
mean, death penalty for adultery, there goes half of Congress.  I mean, nobody -- 
 
19:48:01 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- nobody is going to do this, right?  So we pick and choose.  We cherry pick from the 
Holy Book based on something else, something else that's happened that I referenced in 
my opening statement of there's been this other change that's happened, this 
secularization of morality.  That is, you have to actually have good reasons for why you 
hold certain moral principles, and you should be able to articulate them.  And so that's 
been the changer.  So even if you and I both listen to the still small voice within to 
decide what's right or wrong, Dinesh, I'm claiming you're not getting it from the Bible 
and I'm not either, we're getting it from somewhere else.  I think we've evolved this 
propensity to have moral emotions, and then culture tweaks them, and we've been 
getting progressively more moral. 
 
John Donvan: 
But how -- what's telling us what is actually right or wrong? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
But I think science does tell us what's right and wrong -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
[unintelligible] Lawrence Krauss speak.  
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
I think science does tell us what's right and wrong in a real way. 
 
John Donvan: 
Really? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Yeah, we have learned -- for example, the scientific facts that certain animals can suffer, 
for example, affects our decision of whether -- of how we should treat those animals, 
whether we should eat them or not eat them, or the scientific evidence that certain 
people of certain colors don't have different intellects, different capabilities has changed 
the way we deal with other humans.  
 
19:49:16 
 
John Donvan: 
But if -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Science has determined the way we behave in the modern world. 
 
John Donvan: 
And science is telling us what's right or wrong. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Yeah, I think so because it's telling us how the world actually works. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ian Hutchinson. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
I don't think it's the case that it tells us right or wrong.  I think science does often inform 
us in ways that help us to implement our morals and our ethics more effectively, more 
fairly, more accurately, and more truly.  But in the end it cannot tell us whether it's right 
or wrong to do something because categories of right and wrong aren't scientific 
categories.  
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Well, the Bible certainly doesn't tell us, either. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Ian Hutchinson: 
Well -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Where do you get it from? 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Yeah, where do you get it? 
 
[laughter] 
 
I mean, does God -- does God speak to you and tell you? 
 
19:49:55 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
I'll answer that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Dinesh DSouza. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
First of all, we don't get, none of us, morality from the Bible.  It's not like I read the read 
the Ten Commandments and went, "Oh, stealing is wrong, wow.  Didn't know that 
before.  Killing is wrong, incredible."  I already knew that.  
 
Male Speaker: 
Exactly. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
How did I know it?  I knew it because of what Adam Smith calls the impartial spectator, 
the voice of conscience.  So it is the contention of religious believers that the voice of 
conscience has been implanted in us by God.  Now, you say it comes from evolution, 
and we say it could have been implanted in us by God through evolution.  Now, just to 
say that science tells us facts doesn't mean that science changes our morality.  If I were 
to step on a stage and stomp on a dog, there'd be a universal wave of revulsion in the 
audience, although presumably the matter would be more controversial if it were a cat, 
but -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- science -- my point is science can tell us the dog feels pain.  But the idea that we 
shouldn't cause pain to others, that's a moral proposition.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

19:51:01 
 
Science is merely altering the fact which puts that moral principle into motion.  So we 
have widened our circles of morality based upon new facts, and science can provide 
those, but science isn't actually telling us what's right or wrong at all. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to go in a moment to you in the audience to take questions, and when we do, I 
just want to remind you what our format is.  We'd like you to raise your hand, I'll call on 
you, a microphone will be brought to you, we really need you to wait for the 
microphone so the radio broadcast can hear you, and hold it about this distance, a fist 
distance from your mouth.  We'd appreciate it if you could tell us your name, if you 
could really ask a question that's on this topic of science refuting God, and if you can be 
terse.   
 
So while we're getting set up for that, I want to remind you that we are in the question 
and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan, your 
moderator.  We have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it out over this motion: 
science refutes God. 
 
19:51:56 
 
To the team that is arguing for the motion that science refutes God, I want to ask you 
somewhat of a personal question.  Can a scientist believe in God and still be a 
functioning scientist? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Absolutely, there are -- there are -- there are functioning scientists who can believe in 
God; there are functioning scientists who are pedophiles -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- there are functioning scientists who are -- no, I'm serious, I mean, the point is 
scientists are human-- 
 
John Donvan: 
Woah, woah, but that was a -- that was a -- that was a very, very, very rough grouping 
that you just did. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Well, in the Catholic church it's not so different, but --

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
I don't know. I don't know in the spirit of this thing, if you want to step back from that.  
 
[laughter] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Okay, but what -- yeah -- okay, but what I want to point out is that people can believe -- 
people are not fully rational.  The point is -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No, I'm asking -- the question is, "Can you be a good scientist and believe in God?" 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
As long as you don't take the God into the laboratory.  As a very famous biologist said, 
"When I go in the laboratory, I become an atheist, because when I believe -- when I 
twiddle the knobs in my experiment, I don't believe there's some angel affecting the 
results of the experiment, and if I believe that in laboratory, why should I believe it 
outside?"  Some people choose to believe it outside; the minute they take it into the 
laboratory, they stop being good scientists. 
 
19:53:06 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
But that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Ian Hutchinson. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
That's actually quite -- 
 
[applause] 
 
That's actually quite contrary to history.  I mean, what got modern science going in the 
first place was a belief in the faithfulness of God, of a creator who'd made a rational 
creation.  And a good case can be made that the reason why science as we know it, 
modern science, grew up in the west, was in part because Christianity, in its 
philosophical and theological viewpoints, including the belief in God and God's 
faithfulness, served as a kind of hospitable environment in which that science could 
grow up.  So it's actually not the case that the scientists of history had to say to 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

themselves "I'm going to become an atheist when I go into the lab."  Many of them 
went into the lab precisely because they were not atheists. 
 
19:54:00 
 
John Donvan: 
But I get the sense, though, that the other side is arguing that as science progressed, as 
the years went by, the more that science developed, and the more that scientists knew, 
the more tempting atheism became for them because of the volume and because of the 
discoveries, and because they found inconsistencies.  What about that?  Do you want to 
take that, Dinesh DSouza?  
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Well -- 
 
John Donvan: 
They learned -- they knew too much after a while is -- 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
I think there's a presumption that science explains the material world, and science does 
it with material explanations -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Just -- do you agree with that?  Yes or no? 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yes, okay. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Physical causes have physical -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Exactly. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Go on, Dinesh. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
So it is a presumption of modern science, not a proof, but a presumption that's beyond 
the material world, there is nothing.  So take, for example, the fact that as humans we 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

experience consciousness.  We know that there's something in us, consciousness, that 
can't be reduced simply to materialism.   
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
How do you know that?   
 
Dinesh D’Souza: 
Hold on a second.  No, no.  Hold on a second.  When you say, how do you know that? 
 You're presuming that it is.  Do you agree that the cause of consciousness is not known? 
 
19:55:07 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
The fact that something is not known does not imply it's God.  You better not get back 
on -- 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Right.  But neither -- so consciousness is an immaterial thing that may have a material 
explanation.  And the keyword is "may."  And yet you as a scientist believe it does. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
I don't believe anything.  I just want to learn how the world works-- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
-- you just said that all causes are material. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
I'll wait for the experiments and the theory. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Ah, okay.  So in other words, in other words, you're presuming -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Ah. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Male Speaker: 
Watch out. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
I'm simply saying, as a scientist you are closed off to the possibility of nonmaterial 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

explanations.  True or false? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
No.  I told you if the stars moved around today, I'd be really thinking there's some 
intelligence in the universe.  There's just never been such an observation.  So until there 
is, I'll assume the reasonable logical thing, since there's never been such an observation, 
there's unlikely to be one.  That's all.  As a scientist, I can say what's likely and what's 
unlikely.  I don't believe anything.  I can say, is this likely or unlikely.  That's all. 
 
19:56:02 
 
John Donvan: 
Dinesh. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
I think this is very important because throughout your book, you -- this is called ”A 
Universe from Nothing." 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Can you hold it up?   
 
Dinesh D’Souza: 
I have it right here. 
 
[laughter] 
 
I recommend it. 
 
John Donvan: 
What's the name of your book? 
 
Dinesh D’Souza: 
It's a very useful primer on the limits of science.  Here’s why. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Absolutely, the universe. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
So to quote a sample line, and there are many like this.  You say "getting something 
from nothing."  And then you say, "This is how our universe could have arisen."  And 
then you say, "I stress the word could here because we may never have enough 
empirical information."  Next page you say, "These are useful operational efforts to 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

describe how our universe might actually have originated."  Here's my point.  You're 
invoking "coulds" and "mights" and "maybes" to provide a refutation.  Now, even if you 
were successful in saying that I have an alternative possibility to God, you haven't 
refuted God.  You've simply given an alternative possibility. 
 
19:57:05 
 
So you have all these qualifications in the book, but then when you step up here, you 
act as a science that's demonstrated that the universe did in fact come from nothing, 
whereas you say, it never did.  You have not made that demonstration, and you admit it. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
[unintelligible] I was up there, I said it was plausible.  And plausible is remarkable 
because everything that's you've talked about in terms of religion is implausible.  So the 
point is that just like with evolution, a simple plausible assumption appears to work is 
remarkable and worth celebrating.  And so the reason I say "could" and "might" is 
because I'm honest.  And also because I haven't presumed the answer before I asked 
the question. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's go to some questions from you in the audience.  Right, gentleman in the blue shirt.  
If you could state your name. 
 
Gerry Ohrstrom: 
Thank you.  My name is Gerry Ohrstrom.  And my question is directed to the panelists 
opposing the motion. 
 
19:57:55 
 
Could you respond to Michael Shermer's assertion that in fact each of you are atheists 
999 times over, and your adoption of Christianity is merely a happenstance of the 
culture in which you grew up.  And does that itself not strain the credibility of your faith 
itself?  Could you respond to that? 
 
John Donvan: 
Dinesh DSouza. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Well, first of all, in my case, that is flatly untrue because I was born and raised in India.  
And the majority of religion of India is Hinduism.  The second largest faith are the 
Muslims.  And then you have the Jains and the Sikhs.  So from a very young age, the 
Christianity in which I was born was problematic and had to be measured against other 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

possibilities.  But once you begin to study the other religions, you discover something 
very interesting, and that is that the -- there are shared propositions of the different 
religions that point to core truths.  One scholar described it very well. 
 
19:58:57 
 
It's sort of like you have a mountain, and the top of the mountain, you have God.  But no 
one can see him.  And you have little rivers of knowledge pouring down.  And some of 
the waterfalls may begin higher or lower.  And you can look at the different religions of 
human attempts, flawed, to apprehend the same reality.  These attempts will disagree 
on certain particulars, but agree on many fundamentals.  So I don't see the other 
religions as wrong.  I see all of us in the human enterprise to try to gain knowledge that 
seems beyond the reach of the empirical. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ian, is your answer complementary? 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
I completely agree, but I wanted to expand on it just a little bit.  And that is to say that 
it's not a problem for Christians that this -- the idea that there is a universal religious 
impulse -- which we agree on.  I mean, there is basically a universal religious impulse in 
humans.  Because what Christians say is, if there is a god with whom we can have a 
meaningful relationship, then we would expect precisely that everyone would have such 
a religious impulse built into them. 
 
20:00:05 
 
And so when we look around and we see different religious view points, we recognize 
the universality of that.  So I don't -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But you think the other religions have got it wrong? 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Well, I mean "got it wrong" seems to me a rather unhelpful way to look at it. 
 
John Donvan: 
I mean, it's pretty direct. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Of course -- of course, you know, Christians think that Jesus was the son of God. 
 
John Donvan: 
But and the reason I put it that way is I think that your opponents' point and the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

questioner that he was bringing up is it's an accident of your birth-- particularly in your 
[unintelligible]. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
You know, it happens not to be the case for me.  I didn't grow up in a Christian family.  
So -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, Michael Shermer. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Just to clarify the point just briefly.  So you just eloquently described the geography of 
religious beliefs of India.  When Lawrence goes to lecture in India, he doesn't discover 
that they do physics differently in India.  They do physics everywhere around the world 
the same.  There's just one physics.  There's not, you know, Indian physics and 
Australian physics and so forth.  There's just one physics.  That's the larger point. 
 
20:01:13 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
You're right.  And that's because science limits itself to asking questions of very 
particular type, to asking how questions rather than why questions and asking questions 
about the reproducible behavior of the world and so on and so forth.  So yes, of course, 
science is universal, and that's one of the most attractive things about it, and that's why 
I'm a scientist.  But that doesn't mean it has a grip on everything. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
But it's more than universal.  It changes.  And I think, you know, Dinesh pointed out that 
-- 
 
John Donvan: 
Lawrence [unintelligible]. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
-- science is wrong.  But the fact that we changed our minds makes science -- gives 
science progress.  Different from religion.

And I find it interesting that we have a debate here about does science refute God.  And 
I -- my question is posed to both sides for and against the motion.  I have yet to hear 
anyone really give us a clear description of what they think God is.  We keep throwing 
around this term "God, God, God." 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, this side has made clear -- you don't really need the question to this side, I don't 
think, unless I misunderstand your question. 
 
Female Speaker: 
No, I just -- I'm hearing religion.  I'm hearing religion, different religions, different 
beliefs.  But I need to hear some kind of opinion or an argument for what your God is.  
How do you define your God.  How do you define your God? 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's do it very quickly and [unintelligible]. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
I thought I'd been pretty clear about the god that I was talking about.  And I said that it 
was the god of Christianity. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
And for me, the god I was talking about, for which there's no evidence, is the fact that 
there's intelligent, guiding purpose to the universe.  That's a vague deism.  The -- 
because that's the most charitable God I can imagine, that obviously the god of the 
major world's religions is obviously in contradiction with everything we know. 
 
20:03:10 
 
John Donvan: 
But that's the god you're saying doesn't exist. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
That's the god I'm talking about. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Let's move on.  Sir. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Hi.  Matthew [unintelligible].  I don't have any particularly exciting qualifications of being 
here, I'm sorry to report.  My question is to Dinesh.  And it relates to his point about 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

ancient Hebrews and also his latter reference that we're instilled with some form of 
morality.  So on these guys, the same guys who, for example, thought that it was okay to 
stone a woman to death, the -- 
 
John Donvan: 
You know what?  I -- I don't want to get into a discussion -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Well, the point I'm trying to make is, were these the guys we should really have listened 
to all along in any instance? 
 
John Donvan: 
It's really off the topic of the clash I feel between science and God.  I -- so I, with respect, 
want to move on to another question.  Sir.  Yeah. 
 
20:04:16 
 
Male Speaker: 
[unintelligible].  I want to address Mr. Krauss, as far as the likeliness of -- unlikeliness of 
scientific event.  In order to say that the likeliness of universe came in from nothing 
without intelligent design, you have to throw out the basic laws of conservation.  You 
have to imagine that the universe is infinite, at the beginning, at the very first 
nanosecond of creation.  Isn't it easier and isn't it more likely physically to assume that, 
that first particle, the mass, the matter, the energy, the intellect is the same as that 
mass, that energy, the matter, the intellect of the whole universe is? 
 
20:05:21 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Okay, let me -- I think I can interpret your question.  And -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I need -- if you do -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
-- try and interpret it in a way and if I -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you restate it? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
And if I misrepresent it, you can tell me, but I think you're trying to say that somehow in 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

the creation of the universe we have to violate conservation laws and we have to 
assume things that are unreasonable, that the creation of the universe violates the laws 
of nature. 
 
Male Speaker: 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
I was trying to make it sensible, but, okay. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Male Speaker: 
No, what I've just tried  to say is -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, I can give you 10 more seconds to -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Okay, all I was trying to say is in order to say that it was created from nothing, we have 
to violate the -- 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Oh, yeah, no, and that's a -- it's a great question.  
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
It came from nothing.  You appear to have to spout nonsense. 
 
20:06:03 
 
But the amazing thing, the amazing thing, which is what's worth celebrating, is that 
we've discovered, for example, that you can have a whole universe full of 100 billion 
galaxies, each containing 100 billion stars and the total energy of the universe can be 
zero.  And, in fact, when we go out and measure the total energy of our universe, it's 
consistent with zero.  You don't have to violate anything to get something from nothing. 
 And that was a surprise to scientists, but it's the case.  And it didn't have to be the case. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I want to move on.  And I want to assume again I'm not that smart a guy 
situation. 
 
[laughter]

I just hear we're a big zero just there. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Yeah, it's a big zero, we are. 
 
John Donvan: 
I don't think I like that very much.  Right in the center there, the scarf, please. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Can you explain the creation of an orchid, and, as scientists, do you believe that you will 
ever be in a place where you will be able to create an orchid? 
 
20:07:03 
 
John Donvan: 
Why do you feel that an orchid -- are you saying that an orchid needs to be a godlike 
creation? 
 
Female Speaker: 
I could think -- you know, it's just a simple -- really simple question, and -- 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Well, we have an -- we have good answers to that. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Okay. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
I mean, the evolution of flowering plants is there in coevolution with insects.  There's a 
reason why orchids and other flowers look like insects, to mimic insects so that the real 
insects try to mate with them and move the pollen around.  And so what we perceive as 
aesthetically beautiful or so on, of course, looks very different to the eyeball of an 
insect.  It has a different worldview, in that sense, because evolution selected for it to 
do a certain thing.  Otherwise it wouldn't look that way. 
 
Male Speaker: 
But were you [inaudible] you actually create -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
-- I just want to -- were you referring to the beauty of an orchid or just the existence of 
an orchid?

Female Speaker: 
The existence [inaudible] getting at [inaudible]. 
 
20:07:54 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Yeah, in fact, actually I would say -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Lawrence Krauss. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
And it's scary, and you might not like it, but the universe isn't here so you could like it, 
no, I mean, I know -- so I'm going to tell you something and I think it's likely.  In fact, my 
friend, Craig Ventor, would create organisms by putting together the appropriate 
genome of those organisms.  And I suspect for better -- hold on -- for better -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
[inaudible] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
-- for better or worse we'll be able to put together molecule by molecule the genome of 
something that will reproduce and produce an orchid.  We'll have life where there 
wasn't life before.  That is scary, and you might -- and we have to understand what 
we're doing when we're not yet capable of doing that, but we will be one day, and 
unless we accept that possibility we won't be able to as a society determine what 
constraints we should put on ourselves so we have a sense of a policy.  But we will do it. 
 
20:08:49 
 
John Donvan: 
Need some morality on that one.  I want to move on.  Right down in front here. 
 
Female Speaker:

sure.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[laughter] 
 
A single shred of evidence, that's all. 
 
John Donvan: 
Other side. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
You know, I'm not even sure I could be persuaded unless we changed the meaning of 
what science is because coming back to the previous question, how would you measure 
the beauty of an orchid scientifically?  I think, really, science sets itself out, in a way, to 
fail.  And don't forget the motion is "science refutes God," not that, you know, "there is 
no God," but that science refutes God. 
 
20:10:01 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Well, in a way we do measure beauty.  The marketplace of people that buy flowers, 
essentially, determine how the breeders create them, based on the ones that most 
people find really beautiful.  There actually is a measurable way for that. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  That was a great question, by the way.  Thanks a lot.  On this side. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Hi, my name is Mike.  I live on the Upper West side; I'm not from here, obviously.  This is 
a question to Ian and Dinesh.  Is there an observed phenomena for which the religious 
explanation has progressed ahead of the scientific explanation in terms of plausibility? 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
I'll answer that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Dinesh DSouza. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
If you look at the bible, it is not a science manual; it doesn't claim to make scientific 
proofs.  In fact, what's interesting about the bible is it doesn't make proofs at all.  The 
bible doesn't even attempt to prove God; it doesn't try to prove that Jesus is the son of 
God; it asserts things. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
20:11:04 
 
Why?  Because for the most part, what the bible is doing is it's in the province of 
revelation. Now, you'll notice that neither of us have ever in this debate appealed to the 
bible to support any argument that we made.  We have argued on the basis of reason 
alone.  Now, the bible does make certain claims about the world and about man.  So, for 
example, the bible doesn't say that God made man out of nothing, but it does say that 
God made the universe out of nothing; it says that it made man out of some other stuff. 
 Now, so the Bible says God created the world and God created man, but the bible 
doesn't say how. 
 
 
So that's where science comes in.  Science can, and the scientific answer often changes, 
attempt to give explanations that actually don't refute the bible.  You could refute the 
bible by showing that, actually, the universe has always existed and doesn't require any 
explanation whatsoever. 
 
20:11:58 
 
You could show that God didn't make man out of the clay of the ground, but, as Richard 
Dawkins said," aliens brought man from outer space."  So you can actually refute 
propositions that are stated in the bible -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me -- 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
-- but I think Ian's right that no central proposition has ever been refuted, let alone 
today. 
 
John Donvan: 
Lawrence has had his head in his hand listening to this. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Well, I mean, I -- you know, you don't really want to -- you don't really want to go here, 
Dinesh.  So I would say, for example, we refute the bible by arguing that creating day 
and night before you create the sun is pretty silly. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Well, Lawrence, in that case -- here's the problem: you have a fundamentalist reading of 
the bible that has -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Lawrence Krauss: 
[unintelligible] 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
-- hold on -- that maybe -- that is maybe subscribed to by 3 percent of Christians and 100 
percent of atheists. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
But you just gave a fundamentalist -- no, but you just gave -- 
 
[applause] 
 
You just -- 
[unintelligible] that -- why I brought that up, because I thought you were essentially 
repeating a fundamentalist assertion that, somehow, the bible makes some scientific 
claims that are substantial.  And the whole point is you don't want to go there, because 
you and I know that a fundamentalist interpretation of the bible leads to nonsense.  We 
both agree about that, right? 
 
20:13:05 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
We both agree that there are fundamentalist factual claims that are so-called "creation 
science" that are nonsense.  We agree on that. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
So that -- so that case is science refutes those claims. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Absolutely. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Okay.  Well you just answered this question. 
 
John Donvan: 
We are in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I'm 
John Donvan, your moderator.  We have four debaters, two teams of two, debating this 
motion:  science refutes God.  Ian Hutchinson wants to pick up -- 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Well, I do want to come back and try to answer this question.  And the import of that 
question was that theology as such has made no contribution to human knowledge or 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

development; and that's a claim that Lawrence has made in his book, okay? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
In the last 500 years or so, yeah. 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Yeah, so the last 500 years.  And I just want to make one comment on that.  If you said -- 
just as an example, if you think about the Reformation; the Reformation probably 
brought about the biggest transformation of human learning, knowledge, of the entire 
recorded history.  And what caused the Reformation?  Well, I guess Luther.  Oh, what 
was Luther?  Hmm, a theologian.  
 
20:14:10 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
And I can add to this.  So right now, when we deal with war, all western war is 
conducted according to the principles of the just war.  That's why, for example, after 
9/11, when America was bombing Taliban targets, we were dropping food to feed 
civilians on the enemy side.  Now, where does the idea that you can kill combatants but 
not civilians come from?  Did science teach us that?  Nonsense.  
 
John Donvan: 
Question [unintelligible] -- 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
-- It comes straight out of Christianity, the principles of the just war that guide the 
knowledge of how we act today.  
 
John Donvan: 
Question over on the far side, please. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Hi.  My name's John.  And earlier in the debate, we were talking about how science can 
prove or establish what is right and wrong.  My question for you, Mr. Krauss, is how 
does science tell us that the publishing of [a photo of] the man before his death went 
publish -- when pushed in front of the train is right or wrong.  Do you understand? 
 
20:15:08 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Well -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
I don't.  So -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Earlier in the debate we were talking about how science can tell us what is right or 
wrong. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah. 
 
Male Speaker: 
My question for Mr. Krauss is that how can science tell us that the publishing of the 
picture of the man before his death when pushed in front of a train is right or wrong? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
I know.  Yesterday's --okay, well, you know, we -- we've got to step back for a second. 
 And my point was that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Lawrence, is this going to take us in a relevant direction? 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
I think -- I'll try and answer in 10 or 15 seconds.  And you can decide. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
The point is -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I might decide in advance. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Ten seconds. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Precognition.  The point is that you can't decide what is right or wrong unless you know 
the consequences of your actions.  Science determines the consequences of your 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

actions.  So a precursor to determining to what's right or wrong is to know how the 
world really works. 
 
20:16:00 
 
For example, if you thought the person was pushed on the train would be hit by the 
train and then get up and walk away, you'd have very different actions.  And so that's 
what I mean by ultimately understanding how the universe works as a precursor to 
making decisions to making moral decisions. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  21 seconds.  Sir, right down here.  Can you stand up and wait for the microphone, 
please.  You will be our youngest ever questioner.  There is no pressure on you 
whatsoever. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Male Speaker: 
My name is David.  And I'm a student at Collegiate school.  And I would like to know, 
from a -- the side for the motion, whether -- what your stance would be -- or what you 
would say to somebody that has a spiritual experience, not really -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's let Michael Shermer take that question. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
Yeah.  So we get this a lot.  You know, how do you explain this or that?  I think people's 
experiences are real, absolutely.  I think most people don't just make up stories, 
although some do.  Most people when they experience what they describe some 
miraculous, fantastic spiritual experience that they've had, they really mean it. 
 
20:17:06 
 
Now, so the question is, what does it represent?  Something out there in the world or 
something inside the brain?  Well, we now know enough about neuroscience to know 
that the brain does generate a lot of these kind of spiritual experiences, near death 
experiences, out of body experiences, sense presences, hallucinations, delusions. 
 There's whole books about this.  And so the experiences are real.  What we want to 
know as scientists is what do they actually represent.  I mean, we know we can replicate 
these in the lab by doing certain things and causing people's brains to have these 
experiences.  So most likely, the what's more likely question, that it's out there or that 
it's in here.  The overwhelming evidence is that they're in here. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
Good question.  And I want to actually take it to the other side.   Michael is basically 
arguing that some of those things that you're talking about it's your brain talking to you 
but not in the way that you think it is.  Dinesh DSouza. 
 
20:17:57 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Well, hallucinations, yes.  I mean, if someone said that they saw a UFO, I would say, how 
do you know?  And they might say, well, I was with my buddies.  We were sitting outside 
our trailer park.  We were drinking beer.  And I would say, well, yeah, I probably won't 
believe that.  But we're talking here about an experience that has been had by perhaps 
90 percent of people in the world from the beginning of time.  That's a different 
standard -- 
 
John Donvan: 
What experience do you mean?  Having a sense of spiritual -- 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Well, having a sense of some experience of God. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
Right?  So I would put the likelihood this way.  If we went to a village, and there were a 
hundred people in the village, and 95 of them said that they knew a guy named Bill, and 
there were 5 percent of the guys who said, nah, and three of them thought that the 
other 95 were lying or made him up, which is more likely?  That there is a Bill and yet 95 
percent of people are hallucinating or is it that there is a Bill, and 5 percent just don't 
know the guy. 
 
20:18:59 
 
The universality of the experience -- the universality of the experience of God puts a 
heavy burden of proof on the other side to show that the mass of the human race not in 
some incidental but a central aspect of their lives.  Remember, people invest money in 
religion.  They go to church.  They leave inheritances.  They follow the credos of religion, 
that they are all hallucinating? 
 
John Donvan: 
Who said "wow"? 
 
[talking simultaneously]  



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 53 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Do you mind turning your "wow" into a question if we bring a mic to you?  You don't 
mind? 
 
Male Speaker: 
[unintelligible] 
 
John Donvan: 
Sorry?  Or, you're right, that was just your guffaw.  Okay.  All right.  I would love to 
[unintelligible].  So right behind you. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
The quick answer is that there are Bills, and we've seen Bills. 
 
John Donvan: 
Michael Shermer. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
So the that's different than an invisible God that may or may not exist. 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
And the point is when you say the experience, you mean a personal -- some internal 
perception that God exists.  And -- and the fact that something is maybe relatively 
universal suggests that we may be programmed to believe in certain things.  But it 
doesn't mean -- because that doesn't mean they exist just because as Michael was 
talking about earlier, our evolutional history programs us to have certain tendencies. 
 
20:20:16 
 
And there's no doubt -- you'd be crazy to suggest that humans don't have a tendency to 
be religious.  That would violate evidence of reality.  So the fact that humans have a 
tendency to be religious is not -- or a belief in God is not proof that God exists.  It's just 
proof that humans have a tendency. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
[applause] 
 
Female Speaker: 
Hi.  My name is Linda Drum.  My question is for this side. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 54 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
The side arguing against the motion. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Yes.  We have had many gods as civilization began.  They've been taken away as we've 
been able -- as science has been able to explain something like fire.  We had the god of 
fire, science came along and said, well, it's not really God.  You do this.  You rub two 
sticks together, we understand the process behind it, so therefore it's not a god.  It's 
science. 
 
20:21:09 
 
My question to you is this.  You keep talking about Christianity.  I understand that 
religion and God are intertwined.  But can you separate the two?  And if you can, can 
you say, why is it necessary to believe in God?  Aside from religion, why is it important 
that we believe in God? 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to pass on the question again because I don't think it moves us on this topic of 
science.  But it was actually a great question.  And makes me think we should have a 
debate on that they topic.  Ma'am, right there.  All right, yes. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Hi. 
 
John Donvan: 
Just wait for the mic, please.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot. 
 
Female Speaker: 
I'm loud, but -- if -- if you -- do you believe that your Christianity is absolute and true, or 
do you feel that you need to make a leap of faith there?  And is a leap of faith scientific? 
 
20:22:06 
 
John Donvan: 
Well done.   
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
So can I take this one at least to begin with? 
 
John Donvan: 
Ian Hutchinson. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 55 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Ian Hutchinson: 
Yes, I think faith is an important topic that we haven't touched on.  And humans make 
decisions on the basis of incomplete evidence all the time during our lives.  And it's 
people who act boldly and with determination and commitment who are the people 
who, in the end, are most successful in life.  They act on the evidence that they have, 
even though that evidence is incomplete.  And that is, as far as I can see, an explanation 
of what is -- or at least part of what is meant by faith.  Faith is that same principle of 
acting on the evidence we know, even though it's not complete, applied to matters of 
the spirit.

Dinesh D’Souza: 
If I can add a big thought to that, it is -- you ask if its scientific, and I would say no.  Faith 
is not scientific.  But faith is completely rational.  Why?  Because where empirical 
evidence can't go, it's not unreasonable to believe on faith.  Let's say, for example, 
you're making any kind of a decision, whether to invest in Brazil or whether to propose 
marriage.  You bring in all the evidence you can.  And yet if you're asking the question, 
will I make money?  Or what will life be like with this woman over the next 30 years?  
You're never going to have a full answer.  Now, you can say, "I'll be an agnostic and wait 
for the data to come in."  But the data will never come in.  She'll marry someone else, 
and you'll both be dead.  So you put in all the knowledge you can, and the leap of faith is 
a completely rational bridge from knowledge to action.

[applause] 
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
As I said, in science we talk about likely and unlikely.  In science, of course, and in life, 
we do, I agree, make decisions based on incomplete evidence.  But the wonderful thing 
about science, the thing that makes science so much better than religion is our faith is 
shakable.  I am proud of the fact that there's something I can believe with all my heart 
to be absolutely true and the minute there's a bit of evidence that shows it isn't true, I 
throw it out like yesterday's newspaper.  In fact, that's the one thing I recommend, I 
hope every student has in their experiences sometime in their life, something that they 
profoundly believe in to be true based on faith shown to be wrong because that opens 
their mind.  And that's what science does that religion doesn't.

John Donvan: 
And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Where our motion is "Science refutes God."  
 
[applause] 
 
And here's where we are.   We are about to hear brief closing statements from each 
debater in turn.  Those statements will be two minutes each.   
 
20:24:59 
 
And, remember, the audience, you voted before the debate, and this is their last chance 
to change your mind before you vote a second time to pick the winner.  On to round 
three, closing statements.  Our motion is, "Science refutes God."  And here to 
summarize his position against this motion, Ian Hutchinson, professor of nuclear science 
and engineering at MIT. 
 
[applause] 
 
Ian Hutchinson: 
Although it is incompetent to refute God or religion, science is very important.  It's our 
way of finding out about the regularities of the universe and this amazing natural world 
in which we live.  And I think both sides can agree that we deplore the widespread 
ignorance of science.  And we want Americans of all persuasions to understand science 
better. 
 
20:25:57 
 
And if you share that viewpoint, then here's why you should vote against this motion.  
Claiming more for science than is warranted by its competence does not promote 
science; it damages it.  Talking as if science is all the real knowledge there is, that -- as 
this scientistic motion does, alienates from science people who know better than to 
accept such an unjustified metaphysical extrapolation.  It alienates intellectuals, 
particularly from other nonscientific disciplines, and so gives rise to the culture wars 
that have roiled the academy for the last few decades.  And it alienates nonintellectuals 
whose opinions are more intuitive and practical but who know that their life is more 
than some reductionistic description in terms of atoms and molecules.

People who make aggressive anti-theistic claims on behalf of science are not acting as 
science's champions; they are bringing it into disrepute.  They are confusing science 
with scientism, perhaps for their own polemic purposes.  And they are in the end 
misrepresenting science to the public, and, therefore, I urge you, whatever may be your 
religious beliefs, to vote against this erroneous motion.  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Ian Hutchinson. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "science refutes God," and here to speak in support of the motion, 
Michael Shermer.  He is the founding publisher of Skeptic Magazine and a columnist for 
Scientific American. 
 
Michael Shermer: 
When I was a Christian and I matriculated at Pepperdine University, I was in what I call 
the "bubble."  I was in the bubble where everybody around you believes.  And in that 
bubble, the Christian worldview like any other worldview is internally consistent.  It's 
inherently logical.  It's reinforced by everybody around you until you step outside of the 
bubble. 
 
20:28:03 
 
What happened with me is I went to graduate school and I started to study social 
psychology, anthropology, psychology, and beliefs, and so on.  And there I realized that 
none of those arguments actually make sense in and of themselves, the arguments for 
God's existence.  What became clear to me is that what happens is, is you arrive at 
beliefs for non-rational, non-smart reasons, and then you back into it after the fact with 
rational reasons to justify it.  We call this the "confirmation bias."  And so for me I think 
there's overwhelming evidence that I've given you tonight that there's good 
anthropological social science reasons why people believe in God that, that doesn't 
prove there's a god, that it proves that we create gods in our heads.  In addition to that, 
I don't think there's any evidence to support that there actually is a god out there 
separate from our beliefs.  
 
20:28:52 
 
But finally my final point is this, is that I don't even think it's possible for there to be a 
God, at least not a supernatural God in this way, if God is supernatural, that is, outside 
of the space and time, there's no way for us to know it.  Therefore, whatever God is, it 
would have to be a natural being or at least some kind of a being that reaches in to stir 
the particles, and if he does, then we should be able to measure it, because that's what 
we do as scientists.  We measure the motions of particles.  And so far we have no 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 58 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

evidence of that.  So, therefore, I think that the most we could hope to find would be 
some kind of a natural being, in which case it would just become part of science, and 
that would be the end of the whole God concept.  So if you agree with me that the 
evidence points in that direction, that we constructed gods and not vice versa, I would 
urge you to vote on our side for the proposition that "science refutes God." 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Michael Shermer. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that is our motion, "science refutes God."  And here to summarize his position 
against the motion, Dinesh DSouza; he is the bestselling author of "What's So Great 
About Christianity?" and he is the director of "2016, Obama's America." 
 
20:29:59 
 
Dinesh DSouza: 
If science refutes God, you'd expect the one person who would know that would be 
Charles Darwin.  Charles Darwin has supplied modern atheism with perhaps the 
strongest argument against God, evolution.  And yet, when Darwin published his 
evolution theory, the Harvard botanist -- the American botanist Asa Gray wrote Darwin 
a letter in which he said, "As a Christian, I was very inspired upon reading your book, 
because I have read in the book of Genesis that God made the world and God made 
man, but there's no information about how this might've occurred.  And when I read 
your book, I understood not only why God made humans, but why there's so much 
suffering in the world.  Evolution helps to account for the reason why there's suffering 
both for humans, but also in the animal kingdom." 
 
20:30:54 
 
Darwin was so thrilled at receiving this letter that he published it in future editions of 
"The Origin of Species."  So, in other words, for Darwin, what actually caused him to lose 
his own faith, which he did, had nothing to do with evolution.  According to Darwin's 
biographers, and there are many of them, Darwin lost his faith because he lost one of 
his daughters, Annie.  It was a terrible, unexpected death, and Darwin blamed God for it 
and turned against God.  It was the issue of suffering, not science, that turned Darwin 
against God. 
 
Now, we're debating here has science refuted God?  And at some senses, we've been 
talking past each other.  If I take a pot of water and put it on the stove, what am I trying 
to do?  I'm trying to make a cup of tea.  Now, Lawrence Krauss would come along and 
say that the molecules are heating up, he could give a full scientific account of what's 
going on, but he would've completely missed the purpose behind what I'm doing.  The

scientific explanation doesn't refute the purposeful explanation, it coexists alongside it, 
and so it is with God.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Dinesh DSouza.  "Science refutes God" is our motion, and here to 
summarize his position in support of this motion, Lawrence Krauss.  He is a theoretical 
physicist and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University.  
 
Lawrence Krauss: 
Human beings were clearly programmed by evolution to impute intentionality to the 
world around them.  Meaning and purpose was infused in all everyday events to make 
sense of a dangerous, difficult, and uncaring world, so we had rituals behind the sun, the 
moon, the planets, the wind, the earth, the oceans, in all societies.  The rise of our 
physical understanding has slowly caused us to do away with those many gods; we no 
longer have Mars, the god of war, Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, Thor, the god of 
storms.  As Michael has said, everyone here, or maybe everyone, is now an atheist with 
respect to those gods, and there's a reason for that.  Science has taught us that instead 
of capricious beings, there's an order to nature, and that order does not appear to 
involve a divinity. 
 
20:32:59 
 
There's no need for a divinity; laws of nature describable bymathematics make 
predictions that allow us to -- not only to predict the future, but control it, without the 
need for any supernatural shenanigans.  And, in fact, it amazes me that asking the 
question, "Is God necessary?" is somehow an evil thing.  When we stop asking 
questions, that will be an evil thing.  Science has taught us also that we want to believe, 
in the words of Fox Mulder. 
 
[laughter] 
 
And we should be skeptical of those desires.  As the physicist Richard Feynman told us, 
the easiest people to fool are ourselves.  As scientist, we have to train ourselves to be 
skeptical of wanting to believe.  And we should try and overcome our natural tendency 
to assume special significance to events.  And human being are also inevitably 
programmed to ask, "Why?" as we've heard it.  But the "Why?" question is ill-posed, 
because it presumes purpose; it presumes the answer to the question before you ask 
the question.  
 
20:33:56 
 
What if there is no purpose?  Does there need to be purpose?  And science tells us 
there's no evidence of purpose.  So the "Why?" question is ill-posed.  Our opponents 
want to keep the clock from ticking by avoiding the evidence of reality; and, therefore, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 60 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

science, by telling us there's no need for purpose, has refuted the need for God, and 
that's why you should support our position. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Lawrence Krauss.  And that concludes our closing statements.  
 
[applause] 
 
And now it's time for you to judge which team has voted -- now it's time for you to 
judge which team has argued best.  We're asking you, again, to go to the key pads at 
your seat that registered your vote, as it did at the beginning.  And we're doing to get 
the read out almost instantaneously.  As before, if you are with the motion, for the 
motion, push number one.  If you're against, push number two.  And if you're 
undecided, or became undecided, or remain undecided, push number three. 
 
20:35:04 
 
And we'll keep the voting open for about another 20 seconds, everybody okay with 
that?  Okay, we're going to lock out the voting.  Oh, wait, I got somebody -- somebody's 
still working on it.  Indecision is a terrible thing.  We're good?  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  All 
right, first of all -- first of all, I want to thank this panel of debaters for being so 
energetic, honest, intelligent.  They brought it all.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
20:36:01 
 
I also want to thank everyone who asked a question.  The questions were really terrific 
tonight.  Also, the folks who asked questions and I didn't take them, there's no dishonor 
in that; I appreciate that you had the courage to get up and do this, so thank you to 
everybody who got up and asked a question today.  The people who have been 
tweeting, you can keep going.  If you want to tweet afterwards, our twitter handle is 
@IQ2US and the hashtag for this event is #scivgod, that's S-C-I-V -- as in versus -- God, 
all in one word.  So to everybody who enjoyed themselves, we want you to know that 
we do this every month and it's always this good, although we do all different kinds of 
topics, but we get very, very smart people up here on the stage to do this, to engage, 
really, to pay each other the respect of listening to each other's arguments, if only to 
demolish them, but they do it, they listen.  They listen and that' a rare thing, and it lets 
you have the opportunity of really hearing two sides well-articulated.

So want to talk a little bit, very briefly, about next season.  We're going to be back here 
at the Kaufmann Theater, we'll be debating nuclear Iran; genetic engineering; America's 
dollar policy, whether we need a strong dollar or not; the future of the Republican 
Party; and the Food and Drug Administration, where we're going to be looking at the 
issue of whether the rules that are in place for safety are actually hazardous to the 
health of Americans.  Our first debate is coming up on Wednesday, January 16th.  The 
motion that we're going with is "Israel can live with a nuclear Iran."  In support of that 
motion, James Dobbins; he's a former assistant secretary of state and a special envoy in 
the Clinton and Bush administrations; he's now a director at RAND.  His partner will be 
Reuben [unintelligible]; he's a senior military affairs analyst for Haaretz, the Israeli 
newspaper; he was also once a fighter pilot in the Israeli air force. 
 
20:38:00 
 
Against the motion [unintelligible]; he's the director of studies at the Institute for Policy 
and Strategy and a former Israeli intelligence officer.  His partner is Jeffrey Goldberg, the 
award-winning journalist and national correspondent for the Atlantic.  All journalists 
appear to be award-winning -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Said the three-time Emmy award winning -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
If you can't -- if you can't be in the audience for that, as you know from your 
participation tonight, there are a lot of ways that people out there can watch us, and 
you can, too.  You can watch the live stream on FORA.tv or listen to the debates on NPR, 
here in New York City that's on WNYC.  And you can also watch them on WNET, the 
world digital channel, starting in January, on PBS stations across the nation. 
 
20:38:45 
 
Okay.  The results are coming in now.  Okay.  I just needed to digest. And I want to put 
my glasses on for this.  Okay.  So it's all in, I have been given the results.  Remember, the 
team that changes the most minds is declared the victor.  And here it is: before the 
debate, 37 percent agreed with the motion, 34 percent were against, and 29 percent 
were undecided.  So those are the first results.  Remember, the team that has the 
highest percentage change is declared the winner.  In the second vote, let's go first to 
the team that was arguing for the motion.  Their number went from 37 percent to 50 
percent.  
 
[applause] 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 62 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

That's a 13 percent increase.  So the team arguing against the motion has to do better 
than 13 percent.  Let's see how they did.  Before the vote, 34 percent, the second vote, 
38 percent, that's up 4 percent.  It's not enough.  The team arguing for the motion, 
"science refutes God," has won the debate.
