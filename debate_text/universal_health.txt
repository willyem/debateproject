JOHN DONVAN 

I want to thank you all very, very much for making it out this 

evening and for making this a sellout, the first night of the new 

series.  And I would like to turn it over to Chris Browne of 

Rockefeller University.   

CHRISTOPHER BROWNE 

Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  I’m Chris Browne, I’m a 

member of the Board of Trustees here at The Rockefeller 

University.  A universally world-renowned center for research in 

the biomedical and biological sciences.  I’m also a supporter of 

Intelligence Squared US and a long-time friend of its chairman, 

Bob Rosenkranz.   We’ve known each other for so long that I 

won’t admit how long.  But it’s been a while.  It’s a special

pleasure for me to welcome you this evening, in which two 

organizations I admire are working together.  Rockefeller is 

providing the new and larger venue, enabling Intelligence 

Squared to better meet the demand for the elevated public 

discourse it supplies.  Bob Rosenkranz will now be joining us, via 

videotape, to frame tonight’s discussion.   

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Thank you, and welcome.  [PAUSE, LAUGHTER]  In the upcoming 

political campaign, we’re going to hear an awful lot about health 

care.  The 45 million uninsured, are cited as a national scandal.  

And the efficiency of our current system is very questionable.   

Our current health care system, consumes about 50 to 100 

percent bigger piece of our national output, than health care in 

other rich countries, with very, very little to show for it, in the 

way of improved outcomes.  Those who favor a federally 

mandated universal coverage, argue that, it will produce greater 

efficiency, as the federal government drives private-sector costs 

down.   It’ll promote better health outcomes, as we are able to 

have more early intervention, and more preventive medicine, and 

it’s more fair to the disadvantaged people in our society who are 

not getting the full benefits of, of health care coverage that our 

country can provide.    

 

On the other side of the argument, are those that rarely link the

terms “efficient” and “government” in the same sentence.  They 

see the problem as grossly exaggerated.  Of the 45 million 

uninsured, many are young people who are relatively healthy, 

people who can easily afford medical coverage but elect not to 

buy insurance, illegal immigrants, and people who are eligible for 

Medicaid but have not enrolled.   They think that the 

inefficiencies in the system, are caused by the fact that most 

consumers of medical care don’t pay for the service directly, and 

therefore, have no incentive to control costs.  And finally on the 

subject of fairness, universal care may be seen as simply a way of 

compelling healthy young people, to subsidize the cost of 

providing health care to their less healthy elders.   To discuss 

these very timely matters we have a truly outstanding panel with 

us tonight, and it’s my real pleasure to introduced John Donvan, 

our new moderator, and the radio voice of Intelligence Squared, 

on the 150 National Public Radio stations that carry these 

debates.   John is an Emmy Award-winning journalist, with 20 

years at ABC News, most recently at Nightline.  He’s been a White 

House correspondent, and a foreign correspondent, in Moscow, 

Jerusalem, Amman, Iraq.  John, the evening is yours.

Thank you, Robert Rosenkranz.  [APPLAUSE]  And I would also 

like to invite a round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz whose 

vision makes these evenings possible, normally he’s here in

person but—  [APPLAUSE]  I am John Donvan, your host and 

moderator, for Intelligence Squared US, I am with ABC News 

Nightline but tonight it is a pleasure to be introducing and 

moderating these debates, Intelligence Squared US, Oxford-style 

debating on America’s shores, the motion for tonight’s debate as 

you know, “Universal health coverage should be the federal 

government’s responsibility.”   You are going to be hearing from 

six panelists throughout the program, three who are for this 

motion, and three of whom are against, we’re going to have a 

three-part debate, the first part, the most substantial part in a 

certain way will be opening statements, each of the speakers in 

turn will be given seven minutes to make the case, I want to clue 

you in there is a sound that you will hear at the six-minute mark, 

it’s a warning sound telling them that they’re running out of time 

and it sounds like—  [WARNING SOUND]    

 

Very gentle sound, and—  [LAUGHTER]  It can become more 

insistent and at the seven-minute mark it will become rather 

relentless like this.  [WARNING SOUND REPEATS, LAUGHTER]  

All righty.  All righty.  [LAUGHTER]  We’re going to poll you both 

before and after the debate because, the point here, is to win the 

room.  These debaters are trying to persuade you to their point of 

view, everyone comes in here with a point of view or the absence 

of a point of view known as undecided.   We’re going to poll you to

find out what our baseline is coming in but this is in a sense a 

contest, it’s not quite a reality show but it is a contest, it’s a 

contest of wits and facts and information and persuasion, and all 

of you are the umpires, you are the referees, you are the judges 

in this.    

 

We will also, later in the program, after the opening statements, 

we’ll be coming to you for questions, and then the evening 

concludes with each of the debaters taking two minutes to sum 

up and reach a summary position, at that point we will vote 

again, to find out how they did, who were the winners of the 

evening.   So, once again the topic, to reiterate, “Universal health 

coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility,” if 

you go to the keypads attached to your seats at this 

point…number 1 means that you are for the motion, number 2, 

you are against the motion, number 3, you at this point are 

undecided.  Please vote.   

[PAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Does anyone need more time?  It was pretty simple.  [PAUSE]  So 

in a short time we’ll have the results to share with you but we 

want to begin now, with the opening statements, once again our 

topic, “Universal health coverage should be the federal 

government’s responsibility,” and arguing first for the motion,

Paul Krugman, a well-known op-ed columnist for the New York 

Times and I want to point out that in an era when many of us 

were beginning to refer to our potatoes as Freedom Fries, Paul 

Krugman stood up and talked about the French when it comes to 

health care, in some ways, doing it better than the United States, 

and the Germans, and the Koreans…Paul Krugman, the podium 

is yours.   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

Thank you.  So I’m an economist which means I’m supposed to 

talk about efficiency, but I actually want to start, by talking about 

morality.  And in fact I don’t want to start by talking about health 

care.  Let me talk about something that’s going on right now.   As 

we sit here there are several million people in the Houston 

metropolitan area, who are without electricity or running water.  

Been hit by disaster, they didn’t do anything wrong.  They stayed 

in their houses because that was what they were advised by the 

governor of Texas to do, it was the right thing to do given the 

impossibility of evacuating a city that size and now, a lot of them 

are in trouble.    

 

Some of them can manage, some of them can now go and stay 

with relatives, some are in good health and, others are not, 

they’re in a lot of trouble.  Now, do we think that the people who 

are in trouble, who are elderly, who are in poor health, who just 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

don’t have the financial resources, whatever, to get themselves 

out of that situation, do we believe that, well look, you know, it’s 

not a government responsibility to help them, they should be left 

on their own.  Well of course we don’t, I mean, I imagine there are 

some people who do believe that, but not many.  They certainly 

don’t show their heads in our American politics.  We do believe 

that if our fellow citizens suffer misfortune that is no fault of their 

own, and we can help them, that we should.   

 

Now imagine, some American who is in poor health and can’t 

afford medical care.  Some American who is elderly and in need, 

trouble, or maybe not elderly, something’s gone wrong, someone 

who is trying to work but can’t get a job that has health 

insurance, someone who is in difficulty.   Do we believe that 

that’s their problem, that we should not be taking care of them.  

And by the way, we’re not just talking about the 45 million 

without health insurance.  We’re also talking about the roughly 

75 million people who have inadequate health insurance.   Health 

insurance that basically crumples, whenever it’s put to the need, 

we’re talking about a large part of this country, that does not 

have adequate health care coverage.   

 

Well I would submit to you that actually as a nation, we don’t 

believe that it’s appropriate to leave these people on their own.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Universal Health Coverage

That we actually believe that the right thing to do is to help 

people, we don’t think that people should be protected from all of 

the risks of life but when there is something you can do, we 

believe that we should do it.   And in fact by and large, if you ask 

people, should people have health coverage in this country, 

should people be guaranteed health care, most polls I’ve seen say 

that a heavy majority of the public thinks that they should.  So 

then the question would be, well how is it that we don’t actually 

have that, how is it that we haven’t actually taken care of our 

citizens in the way that overwhelmingly, as a nation, we believe is 

the morally right thing to do, that as a matter of values, we think 

we oughta do.   And the answer is of course that we’re told…well 

actually we’re told two things.  We’re told first of all, that we 

already do it.  That we already take care of everybody, and we’re 

also told, that it’s impossible to take care of everybody.   

 

Now you might think that it was impossible to believe both those 

things at the same time but, that’s why these guys are paid the 

big bucks.  So we’re told that, well, look—  And I can quote the 

President there.  “I mean people have got access to health care in 

America.  After all you just go to an emergency room.”   And of 

course--I think we probably have a fair number of doctors here 

right--you know, it ain’t the same thing.  First of all, going into 

emergency is no substitute for continuing care.   And secondly, if

                                           Should Be the Federal Government’s Responsibility” (9/16/08) Page 9. 

 

 

 

you go to an emergency room, they will bill you.  Now if you’re 

indigent, we’ve got the care all the same but you will get the bill 

and if you’re indigent maybe that doesn’t matter, but, for working 

Americans who don’t have good incomes, they’re terrified of 

emergency room coverage, and it’s—there’s something sick about 

our debate, that anybody can even claim that the emergency 

room is a substitute for universal health care.   

 

But the other argument is that it’s impossible.  That if you try to 

have some form of universal health care, it’ll be terrible.  It’ll be 

lousy quality, it’ll be wildly expensive.  So people are told that a 

government insurance system can’t possibly work.   It will be 

lousy insurance, it’ll be awful, it’ll lead to awful care…  Which, 

now we’re going to hear a little bit I think later on about some of 

the international evidence, we’re going to hear about other 

countries.   But you know, I—there’s a secret, I don’t know if 

people know about it but you know, there’s this program called 

Medicare.  Covers every American 65 and older.  It is, horrors, it’s 

a single-payer health insurance system run by the federal 

government.   When it was being proposed, people said it would 

be terrible.  You may have heard of something called Operation 

Kaffeeklatsch.    

 

Or you may not have heard of it.  Doctors’ wives were urged to

hold kaffeeklatsches, in which they would try to convince the 

doctors’ patients what a terrible idea this proposal called 

Medicare was, and they would play a recording by a fellow named 

Ronald Reagan, explaining what a terrible idea Medicare was and 

how it would lead, not only to destruction of health care, but 

actually the destruction of freedom, it’s quite something, you can 

listen to it online and, at the end, it basically says Medicare is the 

root to a totalitarian state.   Well, it’s become as American as 

apple pie.  Famous quote among, in the health care field is the, 

constituent who accosted Senator John Breaux saying, Senator, 

don’t let the government get its hands on Medicare.    

 

The fact of the matter is we have universal health coverage for 

our elderly already.  The other thing that people say is that it 

would be impossibly expensive.  Now, the truth is, a little-known 

other big secret, really have to go in deep research and actually 

look at a couple of official statistics that are easily available to 

find this out—  In this country, the government already pays 

more health care bills than private insurers do.  Medicare and 

Medicaid together, are already a bigger program than private 

insurance, all [WARNING BELL] private health insurance.  The 

reason is that we already cover the expensive cases.  We already 

have the expensive cases.  The elderly, the very sick who end up 

being bankrupted and therefore end up poor enough to get

Medicaid are covered by public programs.  What’s left, are 

generally lower-income working adults, and we pay an enormous 

amount to not cover them.   The fact of the matter is that our 

health care system is wildly inefficient, largely because we have 

an insurance industry that devotes enormous resources to try to 

identify who really needs health insurance, so as not to give it to 

them.    

 

And we have health care providers devoting enormous resources, 

fighting with the insurance companies, to actually get paid.  And 

the result is a wildly inefficient system.  It would be cheaper, by 

far, to just cover everybody.  We pay this huge price because 

we’ve managed to convince ourselves, or be convinced, that 

somehow, something that [WARNING BELL, REPEATING] every 

other advanced country does, and that every other—that we do 

ourselves for the elderly, is impossible.  Thank you—    

JOHN DONVAN  

Paul Krugman, thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  Pretty well-

timed actually.  Speaking against the motion, John Stossel, my 

colleague from ABC News, but we did not discuss this ahead of 

time, in fact, though both of us have worked a quarter-century at 

ABC News we’ve never met until tonight.  [LAUGHTER]   Bizarrely 

enough, separate orbits I suppose.  I kept my feet on the ground.  

John Stossel’s hard-nosed take on many a liberal policy

assumption is summed up in his catch-phrase, “Gimme a break.”  

Tonight in a sense we’re discussing, what if you break your arm, 

or your neck…should the federal government be there to provide 

your insurance safety net, John Stossel, here to argue against 

that idea and the motion tonight.   

JOHN STOSSEL 

It is intuitive to think that it should, that we have…very poor and 

helpless people and it’s the job of government, to help them, and, 

actually we have that, we have Medicaid.  If you are poor, you are 

covered in America.  It’s not a good system.  It’s tempting to think 

that a wise government could step in.   Paul Krugman has just 

said look at Medicare, people like Medicare.  And that’s true.  

But, of course they like it, because, it gives you stuff free.  People 

like that.  But it’s unsustainable, it’s $35 trillion in the hole.  

That’s the unfounded liability of Medicare.    

 

They made promises to cover us when we’re 75, when the panel 

is 75, there’s no way they can possibly do that.  Right now it’s 

working, because there are lots of young people and relatively few 

older people, but there’s just no way it can be sustained, if a 

private company tried to run its pension system that way I bet 

they’d throw the owners in jail.  It’s a Ponzi scheme.   Now, some 

people will talk tonight about the widely publicized data that 

America spends the most on health care, and we do, and studies

have found that we have the worst result.  But those studies are 

deceitful.  They compare us by how long we live.  But Americans 

are different.   We drive cars more.  We kill each other more often.  

Our accident rate, deaths on the highways triple that of the 

United Kingdom, we murder each other 10 times as often as the 

United Kingdom.   

 

When you take that out, we live longer than those other 

countries.  [LAUGHTER]  And that doesn’t even include, diet 

issues, because we eat more and that kills people.  A lot of these 

studies are skewed to make America look bad.  Now many people 

say that the perfect system is in Europe where you have 

universal health care, and it’s true—most other countries do have 

systems like that.  And it gets rid of the horrible anxiety that 

some people have in America, will I be covered.  And that is 

horrible, and that does make people sick.   But it’s better to be 

anxious, than to be in horrible pain.  Or to be dead.  And these 

universal coverage systems, they don’t guarantee universal 

access to actual care.  In Canada, more than a million families 

can’t get a doctor.   We taped in one town in Ontario where they 

have a lottery, they have a little box, everybody puts the family 

name in and, the town clerk pulls out a name, oh, you get to see 

a doctor this week.  There aren’t enough doctors to go around, in 

Britain, one in eight patients waits more than a year for

treatment in a hospital.    

 

The journal Clinical Oncology says 20 percent of potentially 

curable lung cancer patients, become incurable on the waiting 

list.  Now why does this happen, well, because when everything is 

free, when the government pays for it…everybody wants 

everything.  But the government doesn’t have infinite money so 

the government then must ration.   And they do it by not giving 

you the latest, most expensive stuff, or they make you wait in 

line.  In one town in England they opened a, a new office where 

you could get dental treatment, people lined up for blocks.  Now 

most of them didn’t get in, so people pull their own teeth.  The 

dental tools are pliers and vodka.  This is not a good way to live.   

 

Still, despite the fact they spend less, European care is not 

remarkably inferior, it’s pretty good for most people.  But that’s 

true only because they freeload off of us.  Because most of the 

innovation comes from America.  From the greedy profit-driven 

companies that want to take as much money from you as they 

possibly can, they’re the ones who gave us so much good stuff, 

the MRI’s, the CT scans.   ACE inhibitors to lower blood pressure.  

The statins like Lipitor, to reduce cholesterol, coronary bypass 

surgery, hip replacement, knee replacement.  What will the world 

be like if we have universal care and we don’t have America to

invent those things?   Yes, the private market is awful in many 

ways and wasteful.  Health insurance companies waste all this 

money on advertising, paperwork, duplication, claims officers 

trying to make sure you’re not cheating ‘em.  It is intuitive to 

think a single payer would be more efficient.  And Michael 

Rachlis who will speak shortly has written that, a public 

bureaucracy is cheaper.    

 

And, I used to believe that, when I attended Paul Krugman’s 

university I was taught that, that the wise elites in Washington 

and state capitol can plan these things better than these 

competing companies.  But then I became a consumer reporter, 

and I watched the market work.   I watched government and 

private greedy companies trying to deliver services to people.  And 

now I say that’s nonsense, government can’t do anything even 

close to the efficient way that private companies do it.  When 

government pays for things, people don’t change, they don’t 

innovate, they keep doing the same thing they did to get paid.   

So, as an example look at the inefficiency of the private car 

companies.  They waste millions in advertising on my program, 

I’m glad they do.  And they run these gross ads, they sell cars not 

based on their engineering perfection or safety, they sell sex and 

muscle cars.   They have these competing dealerships and pushy 

salesmen selling things like rust-proofing that we don’t need.

Despite all of that, what’s the worst you get when you buy a car 

[WARNING BELL] in New York?  The worst you can get, is better 

than this, this is what the planned economies…universal 

coverage gives us, and I apologize to those of you on the radio, 

you can’t see I’m holding up a picture of the Trabant, that East 

German car.  [LAUGHTER]  This was the best those brilliant East 

German engineers could produce, it was an awful car, you had to 

put the oil and gas separately and shake the car to mix ‘em 

together.  [LAUGHTER]   As soon as the Berlin Wall went down, 

this disappeared, because it couldn’t compete with the mediocre 

products that produced—were produced by our competing 

companies.  I don’t want to have this kind of health care, and 

that’s what we’ll get if government runs it, at the beginning, 

government could do things well, you get the Peace Corps, New 

York’s public schools.  But after a while it deteriorates because 

they don’t change, they don’t improve, maybe once every 12 years 

they change a little.  If we have [WARNING BELL, REPEATING] 

universal health care, this is what we’ll get.

universal coverage is the solution or why universal coverage is 

the problem, we are pleased to have Michael Rachlis standing at 

our podium to argue for the motion, “Universal health coverage 

should be the federal government’s responsibility,” Michael.   

MICHAEL RACHLIS 

Thank you very much, John.  And I’d like to thank the 

Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared very much for 

inviting me to New York, I’ve had a wonderful time while I’ve been 

here.  I also have a strong personal connection to the United 

States, my wife is an American and I visit her family on a regular 

basis and see the great health care that the United States has, 

and the terrible health care that this country has.   And one is 

given to her father and one is given to her uncle, and the 

difference is insurance coverage.  I’ve also slept overnight, I don’t 

want to give the impression I sleep around but, I’ve slept 

overnight in 23 US states and I have a pretty good idea of the 

health care system in this country as even my daughter has used 

it when she had a catfish spine through her palm in Florida.   

 

Now, as Paul has said, that this is very much a question of 

values.  And it’s actually a case where you can have your cake

and eat it too, in fact, you can only eat your cake if you have it, in 

other words, you can only get cost control if you—if you have 

equity.  And as Paul has said, as we’ve heard others say, the US 

system costs the most in the world, it denies care to tens of 

millions of Americans and I have seen that personally.  And the 

international performance and quality is just so-so.  Does this 

really reflect American values.  Is this really what you want out of 

your health care system.  In Canada, our values for health care 

go back to Tommy Douglas, the premier of Saskatchewan 

between 1944 and 1961.   And when Tommy was a boy in my 

hometown of Winnipeg, Manitoba, he developed osteomyalitis, an 

infection in his leg.  There were no antibiotics at the time, the 

recommendation of the doctors were that his leg should be 

amputated.   

 

Fortunately Dr. Robert Smith, a noted surgeon, saw Douglas, told 

him that because he was an interesting case, he would treat him 

for free if he allowed teaching students to--allowed Dr. Smith to 

teach with him.  Douglas was left with the impression all his life 

if he hadn’t been fortunate enough to run into Dr. Smith and be 

interesting, he would’ve lost his leg.   Then a few years later, after 

Douglas’s government in Saskatchewan had implemented 

universal hospital insurance and universal medical insurance, 

despite the fact that in the 1940s being the poorest province in

Canada,  Justice Emmett Hall, a Supreme Court justice in 

Canada, and if anything a conservative, was asked by our then-

Prime Minister, John George Diefenbaker, to review our health 

care system.  His conclusion, was that we should move ahead 

with medical insurance ‘cause we already had hospital 

insurance.   The main reason he gave was, efficiency.  He said 

that it would be a lot cheaper to have a single-payer system, than 

to have multiple private payers.  And so his vote was for 

efficiency.  And those are the values on which our system are [sic] 

based.  Equity and efficiency.   

 

What are the results?  Fifty years ago we had the same as your 

country.  We had the same health status.  We paid the same 

amount for health care.  Fifty years later, all Canadians are 

covered for hospitals and physicians service.  In the United 

States millions have no coverage, and tens of millions have, have 

inadequate insurance.  We actually get more of most services 

than Americans do.  We have more visits to doctors every year, 

more days in hospital, more days in nursing homes, we take 

more prescription drugs than you do.  I mean, not all of these 

things are good, too much health care can kill you. [LAUGHTER]  

But even though there are some services we don’t get as much of, 

like nobody in the world does as much cardiac interventions as 

you do, the Belgians are close, but nobody really else is close, we

actually do more bone marrow transplants.  We do more lung 

transplant surgery.  Toronto is an international center for lung 

transplants.  And that, far from lacking innovation, we’re the 

country that brought you insulin, we developed bone marrow 

transplantation.  When Paul Tsongas was telling the electorate 

years ago that he wouldn't have got his service in Canada, it 

greatly offended the two people, two doctors in Toronto who had 

developed the procedure. And all of this costs way less, ten 

percent of our GDP compared to sixteen percent in your country.  

How does that happen?  Well, half of the extra expense is 

administration, because of the extra expense of this multiple 

payer system.  The other half is due to higher prices because you 

don’t have effective cost control because you don’t have a single 

payer.  Now, this must cost us a fortune, we must be basket 

cases.  The Canadian Federal Government has run surpluses 

equal to one to two percent of our GDP for eleven years in a row.  

There’s no problem affording health care when you do it because 

you're concerned about other people.  Then you can make it 

affordable.  And our health status, of course, is not a true 

reflection, but in other, but from what you’ll hear, perhaps, from 

these panelists and others, you’d imagine Canadians are dying in 

the street waiting for medical care.  In fact, we now live three 

years longer on average than you do.  This is over a fifty year 

period, we’ve now got a three year longer life expectancy.  Our

infant mortality rates are twenty to thirty percent lower than 

yours.  And finally, it’s a great boon to business in our country.  

The province of Ontario has, the last couple of years, has been 

assembling more motor vehicles than any US state including 

Michigan.  The costs to manufacturers are nine percent of payroll 

for health care costs in this country, one and a half percent in 

Canada.  That our manufacturing center is under pressure, but it 

would be gone without our health care system.   So, Canada has 

done well, but Canada is not the outlier.  Canada is the outlier in 

North America.  Around the world wealthy countries, all wealthy 

countries that Americans would think of when they think of other 

countries they could live in, with a comparable standard of living, 

all other countries have a mainly public system.  And Canada 

does have problems in its system, just as every country has its 

problems.  Our problems are second order problems.  We’ve dealt 

with coverage, and we’ve mainly dealt with affordability.  So we, 

we have waits and delays in Canada, they're improving, but we 

do have them.  But France and Germany have much shorter 

waits for care than you do in this country.  So, despite the 

individual anecdotes that you're going to hear, health care in 

Canada or Germany or France are remarkably similar to the US.

New York reported on his heart attack in Toronto while he was

the ambulance.   So, let’s get serious.  Health care is pretty 

standard in most developed countries, we have similar problems 

in delivery, you are the only ones that really have problems with 

coverage and affordability.  So, it comes back to values.  If you 

focus on equity, you get a bonus.  You get cost control.  If you 

focus on cost control, you don’t get equity or cost control.  And I

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you Michael Rachlis.  I am John Donvan, and this is 

Intelligence Squared US, Oxford-style debating.  We have six 

panelists for and against the motion.  The motion in this debate 

is, “Universal health coverage should be the federal government’s 

responsibility.”  We are halfway through the opening statements 

at this point, halfway to our Q&A section, but I’d now like to 

introduce, arguing against the motion, Sally Pipes, author of The 

Top Ten Myths of American Health Care: A Citizen’s Guide.  She is 

president and chief executive officer of the Pacific Research 

Institute, a think tank based in California.   She also comes from 

Canada, but not only does she argue against this motion, two 

years ago she completed a personal journey and became a citizen 

of the United States.  Sally Pipes.

And I'm still Canadian, and proud of it.  I am against the

proposition that universal coverage should be the responsibility 

of the federal government.  I do think that everyone here would 

agree that the key goal for America is affordable, accessible, 

quality health care.  The question is, how do we achieve that 

goal?  There are two competing visions for health care reform in 

this country today, and also for achieving universal coverage.  

One focuses on government, mandates, and taxes, while the 

other focuses on free markets, innovation, and empowering 

consumers.  Today that government vision is on the rise.  The 

long term goal of most liberals is a Canadian-style, single payer, 

Medicare for all, health care system.  These liberals tell us that 

socialized systems like those in Canada and Europe are better 

and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all of us.  

They also site, as Michael did, life expectancy and infant 

mortality as evidence of the superiority of these systems.  Well, 

let’s look at life expectancy.  People who make this claim usually 

note that life expectancy is higher in Canada and Europe.  The 

World Health Organization ranking does not measure, though, 

the quality of a health care system.  The World Health 

Organization ranks systems that treat people equally higher than 

those that treat people well.  Now let’s look at infant mortality.  

The US does have a higher infant mortality rate than Canada, 

hence their government system is rated better.  The reality is that 

the United States, with its superior neo-natal care facilities, has 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Universal Health Coverage

allowed more high risk babies to live.  But this also pushes the 

infant mortality rate higher because of a greater number of at 

risk births, babies being born.  And in other countries many of 

those at risk babies do not live and are not counted in infant 

mortality statistics.  Earlier this year, a woman in Calgary was 

expecting quadruplets, there wasn’t a single neo-natal unit for 

that woman to deliver her babies.  She was airlifted to Great 

Falls, Montana, a city of fifty-five thousand, where she 

successfully delivered her quads.  I'm from Vancouver, Canada, I 

was home three years ago visiting my mom, and the front page 

story in the Vancouver Sun was, “Pregnant Mother with Twins 

Airlifted to Edmonton, Alberta.”  When they came back, the 

husband, in the interview, on the front page of the Sun said, the 

Canadian Health Care System is that of a third world country.  

Now let’s look at adult cancer survival rates.  A study published 

in the August, August issue of the British Journal Lancet 

Oncology said that America is much better at treating cancer 

than Europe or Canada.  Researchers found that Americans have 

a better survival rate for thirteen of the sixteen most prominent 

cancers.  For example, breast cancer survival rate among 

American women is eighty-three point five percent, whereas in 

Britain, seventy percent.  American men and women are thirty-

five percent more likely to survive colon cancer than their British 

counterparts.  Now, I have discussed the data, but let’s look at

the reality of universal coverage systems in Canada and Europe.  

Michael Moore, in his movie Sicko, where I have a cameo 

appearance, points to the wonderful health care systems in 

Canada, France, England, and Cuba, and he says they're all free.  

The US does spend, as has been pointed out, sixteen percent of 

its gross domestic product on health care, while Canada spends 

on the range of ten to eleven percent.  The reason that Canada 

spends ten to eleven percent is because the government sets a 

global budget and says, that’s what we’re spending.  And what is 

the result?  Long waiting lists for care, rationed care, and a lack 

of access to the latest technological equipment.  Today in Canada 

there are eight hundred and twenty-seven thousand Canadians 

waiting on a waiting list for procedures.  There are three point 

two million, or ten percent of our population, waiting to get a 

primary care doctor.  The average wait in 2007 from seeing a 

primary car doctor to getting treatment by a specialist was 

eighteen point three weeks.  That’s over four months.  Canada 

ranks thirteenth out of twenty-four OECD countries in MRI’s, and 

eighteenth out of twenty-four in CT scans.  When I turned fifty, I 

know it’s hard to believe that I turned fifty, but I did, my doctor 

in San Francisco said, you have to have a colonoscopy.  And I 

said, well, there’s nothing wrong with me, I don’t need a 

colonoscopy.  Well anyway, I had one.  But my mother in 

Vancouver, Canada, three years ago, July, started feeling ill and 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

was convinced she had colon cancer.  But her doctor kept saying, 

you're old, there’s nothing wrong with you, go to bed, sleep more.  

Finally in December my mom started hemorrhaging from her 

colon.  Her doctor said, you have to go to the hospital in an 

ambulance to get service in the emergency room--I could not take 

her.  After being in the emergency room for a number of hours 

she was then transferred to the transit lounge where she waited 

for two days to get a bed in a room.  But she was not counted as 

waiting in an emergency room because she was in a transit 

lounge.  The issue is that she was too old, it was decided by the 

health care system, to have a colonoscopy, when she was 

convinced that she was ill.  And what about people with 

government coverage wait and wait in socialized systems, except 

the politicians.  Belinda Stronach, former Canadian MP, opposed 

any privatization of Canadian health care.  And yet, when she 

was diagnosed with breast cancer in June of 2007, on the advice 

of her doctor, she flew to UCLA and had her breast surgery and 

paid for it herself.  As my friend in Vancouver, Dr. Brian Day, 

orthopedic surgeon, and head of the CMA, Canadian Medical 

Association, told the New York Times, Canada is a country in 

which your dog can get a hip replacement in under a week, and 

in which humans wait two to three years.  Is this the kind of 

government run health care system Americans desire?  Think 

about the post office.  Think about the DMV and the handling of

Katrina.  A majority of Americans rate the quality of our, our 

system as excellent, or good.  In Canada, according to Decima, 

only thirty-three percent rate the system as a grade A or B, and 

twenty-two percent say it’s failing.  Canadians intuitively know 

that long waits are the outcomes of government run systems.  

While we can no longer deny there are problems in health care, 

markets, consumer choice, and innovation will solve them, rather 

than putting the government in charge.

emergency medicine at Emory.  And given that, as we know, so 

often the solution that the uninsured come to when they need 

medical care is to go to an emergency room, and it’s extremely 

valuable to us to have on the panel somebody who is at the 

receiving end of that process.  I give you Art Kellermann.   

ART KELLERMANN 

Thank you.  Actually, I'm not a surgeon, I am just an ER doc, and 

I don’t have the distinguished background of my fellow panelists, 

but I have treated thousands of patients, insured and uninsured,

and I’ve also broken bad news to hundreds of families.  I want to 

tell you about one of them that I’ll never forget.  It took them two 

hours to reach Atlanta from the north Georgia mountains.  I 

faced them across the outstretched body of their son.  The 

ventilator hissed rhythmically, ten breaths per minute.  I spoke 

first.  Your son was in a terrible crash, I said.  The ambulance 

crew could tell he was severely injured and called a helicopter.  

He reached us about three hours ago.  He has several injuries, a 

collapsed lung, internal bleeding, but these aren't his most 

serious problem.  His brain injury worries us the most.  That’s 

when his mother interrupted me.  She said, doctor, I don't know 

how to ask you this, but I must.  My husband lost his job six 

weeks ago, I work, but my employer doesn't offer health 

insurance.  Is my son going to get the care he needs?  

Momentarily taken aback, I replied, ma'am, you're at Grady 

Hospital, one of the finest trauma centers in the south, I swear to 

you, we will do everything in our power to save your son.  I meant 

what I said that night, but I didn't tell her the whole truth.  I 

didn't tell her that our best probably wouldn't be good enough, 

and that if her son survived he’d probably be disabled for the rest 

of his life.  I didn't tell her that she and her husband would be 

billed for the helicopter flight, and the days or weeks to come in 

the intensive care unit, and that the total would probably reach a 

hundred thousand dollars, maybe a whole lot more.  I didn't tell

her that she and her husband would empty their savings and 

mortgage their home in an effort to pay the bill, and that it 

wouldn't be enough.  And that the coins put in a coffee can at the 

local diner wouldn't come close to covering the difference.   I 

didn't tell her that the unpaid balance of her son’s bill will push 

Grady hospital closer to insolvency, closer to its own crash, and if 

Grady closes, north Georgia, a region of more than five million 

people, will lose its only level one trauma center, its only burn 

unit, its only poison control center, its only emergency 

psychiatric unit, and seven hundred and fifty inpatient beds.  

And that’s not all.  If Grady closes, metro Atlanta’s private 

hospitals, already overburdened by population growth, will topple 

like dominos one after another.  Ladies and gentleman, for me 

this debate is not an idle intellectual exercise, it’s about lives.  

Three hundred million American lives.  I support this resolution 

for three reasons.  First, because our failure to cover every 

American is a national disgrace.  Second, because we’ll never 

achieve universal coverage if we don’t make health care in this 

country more affordable.  And third, because the only way we can 

make health care more affordable and cover everyone is through 

a well-regulated health care marketplace, and to do that the 

Federal Government must be involved.  Now let me be clear, the 

majority of Americans do not want a government-only health care 

system, but they absolutely want the government involved, as a 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

referee, as a cop, to make sure that everybody plays by the rules.  

The other side of this debate will try to convince you that rising 

health care costs are due to government interference.  Well, 

they’ve got it backwards.  The problem is not government 

interference with the health care industry, the problem today is 

health care industry interference with government.  That’s why 

the business of medicine is booming.  Record profits, huge 

executive salaries, bonuses, health care costs spiraling out of 

control year after year after year.  But the caring side of medicine 

is failing. On the front lines, doctors, nurses, and other health 

care professionals are nearly as frustrated as you are.  The 

nation-wide crisis in emergency care is a case in point.  Every 

major challenge we face, ER’s packed with patients, dangerously 

long waits to be seen, a half million ambulances a year turned 

away to more distant hospitals, and fewer specialists than ever 

willing to take ER call.  All of them are due to the fact that the 

economics of health care encourage hospitals to favor elective 

cases over emergency cases.  Good for business, bad for patients.  

And it’s terribly expensive.  Country music star Dolly Parton once 

quipped, you have no idea how much it costs to look this cheap.  

[LAUGHTER]  The same can be said about American health care.  

You have no idea how much it costs to run this poorly.  We spend 

two trillion dollars a year on health care, and a trillion dollars is a 

lot of money.  Put this in perspective, a million seconds ago was

last week.  A billion seconds ago Jimmy Carter was inaugurated 

president.  A trillion seconds ago was thirty thousand BC.  For 

two trillion dollars we can take good care of everybody in this 

country and have a lot left over, and you don’t have to look 

outside the US for proof.  If everybody practiced medicine as 

efficiently as they do in Rochester, Minnesota and Salt Lake City, 

Utah, Medicare could pay thirty percent less to doctors and 

hospitals, and everybody would get better care.  But it won't 

happen on its own, because one person’s waste is another 

person’s revenue stream.  That's why we need a cop on the beat, 

and the only cop with the clout to get the health care industry to 

play by the rules is the federal government.  My side has given 

you several reasons to vote for tonight’s resolution, but the most 

compelling one of all is your own self interest, because a health 

care system that doesn't work for everyone may not work for you 

when the chips are down.  Take it from me, an ER doc, no one 

can predict when a life threatening emergency may strike, but if 

it does, you’ll want your hospital to go the extra mile, not your 

ambulance.

nation’s leading think tank, formed around the philosophy of 

libertarianism, which can very crudely and primitively, 

simplistically be summed up as “live and let live.”  But I suppose 

the question is, do you need insurance to follow through on that?  

[LAUGHTER]  Michael is arguing against, broadly and firmly 

against the notion of universal health coverage being the 

responsibility of the federal government.  Michael?   

MICHAEL CANNON 

Thank you.  We do have a moral obligation to care for those who 

are in need of medical care, but that’s not where the 

disagreement lies tonight.  Where we disagree is over whether 

universal coverage is going to help us fulfill that moral obligation, 

or as I will argue, make that moral obligation harder to fulfill.  So, 

you’ve heard a lot of things about how wonderful universal 

coverage will be.  You’ve heard that it will probably be all things 

to all men and women.  They’ll make us taller and thinner and 

it’ll save us money.  So let’s look at a couple of the actual likely 

effects of adopting universal coverage here in the United States.  

First off, it’s not going to save us money.  Yes, other countries do 

universal coverage, and they do it on the cheap, or they do it for 

less money than we do, but there’s absolutely no way that can 

happen in the United States, and here’s why.  Expanding 

insurance coverage means more people are going to go to the 

doctor, more people are going to use medical services.  That costs

more money.  The urban institute estimates that it would cost at 

least a hundred and twenty billion dollars.  That’s at least, it’s 

going to cost a lot more than that.  Now, with the government in 

control, it’s tempting to think that we would be able to ratchet 

that spending down over time so that we’re more in line with 

other, other nations.  But with the government in control of the, 

whatever universal coverage scheme you can dream up, the 

industry is going to prevent the government from doing just that.  

Art Kellermann is right, the industry does have too much 

influence over government spending in the Medicare program.  

And they use that influence to prevent the government from 

reducing, from reducing spending, from eliminating inefficient 

spending, wasteful spending. They’ve done it for Medicare’s entire 

history. So although it’s tempting to think that we could do 

health, we could do universal coverage, and we could have, and 

we could save money on it in the process, we would have an 

easier time moving the uninsured to Switzerland than we would 

have moving Switzerland’s spending levels here to the United 

States.  Now, you’ve also heard that universal coverage would 

improve the quality of care.  We actually have some pretty 

systemic problems when it comes to quality here in the United 

States.  I'm not a big proponent of the US health care sector.  The 

experts tell us that if you have, the uninsured only get 

recommended--what the evidence says, is the best recommended

care about half of the time.  But you know what, quality 

problems are so systemic that people in Medicare, in Medicaid, 

and people in the United Kingdom’s national health service, 

which is their universal coverage system, also only get quality, 

what the evidence says is best care about half of the time.  

Government, and then the reason is that government doesn't pay 

for quality, and it’s been lagging in the private sector in coming 

up with quality improving innovations.  Now in the private sector 

we have the same quality problem, but I’ll have more to say about 

that in a moment.  One big quality problem is that we have 

alarming rates of medical error here in the United States.  

Universal Coverage is not going to help to prevent these medical 

errors.  It’s not going to help nurses read doctors’ chicken 

scratchings and avoid the errors associated with those. It’s not 

going to encourage physicians and other clinicians to wash their 

hands between patients so they're not passing on infections.  Nor 

is it going to prevent errors by encouraging doctors to follow 

standardized protocols when inserting a central line.  The same 

institute of medicine, I'm surprised this statistics hasn’t come up 

today, but I’ll bring it up, the Institution of Medicine, the 

commission where Dr. Kellermann served, estimated that 

eighteen thousand Americans die every year from lack of health 

insurance.  I believe that.  That seems plausible to me.  The same 

Institute of Medicine, however, estimated that up to a hundred

thousand Americans die every year due to medical errors in 

hospitals.  All universal coverage is going to do is bring more 

people into that system, broken system, it’s not going to do 

anything to fix that system.  And yes, we might save the one, this 

one life over here, from this person who didn't have health 

insurance.  We’d be ignoring these five deaths over here.  Another 

quality problem that we have in the United States is we have 

alarming disparities in health outcomes.  We have disparities 

between different racial groups of fifteen to twenty years in terms 

of life expectancy.  And some Americans face mortality risks 

similar to what you see in Russia and sub-Saharan Africa.  

Universal coverage is not going to do anything to solve that 

problem.  Sherry Glied, who’s the head of the Mailman School of 

Public Health at Columbia University wrote recently, quote, 

socio-economic differentials in health are large and growing, and 

appear to be growing, uh, in countries that have universal 

coverage as well as those that do not.  End quote. Now, it’s true, 

universal coverage may save some lives.  It may save this one life 

over here.  So that seems to be something in its favor.  But 

actually here the news isn't even all that good, because health 

economists tell us that if you have a dollar to spend on improving 

health, there’s absolutely no evidence that spending that dollar 

on universal coverage is going to get your more of an 

improvement in health than spending that dollar on any number

of other things, including clinics, reducing medical errors, 

improving nutrition, fighting poverty, or even improving 

education.  So, ironically, to vote for universal coverage does not 

show how much, how much you care about your neighbor’s 

health, it actually shows how little you care about your 

neighbor’s health, because you're willing to forgot he added 

health benefits that might come from some of the, from spending 

that dollar on some of those other strategies.  Now there is 

something very wrong with America’s health care sector, 

something that universal coverage will not solve.  You can see 

what’s wrong, you can see what it is, I think, when you look at 

the Veteran’s Health Administration.  Now I can't remember if 

this has come up already, if Professor Krugman mentioned the 

Veteran’s Health Administration.  But this is hailed by people 

who support universal coverage as how, as exhibiting the 

superiority of government when dealing with the problems 

presented by health care.  I think that the VA story is very 

important, but I don’t think it tells the story that supporters of 

universal, of universal coverage think that it tells.  The VA has 

made impressive strides, using electronic medical records, to 

focus on preventive care, improving quality, avoiding medical 

errors.  The reason is not some inherent superiority of 

government, the reason is really just two features of the way the 

VA is organized.  They're called integration and pre-payment.  If

anyone cares we can talk about what those mean later on.  But 

those features are not unique to the Veteran’s Health 

Administration.  They exist in private health plans all over the 

country, you know them as plans like Group Health Cooperative, 

Kaiser Permanente, and those plans are using health information 

technologies to reduce costs, improve quality, and reduce errors.  

Now why don’t you have electronic medical, electronic medical 

records, like you have electronic financial records?  Why doesn't 

the hospital remember your medical history, your child’s medical 

history, your allergies, and these sorts of things?  Well, the 

biggest reason is America’s pursuit of universal coverage.  

Medicare is America’s great experiment with universal coverage, 

and it’s also the largest purchaser of medical care in the nation.  

And Medicare actually penalizes doctors and hospitals if they use 

electronic medical records to reduce costs, or to avoid medical 

errors. Electronic records help avoid duplication, but Medicare 

pays for duplication.  So, if you adopt those, you make less 

money.  Health information technologies avoid, help to avoid 

medical errors, but Medicare pays for medical errors.  So, if you 

adopt those health information technologies, you lose money.  So, 

providers make less money if they do these things that are in 

patient’s interests.  Meanwhile, supporters of universal coverage 

are trying to keep those private health plans that use these 

things from participating in Medicare. With doesn't Medicare stop

paying for duplication and errors?  Because government resists 

change.  So, I don’t think the VA success, the VA success has 

demonstrated government’s brilliance so much as how 

government actually impedes the support of quality affordable 

health care.  Thank you.

Well, you’ve now heard all of the opening statements, and we’re 

at the point of being able to share with you the poll results we 

took among you, the audience, when you first arrived.  And 

they’ll come up on the screen behind me.  Before the debate 

began forty-nine percent of you were for the motion, twenty-four 

percent against, twenty-seven percent undecided, which you 

know means that if you three leave right now, you’ve won.  

Yeah…  I think we’re past that point.  John Stossel, Art 

Kellermann suggested that there’s a conflict between keeping 

people healthy and making money keeping people healthy.  What 

about that?   

JOHN STOSSEL 

There are conflicts always in making a profit and delivering 

service to your customers.  And you get rich if you service your 

customers well.  The hospital that keeps people healthiest gets a

reputation for doing a good job, and that’s how capitalism works, 

you get rich by doing well.   

JOHN DONVAN  

But I heard you also argue that you feel there would be much 

less innovation in the US system if we went, if there were not a 

profit motive behind development.   

JOHN STOSSEL 

Totally.  We take the benefits of the profit motive for granted all 

the time.  The fact that I can go to a foreign country, stick a piece 

of plastic in the wall, and cash will come out.  And I can give that 

card to a total stranger who doesn't even speak English, and he’ll 

rent me a car for the week.  And when I get home Visa or 

MasterCard will have the accounting correct to he penny. But the 

government can't even count the votes accurately.  [LAUGHTER]  

And yet our instinct… [APPLAUSE] …is to go to government.

We had a lot of talking about cars earlier, and, I think everybody 

is familiar with the economic problems that GM is having right 

now, and actually I think GM’s cars are better than Trabant.   

But they're carrying about five billion dollars a year in health care 

costs.  Several years ago the CEO at GM testified before Congress 

and said two billion dollars out of their bottom line every year

was just for drugs.  Now meanwhile, Pfizer, the second largest 

pharmaceutical company in the United States, last year reported 

nineteen billion dollars in profit, thirty-seven percent profit 

margin.  Now, I’m a big believer in market economics too but I 

don’t want our auto industry to wind up in Ontario, I’d like to 

keep a lot of it in Michigan.  So I don’t understand, I mean I do 

think profit is good but I think when one industry can basically 

drive another one into the ground and harm our country, 

regulation is outta whack, and let me just—one other point.   The 

FDA cannot take the cost of a drug into consideration when it 

approves a new drug, it just has to be better than nothing.  That’s 

not by accident. Congress prohibits the FDA from considering 

cost-effectiveness of new drugs.   That’s not the case in the UK, 

it’s not the case in other countries, it should not be the case 

here—

coverage plan and we could just get the industry out of it, we 

could just not have the industry be a part of it, we could…cut off 

their influence.   But we know that the industry’s always going to 

be around, we know that there’ll always be drug companies and 

greedy private health insurance companies.  And Republicans 

who will mess things up like they messed up FEMA and they 

mess up everything else.   So you can’t say that universal 

coverage is this wonderful idea and we can separate out this 

part--this is an inherent part.  Unless you’ve— all the rent-

seeking from the industry, and all the buffoonery from the 

Republicans, unless you have a plan to abolish Republicans 

they’re part of your plan.  [LAUGHTER]

Sally Pipes—   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

—gotta be honest, and—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Let’s bring Sally Pipes into the conversation, she is against the 

motion.    

SALLY PIPES 

I just wanted to talk a little bit about Medicare, remember when, 

in 1965 when Medicare and Medicaid came in, and the cost was 

about $3 billion, and it was projected to cost $12 billion in 1990.  



Media Transcripts, Inc.

Well in fact it cost $107 billion, last year it cost $427 billion, it’s 

estimated in 2017 to cost $884 billion, the Medicare trustees way 

the program will be broke in 2019.   There is no cost control in 

Medicare, it is completely out of control.  I think we need to give 

vouchers to people on Medicare and put consumers and seniors 

back in charge of their health care.  But the issue is, are—is 

everyone loving Medicare.   The recent Congressional commission 

said, that one in three Medicare patients is having a very hard 

time getting a doctor, and I have talked to many seniors, who are 

having a hard time getting a doctor under Medicare.  Because the 

reimbursement rates by the government for the 8000 procedures 

on the list are too low and docs say I’m not going to do it.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Sally Pipes, hold on just a moment because I want to come back 

to you for another question, I want to at this point tell the 

audience that in a couple of minutes I will be coming to you for 

questions and there are microphones being held by ushers 

toward the rear.   And if you raise your hand, they will find you 

and then I will find you so just wave in my direction to get my 

attention.  Sally Pipes and Michael Rachlis,  you’re both born, 

raised, trained in Canada, but hearing you, Michael, argue for 

the proposition, and Sally Pipes hearing you argue against it, 

I’m—are you from the same country?  [LAUGHTER]

key people doing international research, maybe she can speak for 

herself, as to whether or not it is useless, but I feel that—  

MICHAEL CANNON

MICHAEL RACHLIS 

—I feel that the international research is valuable and it shows, 

that by and large, other countries are delivering the same level of 

care, the unfortunate thing that happened to your mother, Sally, 

I’m very sorry for that, could easily happen in the United States, 

it could happen in any other country.   A family doctor, who 

doesn’t, you know, for a variety of reasons, take a particular 

complaint seriously, that stuff happens, the rate of medical error 

in all developed countries is about the same, although the 

studies have been done slightly differently, eight countries have 

done studies.  In all countries, 5 to 10 percent of all deaths are 

preventable deaths that occur in hospital.  So that—modern 

health care has some very serious problems and is—this country 

in fact is a leader in looking at quality in health care.   Dr. Donald 

Berwick, the founder of the Institute for Health Care 

Improvement, is the person, the preeminent person in the world, 

on this issue.  But—

the system through their taxes.  What tax increases would we 

have to have here in America, to provide another $120 billion—

‘cause none of you are running for President.  [LAUGHTER]   

SALLY PIPES 

Mike and I are ineligible—   

ART KELLERMANN 

Second thing.  Sally, you mentioned about Medicare.  You know, 

we’ve had a recent experiment with private health plan efficiency, 

private health plans have started administering Medicare.  

They’re getting paid an average of 12 percent more per enrollee, 

that’s nearly $1000 more per person than traditional Medicare 

administers the same program.  This is going to add 8.5 billion to 

the cost of Medicare this year in 2008, and since 2004, those 

plans will have sucked an extra $33 billion out of Medicare trust 

fund, without improving the care to beneficiary, so, again, 

Michael, I think you’re right, we got a lotta people that have 

gotten their hands around the federal till, and have made federal 

government a cash cow.  I think federal government needs to be a 

watchdog.

MICHAEL CANNON 

—about the, about how Medicare Advantage costs the taxpayers 

more.  I want to agree that--and I disagree with Sally that I don’t 

think that we do any better in terms of health outcomes here in 

the United States.  But those things don’t get you where you 

think they do.   The fact that private insurance companies are 

ripping off the taxpayers through Medicare is problematic, but 

the alternative is to let the doctors in the hospitals do that 

because they’re the ones who’ve been doing that for the first 40 

years.    

ART KELLERMANN 

I want to say one other thing—   

MICHAEL CANNON 

And—no, I’m not done yet.  [LAUGHTER]  So, and the fact that we 

don’t lead the—I don’t think we lead the world in terms of health 

outcomes but that just means that we’re doing poorly, other 

nations are doing poorly, no one is innovating in order to make 

those improvements in medical errors, except, you know, we got 

the Kaisers and the Group Healths out there that are actually 

doing this, and you just made an argument against having them 

participate in Medicare, you’re trying to keep them—those 

innovations out of a government program.

the two minutes because we—

Can I just add—   

JOHN DONVAN  

—do want to go to the audience and-- gentlemen.   If you’re a 

member of the media we ask you to identify yourself by name and 

organization, otherwise it’s your choice.  Sir?  And remember, 30 

seconds.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Isn’t the dirty secret that we cannot afford to have everyone have 

all the health care that they would possibly want, and so in 

America we ration it by price, and in other countries you ration it 

by lottery.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Paul Krugman, let’s hear from you on that—   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

Yeah, no, that’s definitely true.  There is, although, it’s not clear 

that we’re really at the point where that’s the critical limitation, 

that’s—at this point, just eliminating health care that actually 

does no good at all would probably be enough to save a large 

amount, that’s what the Congressional Budget Office says, so it’s 

not a really a— in the very long run, what happens when we have 

the $30 million immortality treatment, that sort of thing, this 

becomes a big problem.  Look, I just want to bring—one more

thing, we’ve been talking a lot about quality of care but there’s 

one other thing that is very important which is the financial ruin 

that often comes from medical expenses.   And that is 

preventable and that’s only in America, the individual who is 

finan—the family that’s financially ruined.  Every time I look at 

one of the studies that says well we can’t show that providing 

health insurance makes that much difference in health 

outcomes.  First of all I don’t quite believe it but secondly, there 

is a tremendous difference in terms of not the medical side but 

the economic side and this is something again, there’s a risk, a 

fear, a terror of medical expenses, which happens among wealthy 

countries only in America.    

MICHAEL CANNON 

I’m glad, Professor Krugman, that you’re letting some economics 

creep into your remarks tonight.  I want to point out though that 

the AARP recently released a study that showed that bankruptcy 

rates are rising fastest, among those people who are covered by 

our only universal coverage program.   Not only are they rising 

faster among that group than for other groups but for other 

groups, those bankruptcy rates are falling, how is that consistent 

with what you said about universal coverage protecting us from 

financial ruin—   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

But that’s the—  No, I’m not talking about bankruptcy rates, I’m

talking about all kinds of people—   

MICHAEL CANNON 

Well, what—    

PAUL KRUGMAN  

And you know, those are—  

MICHAEL CANNON

MICHAEL CANNON 

Give me another measure of financial ruin.   

PAUL KRUGMAN  

No, come on, there are—   

JOHN DONVAN 

All right, let’s go back to the audience, in the middle, you want to 

identify yourself.    

BETSY McCAUGHEY 

Yes, I’m Betsy McCaughey from the Hudson Institute.  I’m 

worried about seniors and what the impact will be of a Medicare-

for-all system on them.  In countries with Medicare for all seniors 

are denied treatments that seniors in the US can get, the 

thinking is that the public health dollars are better spent on 

young people because the benefits will be more lasting.   For 

example two years ago the British National Health Service 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Universal Health Coverage 

                                           Should Be the Federal Government’s Responsibility” (9/16/08) Page 55. 

 

 

 

decreed, that seniors with wet macular degeneration could not 

get the drug Lucentis until they had already gone blind in one 

eye, then they could get it to save the other eye.   Why should 

seniors in the United States take that risk and support a 

Medicare-for-all system.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Sally Pipes?   

SALLY PIPES 

Exactly.  Well the thing is that in Great—in Britain there are 

other examples, Tarceva, the drug for lung cancer that is 

available here.  It—you know, if the NIHCE, the National Institute 

for Health and Clinical Excellence, a government bureaucracy 

says, Tarceva is not cost-effective and therefore you’re too old to 

have it, you’re denied it.   You can go out and pay for it in the 

market, but all of your services provided then under the National 

Health Service, are no longer available to you.  Is this what we 

want, this is what we’re talking about in Congress right now with 

the CER, the Comparative Effectiveness Research.   We want to 

do this in the United States, this is going to destroy the 

innovation that John Stossel was talking about, and it’s going to 

destroy our ability to live longer and healthier lives, it’s not what 

the American people want.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Sally Pipes is against the motion.  Gentleman, on the right.

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

There are a lot of personal stories being told tonight.  And I’m 

glad to say that I have health insurance.  And the idea of 

increased wait times for a medical procedure, that terrifies me.  

But then I think about the 15 percent of America who have no 

insurance.   And how long are their wait times.  So basically like 

what I can’t wrap my brain around is, how can a system based 

on companies, that make a profit on denying our care be made 

responsible for paying for our care.   

JOHN DONVAN 

John Stossel.   

JOHN STOSSEL 

 [PAUSE]  Well, you’re right, the insurance companies have a 

conflict, and, the insurance company has to balance, they want 

to pay for nothing, they hope none of you ever get sick and if you 

get sick they don’t want to pay.  But, of course if they do that, 

word gets out, and they don’t get any new customers, so that’s 

how they have to balance that.  [LAUGHTER]   

SALLY PIPES 

You know—   

JOHN STOSSEL 

That’s how all businesses balance that, and—   

MICHAEL CANNON 

Or, or they wouldn’t if you were able to choose your insurance

company…   

JOHN STOSSEL 

That’s the other problem, that you have to buy insurance here in 

New York, from a New York insurance company, and because the 

politicians always wanting to give you more have loaded it up 

with all these extra guarantees, they—you must pay for Viagra 

and in-vitro fertilization and acupuncture or hypnosis or pastoral 

counseling, I forget what’s all on the list that’s mandated—   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

Oh, okay, can I just—this is—   

JOHN STOSSEL 

You’re not allowed to buy from Wisconsin where insurance costs 

a fourth as much.    

PAUL KRUGMAN 

The reason you have to buy from a New York insurance company 

is because New York has community rating, which means that an 

insurance company cannot turn you down if you have a 

preexisting condition.  And if they throw it open, across the 

country, then, people who don’t have a preexisting condition, 

people who are healthy can go shopping, and it’s not some kind 

of crazy thing because they want people to have hypnosis.   

JOHN STOSSEL 

Actually—

PAUL KRUGMAN 

It’s because they’re trying to protect people who would not 

otherwise be able to get insurance, and that gets at the 

irresponsibility of the arguments that are made so often—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Paul Krugman—   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

—in this case—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—Art Kellermann.    

ART KELLERMANN 

There’ve been so many points out here that I wish we could 

address, one I want to talk about is waiting times, because you 

hear that all the time.  The waiting times that matter, are the 

waiting times for things like, when you go to the ER and how 

quickly you see a doctor for a heart attack.   How quickly you get 

stroke care.  Whether or not if you’ve got acute or worrisome 

symptoms you can see your doctor that day or the next day or 

you end up having to be in an ER.  We’re turning away one 

ambulance per minute in this country from overcrowded private 

as well as public hospitals in the United States.   If you’ve got to 

limp around for two months on a bum knee until you get a new 

titanium knee, I’m sorry.  That’s not going to kill you.  You don’t 

get to me for 30 or 45 minutes because you’ve been diverted from

three hospitals, you’re going to die.  That’s the waiting times that 

we need to worry about in the United States and it’s not going to 

happen if we ignore this problem.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Michael Cannon, against the motion.   

MICHAEL CANNON 

Professor Krugman mentioned that community rating laws like 

you have here in New York are intended to help the sick obtain 

health insurance.  The leading researcher in the country on 

insurance markets, specifically the individual market where you 

buy insurance directly is a man named Mark Paul, he’s at the 

University of Pennsylvania.   And what he’s found after 

researching, what actually happens in insurance markets, is he’s 

found that those laws reduce—the community rating laws that 

Professor Krugman favors--reduce the number of people with 

health insurance, and they don’t provide health insurance to 

many more sick people, and the reason is that unregulated 

markets really do a remarkably good job of providing health 

insurance to people with expensive chronic conditions, provided 

they purchase health insurance while they’re still healthy.  So 

these regulations—   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

Yeah.  [LAUGHTER]  If they—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Universal Health Coverage

MICHAEL CANNON 

And—yeah.  And it’s expensive and difficult to do, but you cannot 

have an insurance market unless people do that, because no 

one’ll buy insurance until they need it.  No— you can’t have a 

fire—a homeowner’s insurance market if people can buy coverage 

after their house burns down.   That is the market’s way of 

encouraging people to do the right thing and pay into the pool 

while they’re still healthy.  

SALLY PIPES 

[UNCLEAR]—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Ma’am, right—a question from the audience, ma’am?   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Yes, I have a question about America’s competitiveness, and how 

it’s influenced by these issues.  Art Kellermann mentioned 

GM,…I was also thinking about another engine of growth which 

is entrepreneurs, in America, most new jobs are generated by 

entrepreneurs, not by big companies.   And usually, 

entrepreneurs cannot offer health care because the rates are so 

prohibitive.  So this in fact decreases our competitiveness.  And 

this is just one issue along with the big companies, I mean, 

globalization’s not going to go away.  I think it would be a relief to 

many sectors if health care wasn’t a drag on their profits—  



Media Transcripts, Inc.

JOHN DONVAN 

So your question is—  

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I’m looking at big business and how it affects globalization—   

JOHN DONVAN 

But you would like to know—   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

—but also—   

JOHN DONVAN 

But you would kind of like to know what—   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

Okay, I would like to know the pan—the, the two pan—the six 

panelists’, views on, how can we possibly keep going forward the 

way we are if we’re status quo, when we’re going to have huge 

competition from India, China, and other places—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Yeah—   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

—that can—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Well,  I—

JOHN DONVAN 

—John, I think that’s right up your alley, that question.   

JOHN STOSSEL 

We already have huge competition from China and India and 

Europe, these countries with universal care.  And by and large 

we’re cleaning their clocks.  America’s created 20 million new 

jobs while Europe created two.  So—two million, so, yes, GM has 

to pay more for health care than steel, and that’s awful, but in 

these other countries, they have to pay huge amounts in taxes, 

and that’s even more crippling.    

PAUL KRUGMAN  

Point of fact, I think the United States created 23 million jobs 

when some other guy was President…and actually employment 

growth in Europe has been faster since 2000 than the United 

States, so, that’s a little bit out of date.    

MICHAEL RACHLIS 

And I would like to add that—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Michael Rachlis—   

JOHN STOSSEL 

I—

JOHN STOSSEL 

I think you’re cherry-picking times, you picked the 20 years…the 

United States has created—   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

I don’t know what—  

JOHN STOSSEL 

—10 times as many jobs—   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

—that 20-year period—that 20 million figure refers to, I think 

that was a number just sort of plucked out of air.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Okay, let’s stop there—   

MICHAEL RACHLIS 

I—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—getting off the topic, Michael Rachlis—   

MICHAEL RACHLIS 

Yeah, that in all this talk about health care with traditional 

economic models, that really, that is one of the main reasons why 

you folks have not been able to make progress.  That is, using 

traditional marketplace models, focused on that as your ideology 

to analyze health care, which is not in any way close to being a 

traditional economic market.   And to apply some sort of 

economic… language the way we’re hearing from the other side, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Universal Health Coverage

to a system which is—where the supply side is massively 

regulated, for good reasons.  You know, do you want to be able 

to—going to have to look up every single provider that you see to 

find out whether or not they passed their licensing exams or not?   

You know, I—the extension would—of this argument would be 

Milton Friedman’s one that, just absolutely no regulation 

whatsoever.  But, that—   

MICHAEL CANNON 

Fine with me—   

MICHAEL RACHLIS 

—that doesn’t deal with health care where it by and large for key 

decisions, consumers can never be at the same information level 

as the agent who’s recommending those services—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Sally Pipes, you look like you’re dying to say something.   

SALLY PIPES 

I’m just dying to say that, we got—a lot of the mess that we’re in 

in this country including part of the 46 million is because, federal 

government gave employers a tax advantage to provide health 

insurance.   And as a result, people in America, 60 percent of 

people in America get their health insurance through their 

employer.  If you lose your job or you quit your job, we don’t have 

portable health insurance.  If we make a few simple tax changes, 

such as refundable tax credits or an income tax deduction,  we

really need to focus on growing the individual market, so that 

people can buy insurance across state lines, people can get the 

type of insurance that fits their needs, we can grow the individual 

insurance market because competition will work.   And when we 

have 1900 mandates on insurance across this country, it’s 

impossible for an insurer to provide a stripped-down policy 

which…two-thirds of the uninsured are in that 18-to-30 age 

bracket, and they don’t want to buy insurance with, as John 

said, in-vitro fertilization, alcohol rehabilitation.   We can open up 

this market, and cover a lot of those people because of the 46 

million uninsured, 17 million earn over $50,000 a year, and 10 

million earn over 75,000, a lot are younger, they’re healthy, and 

they don’t want to pay $4,000 a year for insurance to cover 

things that they don’t need to care for—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Sally Pipes, question down front, please—   

MICHAEL RACHLIS 

Most—many of those folks have illnesses, and they cannot get 

insurance no matter how much money they pay—

But if we open up the market, new competitors would come into 

the market—

MICHAEL CANNON 

Health care presents a lot of interesting challenges, and the 

question is not, oh, well, it’s special so therefore markets can’t do 

it.  The question is, well, you know, markets and governments 

have advantages and disadvantages and, which one works best, 

which set of tools works best for this particular problem.   I’ve 

always enjoyed hearing from proponents of universal coverage 

that the US has this market-driven, for-profit health care sector, 

you know, the government controls half of the money in our 

health care sector.   And because of government tax policy, 

employers control another quarter of it.  So, 75 percent of the 

money is controlled by someone other than the consumer, how in 

any way, is that a free market.  I’m reminded of a favorite 

expression, expression of my brother’s, he likes to say, you know, 

you’re pissing on my shoes and telling me that it’s raining.   

What’s driving these costs and what’s driving these quality 

problems are those 75 percent.  So—well, I’ll stop there.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, question down front—   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I have a quick question for Dr. Kellermann, you mentioned the 

Mayo Clinic as a model of efficiency and I think we all recognize it 

as a model of great health care, what’s the impediment right now 

to having more Mayo Clinics in this country, why don’t we have

them if the market can provide that, and I don’t know that we 

could look anywhere—  People come all over the world to Mayo 

Clinic, why doesn’t universal health care coverage provide that in 

other places.   

ART KELLERMANN 

The Mayo Clinic has a great philosophy.  It’s very heavily focused 

on primary care, they’re very heavily focused on efficiency.  You 

don’t have to be efficient to be successful in this country.  I just 

have to talk you into getting all the tests that I want you to get, I 

need to talk you into getting the procedures you want.   You 

know, we just talked about economics.  Everybody these days is 

complaining about gas prices with good reason.  But if we ran 

our oil industry the way we’re running our health care industry 

gasoline would cost $16 a gallon and one out of every six 

American cars couldn’t burn it.  We can do better than that.  

JOHN DONVAN  

Question from the back there?   

TONY MEYER 

My name is Tony Meyer and I care about this issue too, and in 

2002 I founded a company that today is one of the largest 

managers of defined-contribution programs for corporate 

America, and we work with General Motors and Ford and 

Chrysler and many other great American industrial companies—

JOHN DONVAN  

This had better be a question, not a commercial—   

TONY MEYER  

There is, there is, this is not an advertisement.  [LAUGHTER]  My 

question, and Ms. Pipes, you just mentioned it, no one has talked 

about the fact that, we have a unique health care delivery system 

which is really managed by large employers, it’s unique in the 

world.   Nobody’s talked about whether that’s a problem or a 

solution, should it be reformed, discarded, modified.  I’d be 

curious what the panel thinks of that approach.   

SALLY PIPES 

Well, and I did mention, I think it does need to be changed 

because if your employer—   

TONY MEYER 

Discarded.    

SALLY PIPES 

[LAUGHS]  Yes.  I mean if your employer is paying about $15,000 

for your health coverage, that might not be the kind of health 

coverage that fits you as an individual, you may not want that 

type, but if we open up the market, and give individuals the same 

tax incentive—   Because if you go out in the individual market 

and buy insurance, you don’t get a tax break on that, but if you 

get it in decreased wages but through your employer, it’s cheaper 

and you—and you’re able to get it because you’re part of that

pool.   So we need to, as John says, actually discard that model 

and move away from it.  You know, we can’t move away from it 

overnight, but we can make some changes in the tax code, that 

will allow the individual market to grow, and we need—  we don’t 

get our life insurance, we don’t get our long-term care insurance, 

our home insurance from our employer.   As I said, this was a gift 

during World War II, and it was a terrible gift that has distorted 

in my mind a great deal of the health care system—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Paul Krugman.   

PAUL KRUGMAN 

Yeah, it’s not the system you would design if you were starting 

from scratch and it’s not the system we want to end up with.  But 

it’s a system that at least did the basics of risk-pooling for a lot of 

people, it’s a system that did deal with the problems of 

preexisting conditions and people being screened and does 

somewhat reduce the problem of insurance companies, not to 

deliver care but to, who can do the best job of finding who really 

needs insurance so as not to give it to them.   So it’s not—I have 

no brief with that system, but, the idea that what we need to do 

is scrap it and move to an individual insurance market which has 

never worked anywhere, it’s the most amazing thing, that what 

we have coming from the conservative side is the belief that, 

universal health care, which works all across the world, is

undoable.   And that an individual market, which has never 

worked anywhere, is the answer to our problems, extraordinary 

leap of faith.

JOHN DONVAN  

Time is up for this section.  [LAUGHTER]  Thank you very much 

to the audience for, actually, terrific questions.  I want to remind 

you, just before we move to the summing-up section where each 

of the panelists will have two minutes, I want to remind you of 

how you voted when you came in if we can put the slide up again.   

Before the debate, 49 percent of you agreed with the proposition 

that universal health coverage should be the federal government’s 

responsibility.  24 percent of you were against that motion and 

27 percent were undecided.   In the next 10 to 12 minutes you

will hear a summing up and then we will vote one further time, 

and our first panelist to begin his two-minute summary, John 

Stossel.   

JOHN STOSSEL 

Oh—okay.  [LAUGHTER]  If you think health care is expensive 

now, wait till you see how expensive it is when it’s free.  

[LAUGHTER]  When it’s free there are no controls.  I don’t think 

this side is saying the American system is a good system, it’s not 

a market.   We’re spending other people’s money, government is 

already involved spending about half the money, third parties pay 

for seven out of every eight dollars, this is an awful way to pay for 

things.  Think how it would work for your car insurance worked 

that way, if they paid for your gas and your oil you wouldn’t care 

what gas costs and people would sell you $100 oil changes.   

That’s what’s going on in health care under insurance companies 

paying, or the government.  And employment-based insurance 

makes no sense when four out of 10 Americans change jobs now 

every year.   Government is not the answer, we don’t have 

government steel mills or government airlines anymore because 

they were awful, and once they had competition they went outta 

business.  Michael says medicine’s different, but, every 

profession says that.  The truth is it—it’s true, you don’t—you’re 

not an expert, you don’t know which doctor’s the best.  But you 

don’t know which car’s the best, you’re not car engineers.  But

through word of mouth the good news spreads, the bad 

companies go out of business, the good doctors will take over, 

and we see this now, where there is a market, the tiny places, 

like cosmetic surgery, lasek eye surgery.  The doctors give you 

their email addresses.  Does your doctor do that?  They give out 

their cell phone numbers, the waiting rooms are nice.  And the 

prices are going down, while the quality is going up.  The post 

office can never give us what FedEx can.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, John Stossel.  [APPLAUSE]  John Stossel…John 

Stossel, speaking against the motion.  Speaking for the motion in 

his summary, Paul Krugman.    

PAUL KRUGMAN 

[SIGHS]  In the course of this debate I actually felt…I don’t know 

whether the audience will agree but I actually felt that John 

Stossel in effect conceded, when he held up that Trabant at the 

end of it.  Because that just shows, if all you can do is say 

Communism, Communism, East Germany—   I don’t want us to 

move to East Germany.  I just want us to move to France.  Now, 

the…  [LAUGHTER]  Look…government health care isn’t perfect.  

Actually, government health care isn’t the issue, government 

insurance isn’t perfect, so is private insurance.  There are horror 

stories, the nature of health care, is that lots of bad things 

happen.   You don’t generally seek health care, because you’re

feeling great.  But we have extensive experience, we have 

Medicare, which is a system that is flawed but has actually 

shown slower cost inflation, than private health insurance over 

the past 40 years.   We have the Veterans Health Administration 

which is our little island of true socialized medicine in the United 

States.  And it does very well.  And above all, what we have is a 

system right now, remembering what the proposition is, the 

motion is that the federal government should guarantee health 

care.   Not that the government should run everything, not that 

everything should be under government control, not that we 

should nationalize the steel industry, which keeps on being run 

but as you know is not on the agenda or nationalize the auto 

company, but whether there should be a federal guarantee of 

health care for everybody.   And that, I think, is something that 

American values, that our fundamental morality says is 

something we should be doing.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Paul Krugman.  [APPLAUSE]  And making her two-

minute summary against the motion, Sally Pipes.    

SALLY PIPES 

Although it would be nice if the federal government could solve 

all of our health care challenges, current events both at home 

and abroad show that it cannot.  As a Canadian, I watched first-

hand the promise of free health care, and I saw it devolve into the

reality of a high tax bill, and long lines for advanced care. As 

waiting lists grew over the years to more than four months in 

2007, an increasing number of Canadians have traveled to the 

United States for treatment and paid out of pocket, whether it’s 

Mayo, the Cleveland Clinic, or UCSF system.  The number of 

illegal private clinics in Canada has grown significantly over the 

last few years.  The government is afraid to shut them down even 

though private health care is illegal in Canada, for fear of an 

immense outcry.  In June 2005, the Canadian Supreme Court 

ruled, in a monumental decision, that the ban on private health 

care in Quebec is illegal.  Quebecers are entitled to life, liberty, 

and the security of the person.  Long waiting lists do not give you 

that security.  Madame Chief Justice Beverley McLaughlin said, 

access to a waiting list is not access to health care.  Claude 

Castonguay, chair of a Quebec Royal Commission on Health Care 

in the 1960’s recommended that Quebec adopt government 

health care.  The Quebec government followed his advice, and 

they called him the father of Quebec Medicare, just like Tommy 

Douglas, the father of Medicare.  This year he released a report, 

an official government report evaluating Quebec’s ailing health 

care system.  His conclusion, it’s in crisis.  He now urges 

legalization of private health insurance.  Americans believe in 

freedom and personal responsibility, not big government.  They 

don’t want big government controlling our lives.  The question is,

who do you want to control your health care decisions?  An HMO 

bureaucrat, a government bureaucrat, or you yourself?  By 

supporting universal choice in health care, and empowering 

consumers, we will achieve universal coverage.  Thank you.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you Sally Pipes. [APPLAUSE]  I want to mention for the 

purposes of our radio broadcast that Sally Pipes is President and 

Chief Executive Officer of the Pacific Research Institute.  Also 

you’ve heard from John Stossel, John Stossel an ABC News 

correspondent, co-anchor of 20/20, and author of The John 

Stossel Specials.   And we heard from Paul Krugman, an Op-Ed 

columnist for The New York Times, and professor at Princeton 

and the London School of Economics.  We’re next going to hear 

from Michael Rachlis, Michael Rachlis is a physician and health 

policy analyst, the author of Prescription for Excellence: How 

Innovation is Saving Canada’s Health Care System.  Michael, your 

two minutes begin now.   

MICHAEL RACHLIS 

Yes, I want to mention that, that there is virtually no flow of 

Canadians south of the border.  The Canadians getting health 

care south of the border are, like, ninety-nine percent of them are 

like my daughter who had a catfish spine through her palm—

people on vacation.  That there is the waiting list issue, I 

mentioned that it is a problem in Canada, but other countries

with universal systems don’t have waiting list problems.  It is not 

a problem of universal coverage.  And in fact, in Toronto right 

now, because of public response to the concerns about waiting 

lists, if you need cataract surgery, if you need your knee 

replaced, if you need a hip replaced, phone one number, you can 

be seen in an assessment clinic within one week usually, and you 

can get your surgery within a month after that, and it doesn't 

cost you any money directly, because you pay it in your taxes, 

and the taxes in Canada as a share of GDP are almost as low as 

they are in the United States.  And we’ve had surpluses for eleven 

years.  I think what you're hearing from the other side are a 

whole series of anecdotes, and yet the overall research indicates 

that every other wealthy country in the world where you would 

feel comfortable visiting and living has a universal system.  And I 

think what you really have to watch out for is what the New 

Yorker commented on April 20th, 1992, referring to then the first 

president Bush: The compulsion that drives President Bush to 

distort the facts about Canadian Health Care suggests that 

official American policy is in the process of becoming what 

conservatives in discussing the Soviet Union used to call a total 

ideology, a system blindly convinced of its absolute truth, and yet 

so fragile in its relationship to reality that it isn't capable of 

considering even the most obvious reform.  Surely we should 

have learned by now what happens to ideological systems that

begin to deny facts that their people can discover for themselves 

just by crossing a border.  Cross the border, come to Canada, 

anybody in the audience, contact me, I will show you the 

Canadian health care system, and then America should do 

universal coverage in its innovative fashion.  Make health care a 

right, and then do it right.

Michael Rachlis summing up for the proposition.  Summing up 

against the proposition, Michael Cannon, co-author of Health 

Competition: What’s Holding Back Health Care and How to Free It.  

He is the Cato Institute’s director of health policy studies.  

Michael?   

MICHAEL CANNON 

The perception before we came in here, I was standing across 

from a man who was reading his program, and when he came to 

the part with my picture on it, he looked at the picture, he looked 

up at me, and he said, hey, that's you.  And I said, yes, that's me.  

And he said, you're against universal coverage!?  Because I think, 

and this look came over his face, the question that was forming 

was something like, what kind of a moral reprobate could be 

against universal health insurance coverage?  And I know that I 

have a lot of family here tonight who are asking themselves the 

same question.  [LAUGHS]  My opposition stems from two beliefs.

One is that people should have the right to choose their doctor, 

they should have the right to choose their health plan, and those 

things are often lost in system of universal coverage, almost 

uniformly.  No, I think totally lost.  And second, universal 

coverage is not going to make us healthier.  We have serious 

problems here in the United States with rising costs, with low 

quality care, and we have health plans in the private sector that 

are trying to innovate with ways to reduce those costs, and to 

improve the quality of care.  The only problem is, you can't 

choose them, because the government has said you can't.  The 

only problem is that the government controls half of the money in 

our health care sector, and so the industry has, is able to block 

those innovations, because they want to protect their incomes.  

You can have a health care sector that guarantees universal 

coverage, or you can have a health care sector that continuously 

makes medical care better, cheaper, and safer, making it easier 

to deliver on that moral obligation that we have to help the less 

fortunate among us.  You cannot have both.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Michael Cannon.  [APPLAUSE]  Finally, the last word 

goes to Art Kellermann.  Art Kellerman is not a surgeon, as I 

incorrectly said before, Art Kellermann is an ER doctor at Grady 

Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, and a professor at Emory, 

summing up for the motion universal health coverage should be

the federal government’s responsibility.  Dr. Art Kellermann.   

ART KELLERMANN 

Have you all heard the expression that there are no atheists in 

fox holes?  I can tell you, in my experience, there are no 

libertarians in intensive care units.  [LAUGHTER]  It’s widely said 

that Americans can pick their doctor.  The fact of the matter is, if 

you're in a non-group plan, or you're in a plan that doesn't 

contract with these doctors over here, but you can over here, 

every day I see patients whose care is disrupted because their 

plan has shifted doctors, they didn't get the deal they wanted.  

We’ve surrendered an enormous amount of freedom in this 

country to the private insurance industry, and to the rest of the 

industry.  We can collectively together do better.  In just a few 

moments you're going to vote again, and the six of us care a lot 

about how that vote turns out.  But that’s really not the vote that 

matters.  The vote that matters is coming up on November the 

4th, and I encourage every one of you to do your homework, and 

do your homework on the candidate’s positions on health care, 

because they are strikingly different, and they, to some degree, 

break down along the lines of the debate tonight, and it should 

make a difference in the choice that you make then as well as the 

choice you make tonight.  I want to close by going back to the 

bedside of that family.  I didn't tell that mother the whole truth 

that night, but by staying silent and withholding the truth I left

her with something we both needed, which is hope.  Hope that 

her son would beat the odds.  Sometimes we see young people 

come back from catastrophic injuries and do OK.  Hope that 

Georgia and every other state in this country would develop 

efficient, effective regionalized trauma and emergency care 

systems so everyone can have access to life saving emergency 

care.  And most important, hope that this great nation of ours, 

the United States of America, will soon finally do the right thing

my son get the care he needs?  Please vote for tonight’s

So pick up those voting keypads, you may recall that when you 

came in here forty-nine percent of you were for the motion that 

universal health coverage should be a federal responsibility,

quickly.  Number one you're for the motion, number two you are 

against the motion, number three you remain undecided, or 

became undecided.  Anyone need more time?  Everybody’s good?  

OK, I want to thank you, before we go to the results, I just want 

to thank the panelists, and especially all of you in the audience, 

because the questions were first rate, and moved the discussion 

into interesting places.  I want you to also know that our next 

debate will be Tuesday October 7th, 2008.  The motion is going to 

be “America is finally winning the war in Iraq.”  Panelists for this 

motion will be Fred Kagan of AEI, he is widely seen as the 

architect of the surge; and also retired Four Star General Jack 

Keane, for the motion.  Against the motion is Charles Ferguson, 

the writer/director of the Iraq War documentary No End in Sight, 

and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign secretary and defense 

secretary of the UK, and a current member of Parliament.  These 

debates that you are taking part in as audience members can
