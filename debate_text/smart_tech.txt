me is in relation to technology and a little -- you know, a little dabbling you've done in your 
career in a thing called finance, that you had some experience on both sides of the gift of 
technology.  So what's the first part of that? 
 
18:48:18  
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I have.  So about a decade ago, I thought it would be interesting to hire some people and 
see if they could figure out how to beat the stock market.  And I got a group of PhDs, computer 
scientists from MIT and Harvard and so forth.  And basically, with a team of six people, we were 
able to look at every single trade in every one of 6,000 public companies, look at every bit of 
financial data that they -- that they produced and went public with, and were able, ultimately, 
to figure out a way to get -- pick stocks that were going to go up faster than the market or down 
relative to those stocks.   
 
18:49:10  
 
And by having long and short positions, we were making fairly consistent and good returns -- 
 
John Donvan: 
It worked out. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
 -- for quite a long period of time, yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, we're actually all very happy for you on that point. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, thank you so much. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sure. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
But it didn't exactly work out all the time.  And there was an occasion of a period of about three 
weeks when all the money that the system had made over about three or four years was lost. 
 
John Donvan: 
Oh.  Now we feel bad for you. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  And the reason for that was, in a sense, smart 
technology making us dumb, or at least narrower in our -- in our thought processes.

18:49:56  
 
Because most people who run successful hedge funds, which this was, learn that -- to be very 
cautious about what's called a "crowded trade," a lot of people doing the same thing at the 
same time, and particularly to not use a lot of debt in a crowded trade, because if you have to 
get out and you're forced to sell by the firm that loaned you the money, you're really in trouble.  
Everybody is rushing for the exit at the same time.  So here you had, I mean, our group of guys.  
But it turned out that there were 15 or 20 similar groups of computer scientists at different 
banking firms, all doing more or less the same thing, all looking at their algorithms, all looking at 
their data, and none of them looking at each other.   
 
18:50:49  
 
So they never realized that what they were doing was being in a very, very crowded trade.  And 
when one person overdid it and was forced to sell, it set off a whole domino effect, and 
everybody, including us, lost a lot of money.  So there it is. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, what we do with that? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
What do we do with it?  We know that there's something to be said on both sides of this 
motion, and we should have a debate.

John Donvan: 
All right.  Thank you very much, Bob Rosenkranz.

All right.  Once again, because this is a radio broadcast, I want to ask for a round of applause for 
Bob Rosenkranz and to get us launched. Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
A personal pocket computer wizard so small you can take it with you anywhere.  That sure 
sounds familiar.  But in fact I am quoting from an ad published in a newspaper in Midland, 
Texas, in 1975.  It was advertising the Sharp number 1802 calculator which boasted, in its 
advanced technology, it boasted the broad mathematical abilities of a slide rule.   
 
[laughter] 
 
Well, we've come a long way since then to the point where probably a lot of us don't even 
know what a slide rule is.  But are we smarter now because technology has come so far and put 
a lot more than a slide rule into our pockets?   
 
18:52:52  
 
Or are we so dependent on this wizard that is technology to do things for us that we are losing 
the ability to make our own magic, mentally, socially, politically?  Well, that sounds like the 
makings of a debate, so let's have it.  Yes or no to this statement:  Smart technology is making 
us dumb, a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan.  We are at the Kaufman 
Music Center in New York City.  We have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, 
who will be arguing for and against the motion, "Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb.”  As 
always, our debate goes in three rounds.  And then our live audience here in New York votes to 
choose the winner, and only one side wins.  Let's meet our debaters.  The team arguing for the 
motion, please, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome Nicholas Carr. 
 
[applause] 
 
And, Nick Carr, you are the author of "The Glass Cage:  Automation and Us" as well as "The 
Shallows:  What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains.”  That was a Pulitzer Prize finalist.  In these 
books, Nick, you are warning readers about the danger of our growing reliance on computers.  
So I am wondering do you possess a smartphone?

Well, I resisted for a long time, but about six months ago I finally broke down and bought my

We're still feeling each other out.

Ladies and gentlemen, Nicholas Carr.

And, Nick, who is your partner? 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
My partner is the acclaimed writer and thinker, Andrew Keen. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Andrew Keen, please welcome him. 
 
[applause] 
 
Andrew, you are also arguing for the motion that smart technology is making us dumb.  You are 
an entrepreneur.  You're executive director of FutureCast Salon.  You're host of the web series, 
"Keen On," and you've also written a lot of books including "The Internet Is Not the Answer.”  
However, your critics have chosen some lively language to describe you.  They've described you 
as "a mastodon growling against the warm wind of change." 
 
[laughter] 
 
And your Wikipedia entry once briefly read, "Andrew Keen is an expletive, expletive."

So what do you do to deserve all this hostility?

Genevieve Bell, very, very interesting story.  You're a vice president Intel Fellow and you work in 
Intel's Corporate Strategy Office where your job basically is to worry about the future.  Before 
all of this, however, you were teaching in the anthropology department at Stanford, so our 
question is for all of the humanities and social science majors out there, how does a cultural 
anthropologist end up working at Intel? 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
Well, like all good Australians, I met a man in a bar.

[applause] 
 
David Weinberger, you're also arguing against the motion that "Smart Technology is Making Us 
Dumb.”  You're a senior researcher at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.  
You're at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard -- at the Kennedy School.  You've written a bunch 
of books also including, "Too Big to Know," and "The Cluetrain Manifesto.”  You wrote that back 
in 1999, which was an early book looking at the Internet's effect on business.  And you came up 
with 95 theses.  So have they stood up to the test of time? 
 
David Weinberger: 
Yeah, pretty well.  The most important point that we make -- because it was coauthored -- was 
that the web is actually a social place, although it didn't look like it at the time.  What we got -- 
one of the things we got very wrong was that we didn't know we would have to fight to keep 
the web the way it was. 
 
18:56:56  
 
John Donvan: 
Ah, so you were only a partial visionary?

David Weinberger: 
I am a very shaded if not shady -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to get you out of that.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome David Weinberger. 
Thank you. And these are our teams arguing for and against this motion, "Smart Technology is 
Making Us Dumb.”  Now, this is a debate, and that means there will be winners and losers.  And 
the winners and losers will be determined by a vote of our live audience here in New York.  
Before the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate 
and once again afterwards.  And the team whose numbers have changed the most in 
percentage point terms will be declared our winner.  So let's go to the preliminary vote, if you 
go to those keypads at your seat and take a look at just keys one, two, and three, the only ones 
that are live on that keypad, and if you agree with this motion, push number one.  And if you 
disagree with this motion, push number two.  And if you are undecided, push number three.  
And we will share the result of this vote at the end of the evening, when we also share the 
result of the second vote.   
 
18:58:02  
 
And in between you will have heard the arguments, and judged the quality of the debates, and 
staked your final position -- whether that's different from the first is up to our debaters.  On to

Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb 

Round 1.  Round 1 are opening statements by each debater in turn.  They are uninterrupted.  
They are seven minutes each.  Our motion is "Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb.”  And here 
to make his opening statement in support of the motion, please welcome to the lectern Nick 
Carr.  He is author of "The Glass Cage: Automation and Us," and "The Shallows: What the 
Internet is Doing to Our Brains.”  Ladies and gentlemen, Nick Carr.   
 
[applause] 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
Thank you.  And thank you, John.  We're gathered here tonight to talk about our intelligence, 
and about whether our smartphones, and our apps, and our social media accounts are 
expanding it or eroding it.   
 
18:58:58  
 
Are we more thoughtful now, thanks to our technologies, or less thoughtful? And I think you 
can approach that question from two different angles.  And a little bit later, my colleague, 
Andrew Keen, is going to look at it from a social and cultural angle.  How is the technology 
influencing our collective intelligence? What I'd like to do is talk about it from a very personal, 
individual level.  How is the technology influencing the way our minds work? And now, by now I 
think all of us, if we're honest, know pretty well how we use our gadgets.  We use them 
compulsively.  And the research bears this out.  The average person with a smartphone will pull 
out the phone and look at it about 150 times a day.  And that breaks down to about six minutes 
for your every waking hour.  The average teenager or 20 -- early 20-something-year-old will 
send or receive about 4,000 text messages a month.   
 
18:59:59  
 
And that also breaks down to about one every six minutes.  And when you start to add up all 
the messages, all the notifications, all the alerts, all the Pins, all the Instagrams, all the Google 
searches, and everything else, what you get is a clear picture that we have created, with this 
powerful digital technology, a new environment for ourselves.  An environment of constant 
distraction -- almost perpetual interruption.  Now, that suits the purposes, suits the interests of 
companies like Google and Facebook, because they make more money the more we gobble up 
little bits of information.  But what does it actually do to our brains and how our brains 
operate? To answer that question, I think we have to look at how we transform information, 
which is just the raw material of thinking, into actual knowledge.   
 
19:00:54  
 
And that process hinges on the transfer of that information between two forms of memory.  On 
the one hand, you have your working memory, which is essentially the contents of your 
consciousness at any given moment.  What you're thinking about right now is your working 
memory.  And we know -- what we know about working memory is it has an extremely small

Intelligence Squared: 9 5/14/15 
Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb 

capacity.  You can only hold about two to four pieces of information in your mind, your 
conscious mind, simultaneously.  And then on the other side, you have our long-term memory, 
what we usually refer to as "memory.”  The store of all the facts you know, the experiences 
you've had, the people you recognize.  And this -- if working memory is very small capacity, 
long-term memory has a huge capacity.  You can never actually fill it up.  You can never get to 
the point where you say, "I can't remember anything anymore.”  The key to building 
knowledge, the key to deep intelligence is being able to move incoming information from your 
conscious mind over into your long-term memory.   
 
19:01:56  
 
This is a process called "memory consolidation," and it's through this consolidation that you 
create connections and associations between what you're experiencing now, what you're 
learning now, and what you already know.  And it's those connections and associations 
between the information and the experiences in your mind that form the basis for true 
knowledge.  That is the foundation for conceptual thinking, critical thinking, creative thinking.  
The problem, today, is that we're constantly overloading that small store of our working 
memory.  And this creates a phenomenon -- an actual biological phenomenon called "cognitive 
overload.”  If you think about it, if you can only hold two to four pieces of information in your 
conscious mind, then if you're constantly taking in new information, you have to push the 
existing information out very, very quickly in order to make room.   
 
19:02:53  
 
And what we know is that consolidation, this kind of weaving together of information into 
knowledge, requires attentiveness.  It's only when you attend to something in your working 
memory that you actually transfer it to your working memory and make it part of your 
knowledge.  What we've created, in other words, is an environment that is constantly 
frustrating our mind's ability to create deep knowledge and to think deeply.  Now, we are right 
to celebrate all the great things we get from smart technologies, from the internet.  It's great to 
celebrate the fact that we have access to all this information and all this conversation 
immediately.  But what we too often forget is that information is not knowledge, it's not 
intelligence, and it's certainly not wisdom.  And when we spend all of our time gathering 
information, what gets crowded out is the time to distance yourself from distractions and 
interruptions and think deeply about things, think deeply about the experiences you're having, 
think deeply about the new facts you're learning, think deeply about the conversation you're 
having.   
 
19:04:05  
 
This is the kind of thinking that the internet and smart devices in general, by peppering us with 
messages and little bits of information all day long, is stealing from us.  We're losing that 
contemplative, deep, focused, attentive state of mind that is crucial to the creation of 
knowledge, the creation of intelligence, and deep thinking in general.  So even though we can

celebrate all the great things the internet does, I think we have to be honest with ourselves.  
And I would suggest you look not only to the science and not only to what everybody on the 
stage is going to say, but to your own experience with the technology, how you use it, whether, 
when you want to think deeply, you pull out your smartphone, or you try to distance yourself 
from your smartphone and from your computers.  And by thinking about your own experience, 
I think you'll get a clue to the broader theme of what this technology is doing to us.   
 
19:05:01  
 
And I think, if you're honest with yourself, you'll conclude that indeed our smart technologies 
are making us dumb, and you'll vote for that proposition.  Thank you very much. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Nicholas Carr.   
 
[applause] 
 
And that is the motion, "Smart technology is making us dumb.”  And here to argue against the 
motion, David Weinberger, author of "Too Big to Know: Rethinking Knowledge Now That the 
Facts Aren't the Facts, Experts are Everywhere, the Smartest Person in the Room is the Room.”  
Ladies and gentlemen, David Weinberger. 
 
David Weinberger: 
Thank you.   
 
[applause] 
 
Thank you.  Thank you, Nick and -- so if Nick is right, and our technology is having this physical 
effect on our physical brain, keeping us from being able to form knowledge out of information, 
then why is this -- it seems to me to that this is -- this is the greatest time in human history to 
be somebody who cares about knowledge.   
 
19:05:59  
 
This is -- this is a renaissance of knowledge.  If we take the question, "Is our smart tech making 
us dumb," I want to not even refute that.  I want to ask, why do we keep asking that?  Because 
if "smart" means that we make good decisions, then we are -- new predictive technologies, very 
smart -- enable us to do that.  If being smart means understanding more, we now have from the 
Higgs boson to the Hubble telescope, we have the ability through our smart technology to 
understand more about a universe that's 14 billion years old.  And if "smart" means better at 
our work, then I absolutely, and you absolutely, want your doctor, your auto mechanic, and 
your airplane pilot to have the smartest technology that there is.  So why do we have ask?  I 
think in part it's because of the shock of the new.  And this is very, very new, what's going on.  
Andy Clark is a philosopher who makes a point that we don't know, we don't think in our heads.

19:06:54  
 
We think with things in the world, out in the world.  So a mathematician thinks with chalk on a 
blackboard.  An architect thinks with models in her hands or using a straight edge or something.  
And a meteorologist who is using our old tech, who just has a weather vane is not going to be 
nearly as smart as a meteorologist who's gather data from sensors around the world, big data 
put to use to predict the weather down to the hour.  That's really, really smart.  And it's our 
smart technology that lets us do that.  If Clark is right, and I think he is, that we think of objects 
out in the world, and if those tools change, and if they change radically, then the way that we 
think changes radically, which is why I think we even consider the possibility that our smart tech 
is making us dumb when all the evidence seems to be that in fact we are smarter in the 
important ways than ever.  Another reason perhaps we entertain this notion is that we have a 
natural tendency to think that the technology we grew up with is natural and is good.  But 
that's not the case.   
 
19:07:55  
 
We didn't invent gatekeepers because we said -- in the old world, in a prior world -- we didn't 
invent gatekeepers because we thought it was just a swell idea to vastly limit the amount of 
information and knowledge that we were going to make public, and we didn't say, "You know 
what would be really swell?  Let's create a set of homogenous white guys, and they'll decide 
what makes it through those gates.”  We invented gatekeepers because the old medium, that 
technology of paper, was so limited.  It had gates, and the gates were really, really narrow.  And 
so we needed to have gatekeepers.  But now we don't.  Now the gates are down.  We have this 
huge abundance, and we adopt new strategies for that.  And sometimes it's disconcerting.  One 
of the main strategies is that we skim.  We skim a lot.  That's actually a really adaptive 
technology -- technique for dealing with it.  And it's not even an old technique.  It's a technique 
that we use when we go into an old-fashioned real bookstore and there are thousands of titles, 
and we skim them on the shelves really quickly to find what we're interested -- and that -- so 
we still do that now.   
 
19:09:02  
 
We're doing it online.  And just as then, when we find something that's interesting to us, we are 
able to drill down into it.  We start reading it.  It's -- in this age of constant distraction, we can't 
focus, we're watching seven years of "Game of Thrones," the most complex narrative that 
we've ever seen in our world.  And I'll see you Sunday night.  It's great.  We love this stuff.  Our 
children are reading seven volumes of complex, intricate narrative and characterization.  Our 
universities are turning out experts and scholars who are deep into their topics, deeper than 
ever because they can go that deep because of the internet.  So I don't think the evidence is 
there, despite the brain chemistry, that we are in fact not knowing.  We are knowing more and 
better than ever.

If you think back to the 1980s, for example, you get a newspaper, you'd read the article, you'd 
find something, you'd read an article.  It was really exciting, you wanted to know more.  You 
want -- but you can't because it's 1980.  And all you've got was that rectangle of print.  That's 
what it was like before we had smart technology.  You were just stuck.  It's infuriating even to 
think about at this point.  That's not right. 
 
[laughter] 
 
It's certainly not natural.  So let me give you an example: 1911, with the -- sorry, Britannica, 
Encyclopedia Britannica had its first article on Oliver Goldsmith, the playwright, 6,000 words 
long.  Each new edition, that gets shorter because they've got to cram in more stuff.  By 1994, 
it's down to 1,500 words which means that it's -- the editors of the Britannica, the gatekeepers 
of knowledge and culture, have thrown out 75 percent of what Britannica knows about 
Goldsmith, because that's how paper works.  Wikipedia article, it's 1,400 words, but you've got 
to count all of the -- look into all of the links, decide which ones of those count in the total for 
Goldsmith.   
 
19:11:01  
 
You can do the apples to apples.  It's -- and there will be much more.  And people will disagree 
about what -- which of those links count, which is fine, because in Wikipedia and on the web 
overall, knowledge is no longer crammed into rectangles.  They assume a much more natural 
shape, which is that of a web, which is -- has near infinite capacity.  It enables us to 
accommodate much more complexity of relationships, indefinite complexity, is much bigger 
than any one brain could ever have made.  And we get to see how the knowledge is made, 
which is in many ways very disconcerting.  We see that it's human.  It's a human product.  It's 
full of fallibility, we see the people are arguing, they're adding, they're getting things wrong, 
they're getting things right.  That's how knowledge is made.  That's how knowledge was always 
made.  But now we can see it.  It's in our face.  And that's a truth.  That's a truth about 
knowledge that was always true of knowledge.  But now that we can see it, we're beginning -- 
it's an amazing thing.  We're beginning to invent and discover together new ways of building 
knowledge, of talking together and building knowledge.   
 
19:12:06  
 
This has -- we've never been in a period like this before.  But it may -- it's upsetting because 
now we have to face the truth that knowledge has always, always been a human product and 
always, therefore, subject to and characterized by the fallibility of humans.  So it seems clear to 
me that to argue that our smart tech is making us dumb is not only to be on the wrong side of 
history; in this case, it's to be on the wrong side of evolution.  So I urge you to vote against the 
proposition and to do so emphatically.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, David Weinberger. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And a reminder of what's going on.  We are halfway through the opening round of this 
Intelligence Squared U.S.  debate where our motion is, "Smart technology is making us dumb.”  
You have heard from the first two debaters and now on to the third.  Debating for the motion 
that "Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb.”  Let's welcome to the lectern Andrew Keen.   
 
19:13:08  
 
He is executive director of the Silicon Valley Salon FutureCast and author of the book, "The 
Internet is Not the Answer." 
 
Andrew Keen: 
Well, I've often been accused of being on the wrong side of history, but I love the idea of being 
on the wrong side of evolution. 
 
[laughter] 
 
If my mother was alive, she would particularly appreciate that. 
 
[laughter] 
 
That's why I'm not married either. 
 
[laughter] 
 
So David is clearly a passionate man, I have a great deal of respect and love for him.  We've 
jousted many times before, but I've never heard him quite as effusive of our world.  He talks 
about something he calls a "renaissance of knowledge.”  A renaissance of knowledge, David, 
when was the last time you turned the Internet on? 
 
19:14:02 
 
[laughter] 
 
David Weinberger: 
It's on right now.

Andrew Keen: 
When was the list time you looked at Twitter?  When was the last time you went on Facebook?  
When was the last time you observed the nature of our digital culture, the very culture that 
Nick so brilliantly tore apart in his opening remarks? 
 
[laughter] 
 
You argue that -- and Nick brings up this word, "distance" -- we're talking, of course, in this new 
media, the media that you describe as a "renaissance of knowledge" -- what Nick is describing is 
the end of distance.  Perhaps if we were academics, we would call it, "the death of distance," 
the end of distance.  So we have these devices.  I know this is radio, but on the radio you can 
imagine what I'm waving.  We have the death of distance.  We have a culture of intimacy, of 
personalization.   
 
19:15:01  
 
This is the culture of intimacy and personalization that has replaced what you described as 
"narrow gatekeepers.”  We all become the media in this world.  We all have our devices.  We all 
have our publishing platforms. We can all tell the world what we're thinking, what we're doing, 
where we're going, what we're wearing, unfortunately sometimes what we're not wearing. 
 
[laughter] 
 
We all have these technologies -- Wiki, YouTube, blogging technologies -- that allow us to 
express what Nick called the "death of distance," the end of distance.  It explains our 
contemporary cult of authenticity, this idea that we always have to be true to ourselves.   
 
19:15:54  
 
It's, of course, a manifestation of a particularly corrupted nature of democracy, a world where 
everything is intimate, everything is personalized.  Nick described it in scientific terms I guess as 
not only the end of distance, the end of depth, and the end of objectivity.  Everything, then, in 
this media, in this world of smart technology is personalized.  Everything is intimate.  Everything 
is telling the world what we think.  Everything is confirming what we already think.  So this so-
called smart technology -- I don't know where we get this term.  The person who came up with 
the term, "smart technology," should be spanked, at least metaphorically, because I don't know 
where the word came from.  There's nothing smart about personalized, intimate technology.  It 
simply confirms our misplaced ideal that the world revolves around us.  It's a pre-Copernican 
notion.  And ironically it's technology confirming that.

[laughter] 
 
Technology by definition, as I'm sure some Frankfurt theorist like Walter Benjamin once argued, 
technology is by definition romantic and nostalgic and reactionary.  So don't accuse Nick and I 
of being that.  We are the progressives.  We are the ones looking forward.  It's technologists, or 
people with a belief in the idea of technology as salvation who are reactionaries, they -- they're 
the ones who want to drive us back, like Rousseau, to some idealized community.  So what do 
we have?  We have then a technology of intimacy, which is resulting, in cultural and social 
terms, in a more and more personalized culture, a platform where we tell the world what we're 
doing, what we're thinking.  It represents the disappearance, the death not only of distance but 
of communication.  We struggle more and more to talk to one another.  Sherry Turkle wrote a 
brilliant book called, "Alone Together.”   
 
19:17:57  
 
This technology is indeed making us alone together.  It's a technology not only, as Nick said, of 
distraction, but of atomization, of alienation.  This is Durkheim on steroids.  This is a world of 
profound disorientation and destruction of the community.  So what we have, then, in 
epistemological terms, is the disappearance of that kind of objectivity that Nick talks about.  I 
think David described it -- he thinks this is a good thing, epistemological chaos.  Everyone saying 
everything at the same time, and no one listening to anyone else.   
 
[laughter] 
 
The ultimate -- the ultimate consequence, of course, of this is the selfie.  This is a selfie culture.   
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
  
This is a culture where the ultimate expression is photographing ourselves in front of a 
masterpiece, in front of Auschwitz, in front of someone jumping off the Bay Bridge.   
 
19:18:57  
 
These are true examples of selfie culture.  Meanwhile, what's going on? David celebrates the 
narrow gatekeepers that are being destroyed.  But of course, since we have this so-called smart 
technology, what has happened to those gatekeepers? We're seeing not only the death of 
distance, but the death of newspapers, the death of recorded music, the death of the 
professional creative class, the people who made their living thinking, the people who have 
made their living writing books, the people who made their living writing articles for 
newspapers, the people who made their living taking photographs.  That kind of

professionalism is in crisis.  Some people even believe that the creative professional is a thing of 
the past.  So, what we have is this double whammy.  On the one hand, personalization, 
intimacy, driven more and more into ourselves, into an echo chamber culture, where we never 
listen to anything anyone else is saying, particularly if it dissonates with us.   
 
19:20:08  
 
And on the other hand, the death of a professional culture.  That is why you should believe that 
smart culture -- whoops -- smart technology -- that was Freudian -- smart technology –  
 
[laughter] 
 
-- is certainly making us dumb.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Andrew Keen.   
 
[applause] 
 
And that is the motion: Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb.  And here's our final debater 
against the motion in this opening round.  Please welcome Genevieve Bell.  She's an 
anthropologist, Intel fellow, and Vice President at Intel Corporation.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
Genevieve Bell.

Genevieve Bell: 
Perhaps it's fitting that it falls to a woman and an Australian to rebut that particular moment.   
 
19:20:51  
 
[laughter] 
  
I find myself delightfully, at the end of this conversation, thinking about the proposition, is 
smart technology making us dumb? I think it's probably ironic that we started this debate using 
a smart device to vote on that proposition, and that most of you in the room said you had 
smart technology on your persons, even though you've now disabled it for radio.  When I was 
given the task of taking on this proposition, as someone who did debate in high school -- which 
is a long time ago -- I was struck by the impulse to want to deconstruct the question.  It's an 
anthropological approach too, right? And ask "What is smart technology?" Echoing Andrew's 
concern of what on earth that might mean.  What does “dumb” mean? Is smart/dumb the only 
binary pair that we could have, and is dumb necessarily, as an anthropologist, I might want to 
ask, a bad thing? I mean, clearly we're putting a set of cultural and moral values around 
dumbness that are interesting.  Smart technology is now being described as romantic,

progressive, reactionary, a rectangle, and a gatekeeper, all of which is an interesting set of a 
baggage to put on a phone, the Internet, algorithms, the internet of things, and big data.   
 
19:21:53  
 
Nonetheless, we have done that.  So, David said to me, "No, Genevieve, don't deconstruct the 
argument.”  So I'm taking his advice.   
 
[laughter] 
 
I am, however, going to want to suggest that smart technology has made us smart in some 
unexpected ways.  It's made us more responsive.  It's made us more engaged.  And in the case 
of both Andrew and I, it's made us more enraged and I'm not necessarily convinced that's a bad 
thing.  So, how might I go about proving that? Well, I think there's a couple of places you'd look 
to.  And many of them are outside of this room, and Manhattan, and outside of the United 
States.  Smart technology makes us smart and it makes us safer.  If you were to look, in the last 
year, I can pull you examples from all over the world.  In many African countries and on the 
Indian subcontinent, mobile phones and text messages are used by governments to send out 
health warnings and preventative health messages.  When the Ebola outbreak was taking place, 
messages were sent on smartphones to tell people how to handle themselves, their 
communities, and the bodies that they were encountering.  Hardly dumb, right? In Australia, 
where I come from, all the volunteer fire services, which is how we keep ourselves safe in the 
fire season, use a geo-located app service that sends out notifications to Australians to tell 
them there's a bush fire near them, to tell them what to do in a high-fire danger day, which isn't 
always obvious. 
 
19:23:06 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
And how to think about being safer and ultimately smarter about how we inhabit a dangerous 
landscape.  In the United States, you have the Amber alert, something I'm sure many of you 
hope to never see on your telephones.  But when you do, you know what to do.  It's about 
making a community and the kids in it hopefully safer and ultimately making all of us smarter 
about danger.  And it will be hard to argue with what’s happened in Nepal over the last three 
and a half weeks as people have mobilized all sorts of technology to bring both relief and 
comfort to a community that was clearly struggling.  In all of those cases, is smart technology 
making us dumber?  I hardly think so.  And if you were to move further out from that frame and 
think about cultural knowledge, we talked a lot about intelligence, we talked a lot about book 
learning.  But let's think a little bit about cultural knowledge.   
 
19:23:49  
 
I'm the child of an anthropologist.  I grew up with indigenous people in Australia.  I spent a lot 
of time in indigenous communities, and it's been fascinating to watch over the last 20 years as

those communities have embraced new technologies to do old things.  The Ngadjuri with whom 
my family have worked for the last 20 years, used the internet to tell their stories.  They like the 
fact that newspapers are being archived because they can use the stories in those about their 
colonial contact and argue about how to regain their land.  The Diri and the Kukuda [spelled 
phonetically] are using IOT sensors to combine traditional knowledge about climate with state-
based knowledge about climate change to think about how to occupy their land better.  And 
the Anangu in central Australia have an electronic medical records system that is a marvel of 
the world and has changed the health outcomes in that community.  Is smart tech, in those 
instances, making those communities dumber?  I hardly think so.  And is it about a vacuum and 
people just talking to each other?  I don't think that's the right way to think about it, either.  
Moving closer to home, at Intel, we're deeply concerned about diversity in the tech community, 
about diversity in STEM education.  And one of our challenges frequently is to convince young 
women and ethnic minorities that there's room for them inside the sciences.   
 
19:24:56  
 
And one of the ways you do that is by telling the stories of people who've been there before.  
Finding the stories of women pioneers and under-represented minorities who were pioneers 
used to be difficult.  It's nice to be in New York for me.  I get to go visit Judy Chicago's dinner 
table at the Brooklyn Museum, and I think about how hard it was for her to reclaim all of those 
women's names and how much easier it is to do it today.  My Twitter feed just recently brought 
me the name of Sharla Boheim [spelled phonetically] who actually was the original lead name 
on pocket -- packet simulation technology.  You don't need to know what it is, but it's the 
foundation of the internet.  And she was involved.  Until quite recently, people didn't know 
that.  So is using smart technology to tell our stories and tell them widely and bring more 
people into the conversation making us dumb?  I certainly hope not, because it's something I 
participate in regularly.  And almost last but by no means least, let's tackle the notion of 
community and citizenship.  Andrew brought it up.  Let's take it on a little bit more seriously.  
What have we used smart technology for from the last 18 months to think about notions of 
citizenship beyond the United States and within it?   
 
19:25:55  
 
Were the students who were protesting at Mong Kok in Hong Kong say that smart technology 
was making them dumb?  I don't think so.  Would -- and I'm never going to get this man's name 
right, so I apologize in advance -- but would Feidin Santana think that he was doing something 
dumb when he took out his camera phone and recorded a policeman shooting someone in 
South Carolina?  And we watched the video rocket around America and drive yet a further 
conversation about race and violence, and what it means to be a citizen?  We can dismiss 
hashtag activism -- such a great phrase -- as being a sort of a fleeting thing, right?  Whether it's 
#blacklivesmatter, #notallmen, #SOSblackAustralia from my hometown.  But truthfully the use 
of technology to propel conversations about citizenship is hardly new.  A photograph made a 
huge difference in how we talked about the Vietnam War. The radio and vinyl records, which

are making a comeback, I'll have you know, helped distribute the word of Martin Luther King.  
And the suffragettes really liked a good typewriter.   
 
19:26:54 
 
So is smart technology in those cases making us dumb?  I don't think so.  Does it mean we still 
have a lot of work to do as citizens?  Absolutely.  And lest I end on a depressing note, because I 
realize being told you have more work is depressing, let me just reflect briefly on something 
else.  Smart technology is also in our everyday lives.  And some of those things we may not 
think about as making us smart, but they're certainly changing, I would argue, for the better 
personhood.  Here's my last example:  Online dating, because you should end on a good note.  
When I was in India doing fieldwork many years ago, a place that had been embracing this 
technology for a long time, a woman said to me, "Getting a husband is just a database 
problem." 
 
 [laughter] 
 
And she said the matrimonial time -- matrimonial classified section of the Times of India 
changed everything for us because the database got bigger.  So, let us imagine, from changing 
ideas of citizenship and safety, to ideas of romance to ideas of what it means to be in the world, 
it's really hard, I imagine, for any of us to sit in this room and to agree to the proposition that 
smart technology is making us dumb.  So along with David, I think you should emphatically vote 
against it. Thank you. 
 
19:27:56  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Genevieve Bell.  And that is our motion:  Smart technology is making us dumb.  And 
that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S.  debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
Now we move on to round two.  And round two is where the debaters address one another 
directly and take questions from me and from you and our live audience here in New York.  The 
motion is this:  Smart technology is making us dumb.  We have two debaters argue strenuously 
for the motion.  They have made the argument that the new technology -- and we all know 
what we're talking about because it's in our pockets -- is creating a new environment of 
constant distraction and perpetual interruption which leads to a kind of cognitive overload, 
which ultimately diminishes attentiveness, and as a result, accumulation and use of knowledge 
suffers.  They also make the case that smart technology creates a false ideal of intimacy which 
in itself is actually devoid of communication, and in that sense, harmful to the culture overall.

Intelligence Squared: 20 5/14/15 
Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb 

The team arguing against the motion, Genevieve Bell and David Weinberger, argue that thanks 
to smart technology, we are living in a renaissance of knowledge, that being smart means being 
able to understand the world better, to be better at our work than ever before.  They hail the 
fact that the gatekeepers of knowledge are on the run and possibly in some cases dead.  And 
they talked about, in general, the expansion of cultural knowledge, particularly in communities 
who previously didn't have ways to connect or had a voice, and that the technology gives them 
those voices.  So I hear -- we've had many, many layers of this argument already brought out, 
both in terms of putting this in a hardware/software term, but we've also looked at the impact 
of the technology both on the individual and then on the culture.  So I think we need to take 
some of those in turn.  And I want to start more with the argument that was made about the 
impacts on the individual and his ability to gather and use knowledge.   
 
19:30:00 
 
And it sounds to me -- I want to take this to David Weinberger.  You have celebrated the vast 
expansion of the amount of information out there.  But I -- it seems to me that your opponents 
are saying that information is not knowledge, and that there's an important distinction.  I want 
to see if you take that point or would refute it: 
 
David Weinberger: 
Well, on the one hand, I am not happy with the metaphorical use -- and yes, I am goading you, I 
think, Nick -- the metaphorical use of information, knowledge, and wisdom.  This is a pyramid 
that was constructed that was -- somebody came up with, Russell Ackoff, I think, in the 1990s.  
And it's become canon that I think that it is not -- it's a nice metaphor, but it's actually a wrong 
metaphor.  The idea is, it's a pyramid, right?  Many of you have seen this.  Businesses put up, 
like every hour that diagram is drawn on some business law somewhere.  Data information 
knowledge, wisdom.  It's a pyramid because the idea is that knowledge is a matter -- we think 
knowledge is a matter of filtering out information.   
 
19:31:03 
 
So we start with broad-based data.  That gets filtered out.  What's worthy information is -- in 
data becomes information and so on up the path.  And certainly wisdom does not work that 
way.  Wisdom doesn't make sense in that if you think about it for a moment.  And I also don't 
think knowledge works that way either.  Knowledge is not a filtering of information.  In fact, let 
me -- [unintelligible] the information itself is very suspect. 
 
John Donvan: 
 -- take it to your opponent that he actually refutes -- he refutes the assertion that knowledge 
and information are different, which is -- on which your argument hinges.  But just having a 
bunch of stuff is not such a great advantage. 
 
Nicholas Carr:

Intelligence Squared: 21 5/14/15 
Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb 

I fundamentally disagree that the concepts of information, knowledge and wisdom are mere 
metaphors that were invented in the 1990s.  That's insane.  This is -- but this is fundamental to 
our understanding of what it means to be a thoughtful, you know, intelligent person, is the 
ability to gather lots of information, to be aware of things going on.   
 
19:31:59 
 
But then the crucial part is stepping back from the flow, taking that information and creating 
personal knowledge in your own mind.  So there is a fundamental distinction between grabbing 
stuff online, between checking your Twitter feed or your Facebook notifications, and actually 
raising that up through connections, through contacts, through cultural knowledge. 
 
John Donvan: 
You do not dispute your opponent's, Nick, that there is, at minimum, a whole lot more 
information available to individuals than there used to be. 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
Absolutely, there's a whole lot more information. 
 
John Donvan: 
The question is whether it's meaningful. 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
The question is, how do we think? 
 
John Donvan: 
David Weinberger. 
 
David Weinberger: 
Again, so it would be insane to say that we invented knowledge in the 1990s, somewhere 
[unintelligible].  The diagram in which we think that this is how the filtration process works I 
think is fundamentally misleading, that knowledge is not a filtering of information.   
 
19:32:55  
 
It's a social process -- sorry, the epistemological chaos that -- it is somewhat chaotic.  It's a 
social process in which we engage with one another.  We -- knowledge is based in large part 
upon social-- relationships and makes social relationships.  The computer based model of the 
brain that you and most of our culture accepts I think is highly suspect.  And if we look past 
going -- you know, scanning down your Facebook feed to see what's new and think about the 
times in which we actually do form knowledge, this new ecosystem, which I totally agree with 
you, we now have, is in fact spectacularly good for the formation of knowledge.

Let's bring in Andrew Carr [sic].  Do you want to respond to any of that? 
 
Andrew Keen: 
Well, I don't even like this word, "information." 
 
[laughter] 
 
I would prefer to use the word, "data." 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm sorry.  I mispronounced your name.  It's Keen. 
 
Andrew Keen: 
Keen, okay. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah, because I've got the team of Keen and Carr. 
 
Andrew Keen: 
That's a lot of data or information. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah.

[laughter] 
 
It's -- the alliteration just throws me. 
 
Andrew Keen: 
Yeah, I'm always known as Andrew Carr on Wikipedia.

I think that what we have in our age of the smart machine, of smart technology is an avalanche 
of data.  And I tend to think that we even have to distinguish data from information.  And I 
certainly -- you know, I bow down to Nick in this area from a scientific and an epistemological 
point of view.  But this overpowering nature of data is troubling in all sorts of ways.  And 
perhaps most troubling of all -- Nick pointed to this -- was while we're all drowning in data, 
most of it extremely irrelevant at best -- inane, vulgar -- a tiny handful of Silicon Valley 
companies, most notably Google and Facebook, are making fortunes out of that data, not 
because it's correct, not because it has any value to civilization, not because it's solving 
problems in Africa, but because they're selling advertising around it.

19:35:04  
 
So there is a double vulgarity here, and I would much rather talk about a big data economy than 
an information economy. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me bring it to Genevieve Bell.  And your opponent just said that -- that we are drowning in 
data, which would appear to try to set on its heels your argument that the plethora of stuff that 
we now have is in itself a good thing, because it's too much. 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
Well, I mean, I would make the argument that some of that data has been extraordinary in 
what it has revealed.  I mean, you know, let's think about Snowden and Chelsea Manning.  Let's 
think about the Sony leaks.  I mean, you know, whether we can argue about the legality of 
those, but the data that they generated revealed things about the contours of the world writ 
large and the world writ small, and made clear all manner of things that we might want as 
citizens, as human beings, as women to argue about. 
 
19:35:58  
 
John Donvan: 
But what's the -- 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
But the data they generated was data about the incredible surveillance apparatus that is built 
around smart technology deployed by the government. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
Oh indeed. Oh indeed. 
 
[applause] 
 
We're not having a debate about the morality of surveillance.  We are having a debate about 
whether smart technology makes us dumb.  And I think, you know, the argument there is not 
about surveillance, but about, "Does the prevalence of data always mean we are drowning?" 
 
John Donvan: 
Nick Carr, David Weinberger said that skimming is good, and he said we do it naturally.  We go 
into libraries and we skim and we select very quickly, and so he -- a direct challenge to your 
argument that this -- that this distraction that you talked about that the Internet represents is

Nicholas Carr: 
We read in different ways, and they're all valuable.  On way of reading is skimming.  If you open 
a magazine or newspaper, you do a lot of skimming.  But then, particularly when you have a 
book or a news -- printed newspaper or something in front of you, you also -- when something 
interests you, you move to a much deeper form of reading where you're not skimming.   
 
19:37:03  
 
You're actually reading.  You're going line by line.  And what research into how people read 
when they're looking at their phones or their computer shows is that skimming becomes the 
default, the dominant form of reading.  And, in fact, you -- if you look at the research, the 
researchers talk about the F pattern by which they mean that people -- when they -- when 
people read on a computer screen, they go across the first couple of lines of text all the way, 
and then their eyes drift down the margin a little bit.  And then they go about halfway across 
the text, and then their eyes just drift down the rest of the margin, so it forms this F pattern.  
And then you click, and you go somewhere else.  So skimming is fine in context.  Better and 
more important is actually reading deeply, whether it's fiction or nonfiction or anything.  That's 
when you get deeply engaged.  That's when you learn stuff, and that's the kind of reading that 
we're losing, thanks to our smart technologies. 
 
19:37:55  
 
John Donvan: 
And the evidence that we're losing it is what?  Because your opponents were talking about an 
enormous amount of reading they were talking about, an ability actually to process, even if it's 
Game of Thrones, very complex plots, that, in fact, the mind isn't dying because the argument is 
-- 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
I don't think we're arguing that the mind is dying.  And, fortunately, we used to be -- you know, 
used to get involved in "War and Peace.”  And now we get involved in "Game of Thrones.”  And 
that's all fine.  And that's all good.  The question is, on balance, is this making us dumber or 
smarter? And I think there is, at this point, a lot of research.  There's a great study that came 
out of Stanford, where the researchers got two groups of people.  One group spends a lot of 
time online, a lot of time multi-tasking.  One group didn't.  They gave them six basic, 
fundamental tests of cognitive function.  The heavy multi-taskers did worse on all six tests.  And 
one of the most revealing tests was how well people are able to distinguish important 
information from trivia.  And on that test, the heavy multi-taskers, heavy users of smart 
technology, did very poorly.

And what the researchers theorized is that what happens is we train ourselves not to pay 
attention to what's important, but simply to pay attention to what's new.  So, when your phone 
goes off, when it buzzes, whatever, it can be the most trivial thing in the world, but that's what 
grabs your -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
-- attention. 
 
John Donvan: 
But let me -- 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
And we begin to lose that fundamental ability to even think about what we should be thinking 
about. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  So, Genevieve Bell, you're approaching, as we know, as an anthropologist.  And we want 
to come to that part of the discussion shortly.  But the description that Nicholas gives, from the 
sort of lab -- the bench science on this, do you find it concerning? Do you -- first of all, do you 
dispute it or concede it? And in either case, do you find it concerning? 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
I'm not sure I'm willing to dispute it, but I'm willing to suggest that, you know, we're at a very -- 
it may not feel like it to many of us in this room -- Nick obviously the exception, having only had 
a smartphone for six months.  This technology is still relatively new.  It doesn't always feel that 
way, but a lot of this technology has been in mainstream adoption in the United States for less 
than a decade.   
 
19:39:57  
 
And I think, you know, one of the things that's very clear is that the first studies that were done 
about the impact of the Internet on our sociality, on our personalities, have long since been 
eclipsed by [unintelligible] -- I'm thinking about that Sara Kiesler did at CMU, some of the other 
pieces of work, where some of the earlier assessments we made about how technology would 
affect people have now been proven, when you have more data, to be very different.  And then 
I think the second question is, I am also interested in what those studies look like beyond the 
United States, and about what it means to not keep reducing smart technology down to 
Facebook, Google, Twitter, and a phone, when in fact, we know that the technologies that are 
in people's worlds that are smart are far beyond that.  And the impact of those, I think, is much 
more complex.

John Donvan: 
Andrew Keen? Do you want to respond to that point? Because again, you're more on the 
cultural topic, but I'm -- 
 
Andrew Keen: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- interested to see how you would process that. 
 
Andrew Keen: 
I'm very suspicious of Genevieve's sort of argument about the non-Western world.   
 
19:40:58  
 
We always hear this about these new technologies.  We always hear, "Well, this is going to 
change everything.  This is going to empower aboriginal people.  This is going to solve poverty.  
This is going to allow people to develop their economies.”  And as we know, from the way in 
which they -- when it comes to politics, this technology was, as Genevieve says, is empowering, 
is liberating.  But look at the Arab Spring.  The Arab Spring was embraced by the digital 
utopians, because it was supposedly throwing off autocracy.  It was supposedly doing away 
with the totalitarianism in the Middle East.  But what we've seen after the collapse of the Arab 
Spring is more anarchy.  And what we see with this technology is its failure to actually create 
coherent political movements because of the death of distance, because of this intimacy and 
personalization.   
 
19:40:58  
 
We saw the same, indeed, with the Occupy movement in the United States.  It's like a firework.  
It explodes.  And when you look up in the sky, it's wonderful for about 10 seconds.  And then it 
goes away.  There's no consequence.  There's no depth.  The very depth that Nick talks about in 
epistemological terms is also missing in social and political terms. So I think we have to be 
extremely careful to say, "Well, all this technology is going to change everything for the next 2 
or 3 billion people who are about to experience this technology." 
 
John Donvan:

Genevieve Bell: 
Well, as you full well know, Andrew -- as am I.  And I was very careful not to say that.  I'm not 
talking about the liberation -- 
 
Andrew Keen: 
Well, you did talk about aboriginals. 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
I talked about aborigines.  I didn't say it was liberating them.  I said the technology was being 
used to do things that made people's communities function in ways that they liked.  I was 
arguing that it wasn't making them dumb.  I want to be really clear here, right? This is not a 
cyber-utopian argument.   
 
19:42:55  
 
This is an argument that says there are things that technology can do that don't necessarily 
have to be about liberating everyone or changing everything for it not to be making us stupid.  
That it's completely possible to imagine a world in which people use technology to enhance 
their daily practices, to support traditional culture, to find ways to marry traditional culture and 
science that doesn't necessarily have to be -- what was your phrase?  Oh, liberating the next 3 
billion people.

Andrew Keen: 
We still need to come up with a definition of smart technology, because at what point is a tap 
smart technology?  My assumption in this debate -- and I think although the discourse around 
it, is that the smart technology of network society, it's digital technology.  And in that sense, 
you know, David's arguments about the web I think were flatware [spelled phonetically]. 
 
19:44:03 
 
So I do think we have to be careful because, after all, everything is technology.  You know, this 
pen is technology.  The -- a water pipe is technology, a bathroom is technology.  I'm not arguing 
against those things.

smart technology bringing together people forcing political action, ultimately leading to their 
liberation and freedom, or at least the impulse in that direction.   
 
19:44:55  
 
And now it doesn't look so good.  I want to sort of get your reaction to that.  Does Arab Spring 
represent the failure of the promise, or does the Arab Spring reveal the false promise of smart 
technology? 
 
David Weinberger: 
I'm not sure who made the promises.  I'm also not entirely sure what this has to do with being 
dumb.  But -- or smart. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, I think it does in a sense that we're making broader claims about the -- about whether 
cultures are getting -- are being raised up. 
 
David Weinberger: 
Okay.  So -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
David Weinberger: 
I do think there's some disagreement on the panel about what we're talking about in terms of 
culture.  Andrew.  So -- I’m not sure what promise was made.  I don't know who makes 
promises and so forth.  But the internet proved itself not only to be a superb tool for organizing, 
for organizing people without a leader, which is a pretty remarkable thing.  This was a 
leaderless organization.   
 
19:45:56  
 
It also, I noticed, from talking with people from Tunisia, they credit, at least in part, the internet 
with giving them the idea of freedom, the sense that they can have a voice.  They should have a 
voice.  They are -- it is their right as citizens because they can do it on the net.  Why can't they 
do it in public for their government?  And I will use the word; that is empowering.  And so they 
use the internet in a complex environment.  They organize, they, in some senses, in some 
places, they won, and then larger forces came.  It turns out that what we now know is that the 
internet is really great at leaderless organization, but doesn't necessarily always lead to the 
next stage of governing.  So that --

Nicholas Carr: 
I think the internet is a communication platform.  And you can communicate good stuff, and 
you can communicate bad stuff.  You can communicate healthcare information, as Genevieve 
said, or you can be ISIS and send out YouTube videos of beheadings as a recruitment tool.   
 
19:46:57  
 
You can -- you can organize antigovernment protests or you can be the government using the 
technology to track those protesters and throwing -- throw them in jail.  So I don't think you can 
-- I don't think you can leap to the assumption that even as a basic communication platform this 
is something that is naturally or inclined to be a good thing that raises people up and lets them 
think deeper thoughts.  I think it can do both things, as all communication platforms do.  And I 
think we really have to -- have to look at what -- how the technology influences what we do 
with the communications, how it influences our relationship to our thinking and to one 
another.  And there, I think the picture is much darker. 
 
John Donvan: 
David Weinberger. 
 
David Weinberger: 
So, yes, internet is just a communication platform, but it's not just a communication platform.  
It has particular, as they say, affordances, things that it's good at.  And so if you're on the 
internet, you are very likely going to learn some things beyond that you can communicate.   
 
19:47:56  
 
You will learn that you can talk.  You can speak.  The entire world can listen.  This is so different 
than it was 20 years ago.  Anybody anywhere can talk and the entire world can listen.  They 
may not, but they can.  It is an environment where you can speak without permission, and it's 
an environment that is linked.  Links are like the new punctuation.  They're -- instead of putting 
a full stop or a half stop, you put a connection.  This type of new punctuation is transformative 
in our idea of how things go together and our agency in doing so.  So I don't think it's just a 
communication platform, and I think that you can generally learn some things just by using the 
internet.  It does help shape some of those ideas. 
 
John Donvan: 
Andrew Keen, go ahead. 
 
Andrew Keen: 
I think, again, we have to be very, very careful here, David.  You said the internet allows people 
to talk as if somehow in the pre-internet age, before computers, people couldn't talk.

It's that kind of argument which I think puts the digital camp in trouble, because the reality is, is 
that we always talked.  The digital platform certainly does enable us to talk.  It certainly enables 
us to get a global audience.  But the reality, of course -- and McLuhan came out with this in his 
ironically termed "Global Village," is the ironic nature of the internet is it's not global.  The 
ironic nature of the internet, okay, the wires are -- everywhere you go, it's the same -- it's the 
same technology and everyone's on the same platform.  But the reality is study after study has 
shown -- as shown in an excellent book called "The Filter Bubble," the reality is that we're 
talking to fewer and fewer people.  So if anything, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to fall into 
your dystopian/ Utopian trap.  But if anything, we're talking less now than we were before the 
invention of the internet. 
 
19:49:58  
 
John Donvan: 
David Weinberg. 
 
David Weinberger: 
So, Andrew, you have to hear the complete sentence.  What I said is it enables us to talk, and 
the entire world to listen.  And that is new.  And as I said, not everybody in the world will -- let 
me -- 
 
Andrew Keen: 
[unintelligible] not listening.  That's the point.  I mean, you could argue, if I shout loud enough, 
the entire world could hear. 
 
David Weinberger: 
Then you should have listened to the second sentence after that, in which I said, it doesn't 
mean that anybody is listening.  So yes, filter bubble --

somehow.  And, yes, Andrew, of course, not everybody hears what you're saying.   
 
19:50:59  
 
But compared to the prior media regime, the ability for -- which was basically, if you wanted 
people to hear you, you put it -- you wrote a letter to the editor, and you're lucky if it got 
printed.  And if it did, it went to your community.  The ability for people to talk and to say 
uninteresting -- things that are interesting to them, but maybe not interesting to you -- and that 
matters.  The ability of people to talk and address the world is new, and it is -- it is

But I just wanted to have -- they were -- I asked them to wait, so I'm fulfilling my pledge to them 
to talk. 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
I'll be brief.  Genevieve talked about, you know, that the internet may be making us dumb or 
that smart technology may be making us dumb now, or at least what's the evidence suggests 
but at some future, it'll make us smart.  David talks about the fact that we -- that anybody can 
communicate anything to anyone else now.   
 
19:52:03  
 
But what he doesn't talk about is what actually people use the internet for, for communicating.  
We're not all broadcasting these deep thoughts.  We're sending out links to silly videos.  We're 
going -- spending huge amounts of time on Facebook.  We're spending lots of time on Twitter, 
sending Snapchats.  We have to -- in order to answer the question before us, we have to look at 
how this technology has actually evolved, how people are actually using it now, not some 
Utopian dream of how it can be used, and how that reflects on the depth of the thought it is 
inspiring in us. 
 
John Donvan: 
Genevieve Bell, I think it's just been handed to you. 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
I think it has.  And I absolutely agree with you, Nick.  And I think the phrase that is a dead 
giveaway to me is, it's not like they're saying anything interesting, which you muttered before 
he cut you off earlier.   
 
19:52:51  
 
The notion that anything interesting is telling, I said in my opening remarks that one of the 
challenges I have here is, what is dumb and what is lying underneath that judgment?  And I 
think sometimes using dumb is a way of talking about some other things.  It's -- buried in that is 
notions about what is appropriate discourse, what is sufficiently merit-worthy, what is -- and, 
you know, this is a place where, truthfully, you know, although David and I both fundamentally 
and violently disagree that smart devices are making us dumb, we do come at this from two 
very different positions.  And mine is very much about saying, "Listen, there are lots of things 
that people do with technology in this current moment that may not rise to the bar of tenured 
faculty and book writers.”  That doesn't necessarily mean it's dumb.  Is everyone who's on 
Facebook dumb?  That makes everyone in this room dumb -- is -- I'm willing to bet, and if not 
you, then your children.

And while you may say many things about your children, you are not yet willing to imagine they 
are dumb.  Does it mean that every single one of us who uses GPS because we're directionally 
challenged is an idiot?   
 
19:53:55  
 
Does it mean the fact that I like Microsoft to spellcheck me make me dumb?  I don't think so.  
So there's sort of something in there about what is the judgment lurking beneath "dumb" that 
requires just a little bit of scrutiny. 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to audience questions now.  And right -- sir, if you -- I'm looking right now -- if you

question. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Sure, my name is Rahul.  And my question is really about the kind of things that Genevieve was 
talking about.  If we agree that the more data points we have makes us -- allows us to have 
smarter decisions, regardless of how banal or mundane those decisions are, because the 
Internet and smartphones give us more data points, doesn't that necessarily make us smarter in 
the decisions we're making, even if it's about knowing more about cute cats, but we're smarter 
about knowing about cute cats?

I think actually in theory that should be how things work, but as we've talked about with filter 
bubbles that actually what happens is people tend to go out and don't expose themselves to 
lots of different points of view and don't gather lots of different data points.  We tend to go 
out, and we read and look at those kind of points of view that reinforce our own biases.  So

often it's not -- the dream was that we'd use the Internet to challenge ourselves.  In fact, what 
most people do is they go out and find stuff that confirms their existing biases, and that makes 
those biases even stronger. 
 
Andrew Keen: 
And let me just jump on your question in terms of -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Andrew Keen. 
 
Andrew Keen: 
-- this data points, this idea that knowledge is simply join the dots or join the data dots.  It's 
more complex than that.  As Nick is saying, what we're losing is the subtlety, the depth, the 
sophistication of thought.  In an odd way perhaps we're becoming like our machines.  But that 
in an odd way as well makes us dumber than we once were.

So, to Nick's point that we're -- we use the net to talk about things that aren't interesting, I 
think it's actually an argument against language itself, because most of what we use language 
for is to talk about things that are not broadly interesting.  We seek out sites that we agree with 
in part because we fall prey to this filter bubble and confirmation bias thing, but also because 
when we want to -- that's how understanding works.  When we want to understand something, 
we go -- to understand it is to fit it into our context.  That's maybe a bug in how understanding 
works, but it is how understanding works.  So it actually makes sense when you have a question

Internet, and the search engines, but what about the devices themselves?  I see a whole young 
generation of my grandchildren and their peers growing up with their -- and using their thumbs 
instead of their brains.  And almost -- it's like a pacifier for young children.  And so how can that 
possibly really produce young adults or teenagers who are smarter?  I mean, how can it do 
anything but hold back the brain from achieving its full potential?

Let me take it to Nick Carr first.

Sure.  I think they're -- I think the negative effects influence people of all ages, 80-year-olds as

know their brains are in the process of being formed.

experiences, interacting with the world in lots of different ways, playing with clay, doing -- you 
know, interacting with people face-to-face.  And what we're doing often with a -- with even 
ever younger children is putting more and more of their attention on screens.  And we're seeing 
this in schools, we're seeing it out of schools.  And I think  it's hard to conclude, from what we 
know about child development, that kind of giving this more and more constrained way of 
interacting with the world is going to produce broader-minded, more curious children.  I think 
it's going to have the opposite effect. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me take the question to the other side.  Now, you're allowed to applaud.  It's –

John Donvan: 
Genevieve -- 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
-- there are a couple of things that run through that, right? Is we have a persistent anxiety 
about the impact of new technologies on our children.  This one has a particular kind of 
visceral-ness to it.  I'm willing to bet many of your parents worried about the impact of radio, 
rock and roll, television on all of us.  The jury is in some ways still out on rock and roll, 
obviously, but not the rest.   
 
[laughter] 
 
19:59:06  
 
And there's something about why it is that we worry about technology and children in 
particular.  And I think, you know, there are reasons to suggest -- and Nick's right on this -- that 
a diversity of experiences is a good thing.  The challenge, however, here, is also beyond the kind 
of notion that every child is born with a smart device in one hand, and only a thumb in the 
other.  The reality is that in lots of places in the world, kids are not using new technology.  In 
lots of places in the world, there are cultures about how technology is introduced into children 
that suggests that, you know, you may be disadvantaged because there are other places -- if 
that's your fear -- that this is not happening.  But I think it's a hard one to argue, right, is to say, 
"Is, you know, technology pernicious and bad for children?" Well, it's an argument that's been 
rehearsed for nearly 200 years.  And I think all of you are living proof in the room that rock and 
roll didn't rot your brains. 
 
19:59:53  
 
John Donvan: 
Well, maybe we would all be a lot smarter if that rock and roll thing hadn't happened. 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
Well, you know -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- fair point.  We could always go look for some countries that didn't have it and see what the 
comparative state is.

Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb 

Oh, sure. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thanks. 
 
Female Speaker: 
I was just wondering if the answer would be different for the sciences and math versus -- I 
mean, we've been talking about -- a lot about reading, and on the Internet, and things like that.  
And then you were talking about the particle collider.  And so, I wonder if it would be two 
different -- are there -- do you have two different answers for the different disciplines? 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
No.  I don't.  I mean, I think deep thinking is deep thinking, whether you apply it to a poem or to 
a scientific problem.  I do think -- I mean, and that's not to say there aren't good things about 
being able to exchange information very quickly.  I think science advances a lot -- in many cases, 
by being able to exchange information quickly.   
 
20:00:55  
 
So that's a good thing about the Internet.  But you come back to the point that we are having 
more and more trouble screening out distractions and interruptions, and really thinking deeply 
about something, which means concentrating our focus and concentrating our mind.  And 
that's every bit as important to scientific discovery as it is to the humanities, right? 
 
Andrew Keen: 
And I think it's important to add that both science -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Andrew Keen. 
 
Andrew Keen: 
-- and the humanities are victims of this technology.  So, supporters of the smart technology 
often point to Wikipedia and say, "Well, Wikipedia is the example of how smart technology 
works.”  But all the research on Wikipedia indicates that the content there isn't very reliable.  
So, for example, when it comes to the medical information on Wikipedia, a board of doctors 
who researched this found that nine out of 10 articles on Wikipedia about medical were 
inaccurate, which is obviously particularly troubling.   
 
20:01:53  
 
So, I think we have to be careful to believe that somehow, smart technology generates reliable, 
scientific information, but not information about the humanities.  I think it's --

Listen -- 
 
Andrew Keen: 
-- unreliable in both sense. 
 
John Donvan: 
David Weinberger. 
 
David Weinberger: 
So, if I understand your question correctly, if we look into the sciences, we see that smart 
technology has enabled a rapid advance of those sciences.  What we're doing now would be 
absolutely impossible without the Internet.  And not simply because of the rapid 
communication.  It's really important -- but also because it has enabled -- things have grown up 
that enabled sophisticated collaboration.  Management of gigantic multinational projects.  It's 
enabled a type of iterative knowledge as well, in which ideas are put forward, and then iterated 
on in public.  And this is actually a pretty new form of knowledge.  It can be done at scale.  The 
Internet is enabling open access, which is the movement that -- the idea that scientific research 
and research in the humanities, academic research should be available for free to anybody 
online.   
 
20:03:01  
 
This is peer-reviewed, but not put it into academic journals that can charge 20 or $25,000 for a 
subscription, which is driving our libraries into great despair.  And so, this ecosystem that Nick 
refers to, which I think is the right word, is in fact one that is extremely -- is enabling science to 
proceed, and research in general can proceed at tremendous pace and enabling it to get deeper 
and deeper and more and more complex.  I just don't know the people, Nick, who don't think 
deeply, who don't have a moment to think, who are distracted by their thumbs, that they don't 
-- who?  I don't meet them.  I see so much more deep thinking out in the world than I --

I would like to readdress -- and perhaps this is exceeding the scope of the argument about

That sort of gets to the heart of the question, at least whether, in fact, these devices are 
extensions of our brains that support us or whether they are just things that are turning our 
brains into hard drives.  I like the question.  I want to take it to Nick Carr first. 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
I think there's no question that if you need to get an answer to a well-defined question, that 
there's nothing so good as Google or Tweeting it out there or whatever.  And again, that's one 
of the good things about the technology.  But deep thought in the -- and I'm back to this again.  
Deep intelligence isn't about getting precise answers to well-defined questions.  It's being able 
to know, what are the big questions you should ask?   
 
20:05:55  
 
How do you fit this information together to form conceptual knowledge, to get big-picture 
knowledge?  And if you spend all your time Googling and grabbing information, you might think 
you're smart.  In fact, there was a very interesting study that came out just a couple of months 
ago that -- that showed that people tend to think they're smarter because they're Googling all 
the time, and they confuse what's on Google with what's in their own brains.  And as one of the 
researchers said, we have this weird -- we're in this weird time where we seem to be getting 
dumber, but we are thinking that we're smarter.  And that's kind of the illusion that this -- being 
wrapped in this information often provides.  But, you know, we have to make that distinction 
between getting quick answers from Wikipedia maybe, or from Google or whatever, and being 
smarter.  And I don't think they're the same thing. 
 
John Donvan: 
Genevieve or David. 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
So, listen, I mean, Nick, I think it's interesting, right.  You’ll concede to the notion that a well-
formed question is an appropriate way to engage with a piece of technology.   
 
20:07:00  
 
I'd sort of suggest that being able to form a well-formed question is an act of intelligence, right, 
being able to work out what the information is you want to extract and find the app that does it 
suggests a level of engagement with the world that's not about dumbness.  I mean, I think it's 
coming back to this for me, right, is how are you framing "dumb" and it's opposition and what 
that means, right.  If you're a new mom trying to work out, is this not sleeping thing a good 
thing or a bad thing, and when do a worry?  Those are questions that technology may be able 
to save you quicker than calling your own parent because she's in a different country.  Is that 
about making you more dumb?  I don't think so.  So there's something for me again about how 
we are framing the notion of dumbness and its opposition that I keep coming back to, right.

Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb 

David, hold up one second.  I want another response to come from the other side.  Nick. 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
Let's look at the question of how well we -- how well formed our questions are.  There's an 
interesting interview just recently with a top search engineer at Google.  And he was going 
through how much better the search engine has gotten in anticipating what we need and stuff.   
 
20:08:00  
 
And the interviewer said, "So I assume that as the -- as Google search engine has gotten 
smarter, people's questions have also gotten smarter.”  And he said -- he laughed and said, "No, 
it's exactly the opposite.  People get lazier and lazier.”  And this shows how we become 
dependent on the technology to do our thinking for us.  And as a result, we get lazy, we fall 
victim to what scientists call automation complacency.  You just simply think, let the machine 
do it for us.  So even the formation of questions, we seem to be getting worse and worse as the 
searching gets better and better. 
 
John Donvan: 
David Weinberger. 
 
David Weinberger: 
So -- 
 
[applause] 
 
David Weinberger: 
As I understand it, Nick, what's actually going on with the searches is that they've gotten much 
longer.  People actually type, "What is --" you know, the whole question with the question mark 
at the end, because that now works.  Whereas before, the well -- forming a question well with 
Google meant figuring out what were the terms that Google wanted that would give you back 
the right results.  It wasn't about good question forming, it was about being -- it was Google 
knowledge, you know, knowing how Google worked.   
 
20:09:04  
 
But I think that your comments about people Googling and they think that they're smart is that 
you're actually, I think, repeating Socrates' mistake which is, you know, really good company to 
be in.  But in the Phaedrus I'm sure you know this is in the Phaedrus Socrates makes a terrible 
mistake, doesn't make a lot -- a terrible mistake.  He's wondering about the smart tech of his 
time, which was writing things down.  It was literacy.  And he said, "This is terrible because our 
memory will fail.  We'll get much worse at remembering things.”  And he was absolutely right 
about that, because if anybody here would like to stand up and recite "The Illiad" by heart, 
please do so and show me wrong.  But generally, our memory has gotten much smaller than it -
- than it was.  So he was right about that, but he was wrong about the effect of literacy.  The

effect of literacy has in fact made our memory a thousand times better.  We know so -- we 
remember so much more as a species. 
 
20:09:58  
 
John Donvan: 
Andrew Keen. 
 
Andrew Keen: 
But that wasn’t Nick’s point.  I think just to speak -- no, but you're the one who brought up 
Socrates, right?  And so I can bring him up too. 
 
[laughter] 
 
David Weinberger: 
I was making a point, though, so -- 
 
Andrew Keen: 
Well, no, but you brought Socrates up, so I'm going to -- I'm going to –  
 
[laughter] 
 
I'm going to bring him up too.  So what was -- Socrates is great, his contribution.  Nick was just 
saying that while the problems with Google or our search-centric culture is people are 
increasingly lazy.  And what they're really lazy about is asking questions.  What we're having is 
the automation of the act of asking a question.  And that is one of the consequences or 
casualties of this digital revolution.  And, of course, Socrates' greatest -- one of his greatest 
contributions to our culture was in the art of asking the question.  That was the whole point of 
his philosophy, was it was about asking questions.   
 
20:10:55  
 
That's what knowledge was, asking questions.  And as Nick has made it clear, we have 
forgotten, or we are forgetting how to ask questions, and that's extremely troubling. 
 
John Donvan: 
David Weinberger. 
 
David Weinberger: 
So the other criticism -- the other criticism or fear that Socrates had in that dialogue about 
writing was that written stuff is never as good as in person, face to face, because the written 
thing will not respond to you.  You can't ask it a question.  And the internet is not a series of 
answers.  It's a series of conversations of various forms. And now we are able to engage in 
conversations about any topic, whether it's about epistemological chaos, or it's about whether

can get answers.  This is a far more interactive and responsive medium than we've had before, 
except in person conversation. 
 
John Donvan: 
I think we're going to have time for one more question.  I'm just curious myself, as this debate 
has proceeded before you, has anybody been multitasking in any form?  Yeah?  Some hands 
have gone up.

I just want to warn you, this has to really zoom in very quickly. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Wait.  The question is this:  The Cubans, for the last over 50 years have not had access to almost 
any technology, and they've been living in a way where they are -- the fiber optic cables are 
built around Cuba.  They're not -- they're not -- and when I was there, we were in a lot of bars 
and --

Okay, I --

But there wasn't wise -- there wasn't this wise thought [spelled phonetically].  And I'm 
wondering what -- are you disappointed with humans, or do you think that in the absence of 
technology people are just sitting around and like thinking about what's the meaning of life or -- 
you know, they want technology.  Like, they're talking about so --

John Donvan: 
Okay, that is a great question.  That's really good.  Actually was great.  I'll take it to Nick Carr. 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
There is -- I'm not -- I'm certainly not arguing against technology.   
 
20:13:01 
 
Technology is books, technology are the good things we can do with computers, the way 
computers can help us do things.  What I'm arguing about is how we think today, thanks to our 
dependency on our smartphones and our computers and our dependency on social media, and 
looking at the evidence.  And the evidence is -- and you can certainly understand why people 
who are cut out from the technology would want in, but that doesn't change the fact of how we 
actually use the technology and how we behave with it, and how it influences our thinking.  And 
the studies and the research and the science points to the fact that we are, in fact, turning into 
scatterbrains.  And, you know, it may well be that Cuba will get all of this technology, and they'll 
enjoy many benefits from it, but they'll probably have this same debate there in 10 years or 15 
years or whatever, because they'll realize that there's a lot that's lost as well as what's gained. 
 
20:14:05  
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, let me -- again, I like the question a lot.  Let me bring it to Genevieve Bell.

Genevieve Bell: 
Well, there's something kind of extraordinary in the notion that it's good for people to want in 
but only if they want in on your terms. I mean, it's sort of something you have to think about 
what --

I don’t think I said that.

They could want the technology, but they shouldn't want it compulsively.  I mean, I think 
there's sort of something interesting lurking underneath with that. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, he didn't say that, either.

Really? 
 
John Donvan: 
He said that, "Of course they want the -- of course they want it," but maybe the same thing's 
going to happen there that he feels has happened here. 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
Which is about -- what was the phrase you used -- if I'm going to attempt to get it right now -- 
it's "compulsive," right, that the compulsiveness of the technology --

Genevieve Bell:

Male Speaker: 
-- gathering of information. 
 
20:14:51  
 
Genevieve Bell: 
-- of our relationship to a particular set of technology is preventing kind of these deeper 
thoughts.  I guess the question is -- and I would had to use Cuba as a kind of, you know, 
example, as a kind of laboratory experiment -- but if you were, what is the -- kind of the vision 
you then have about what the right use of it is?  What's the right use of technology if the one 
we have now isn't it? 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
We can use technology in all sorts of ways, and there's nothing wrong with going on Facebook 
to see what your friends are up to, to arrange doing things.  My vision, my point would be that 
actually what we've done is created this technological environment, both because of the 
interests of companies like Google and Facebook and Intel, to get us to be constantly 
interacting with our computer screens, constantly distracted and interrupted, and also because

we have inside our brains this primitive desire, well-documented, to want to know everything 
that's going on around us, probably because it helped save your life, you know, eons ago.   
 
20:15:53  
 
But we combine this commercial desire to keep people distracted with our own kind of 
proclivity to want to be distracted.  And what that does is it makes it harder and harder for us 
to do something that's always been hard, which is to concentrate and be attentive and think 
deeply. 
 
John Donvan: 
David, do you want to respond? 
 
[applause] 
 
David Weinberger: 
So you say, Nick, that -- I still don't know the answer to the question, though.  I mean, you're 
not against technology, it's just what happens when you use technology.  We seem to get -- 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
Well, that's what we're debating. 
 
David Weinberger: 
-- no, I -- I'm seriously curious, Nick, what you would recommend to Cuba as a policy, trying to 
avoid these terrible effects and only get the good uses that you have specified -- what you 
would recommend to Cuba as a company -- as a -- excuse me, as a country for a policy or to any 
user in the room, what it is that we should be doing in order to get the benefits of this 
computer based tech but not fall victim to the danger of being unable to think thoughts again. 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
Well, I'd be worried about putting it into the hands of Cuba's government or any government 
determining how we use technology or how we use information.   
 
20:17:03  
 
So I would -- okay, push that to the side.  I would say that what we -- everything we know about 
it is that we should use it less --

That concludes --

John Donvan: 
-- that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S.  Debate, where our motion is, 
"Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb.”  Thank you for that Cuba question.  That was -- thank 
you for persisting because it really got to an interesting place. 
 
[laughter] 
 
So now we move on to round three.  Round three are closing statements by each debater in 
turn.  They will be two minutes each.  Remember how you voted before the arguments began 
because as soon as this is concluded we're going to have you vote again, and then we'll have 
the results of your choice of -- your decision on which side was most persuasive.  So round 
three, closing statements, first here summarizing his position in support of the motion, "Smart 
Technology is Making Us Dumb," here is Andrew Keen, author of, "The Internet is Not the 
Answer." 
 
20:18:00  
 
Andrew Keen: 
Well, you can't have a debate like this without again ending with Socrates and Plato, since 
we're supposed to be talking about dumbness and intelligence.  You remember, or most of you 
should remember, in Plato's "Republic," Socrates' definition of intelligence was bound up in his 
notion of the cave and of being able to distinguish illusion from truth.  And his argument in the 
"Republic" was that we were mostly looking at shadows in his cave.  And going from Socrates 
and Plato back to David, let me quote him.   
 
[laughter] 
 
He said, "The Internet is giving us the idea of freedom.”  Let me repeat that.  The Internet is 
giving us the idea of freedom.  And I agree with him.  It is giving us the idea of freedom.  And he 
says that's empowering.   
 
20:18:56  
 
But look at our world.  We're not empowered.  It is, of course, the classic manifestation, 
perhaps in digital terms, of Plato or Socrates's cave, where we think we're empowered.  We 
think, by making statements about politics, or economics, or supposedly bringing down some 
powerful figure, we think we're free.  We think we're empowered.  But this is the ultimate -- to 
borrow another philosophical term -- this is the ultimate manifestation of false consciousness.  
We're living in a world where we think we're empowered.  We're living in the world where the 
idea of freedom has essentially been digitalized, and commodified, and sold to us -- or perhaps 
not sold because it's a supposedly free economy.  But the truth is, in this world, we are more 
and more -- I don’t know about the word dumb.

The motion, Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb.  And here to summarize his position against 
this motion, David Weinberger, senior researcher at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and 
Society. 
 
David Weinberger: 
Well, thank you.  This has been really -- has been great.  But I listened to your arguments, and I 
come back to the fact that, even if you're right about everything you said, I think it's undeniable 
that this is the greatest time in human history to be wanting to know.  There is no better time.  
The access to information has never been this free.  Everybody -- you don't have to be at a 
major university to get access to a wide range.  The ability to engage -- not just read, and not to 
-- not even just to explore, to follow your interests where they go, by following links, and 
finding people who know things that you don't, and being guided to sources that you care 
about, that you didn't know existed, the discovery of knowledge and information in the world.   
 
20:21:09  
 
We've never had an opportunity like this.  We have never had it.  And the ability to participate 
in the creation of knowledge, whether this is by asking questions -- dumb questions, smart 
questions -- by posing wrong ideas and bad ideas and finding how the world reacts, by 
participating in a more genuine way and learning from people, by lurking on lists and seeing 
what people are saying -- where lurking means watching but not talking; it's not the bad lurking.  
We've never had to take a --  
 
[laughter] 
 
-- course at a major university for free, to read open access journals, where most of the best 
physics in the world, the best math in the world is being done.  To think that this is not the

greatest age to be -- to want to know things strikes me as crazy, as crazy.  No matter what facts 
you point at, and brain chemistry, et cetera -- all I -- well, none of which I deny.   
 
20:22:03  
 
Nevertheless, if the question is, is smart technology making us dumb, I think, just looking at 
what is there should tell us no.  This is the smartest age we've ever had. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, David Weinberger.   
 
[applause] 
 
And the motion is Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb.  And here to summarize his position in 
support of the motion, Nick Carr.  Author of "The Glass Cage: Automation and Us." 
 
Nicholas Carr: 
Unfortunately, David, the science happens to be against you here.  But we've been speaking 
mainly about communications and information.  And I think that's a very important part of -- 
about smart technology, but it's not everything.  What we're seeing now is we're relying on 
software, relying on algorithms to do more and more things.  Not just to gather information, 
but if you're a pilot, you use them to fly.   
 
20:22:55  
 
If you're a doctor, you use them for diagnosis.  If you're just an average person, you turn on 
Google Maps to get around.  And we want to believe that this -- by handing over tasks to our 
computers, we'll be raised up.  We'll -- our own talents will get sharper and better.  But even 
here, the research points to something very different happening.  There was a fascinating study 
done in the Netherlands, a series of experiments, where people were given increasingly smart 
software to do difficult tasks.  And what the researchers found is that as the software got 
smarter, the people got dumber.  They got lazier.  They began to become reliant on the 
software itself.  They weren't practicing their own talents.  And we can see this as well in all of 
those examples I talked about.  David mentioned, well, aren't pilots -- shouldn't pilots have the 
smartest technology possible?  Actually, if you look at airline safety research, and if you look at 
the recent proclamations from the FAA, they're saying that over automation is actually making 
pilots less capable.   
 
20:24:04 
 
And we have to remove some of the dependency on computers.  You see this as well with 
accountants who become overly dependent on their software and lose the sharpness of their 
thinking.  You see it with doctors who become dependent on the templates that they go 
through when you're in the examination room.  I talked about how the Google person saw this

with search as well.  Another Google top engineer put the -- put the problem very bluntly in an 
article.  He wrote, "Sharp tools, dull minds." 
 
John Donvan: 
Nick Carr, I'm sorry, your time is up.  Thank you very much.

Our motion is "Smart technology is making us dumb.”  And here to summarize her position 
against this motion, Genevieve Bell, vice president of the corporate strategy at Intel. 
 
Genevieve Bell: 
So the proposition, "Smart technology is making us dumb," it's clearly one that seduces many of 
you in this room.   
 
20:24:56 
 
I watch you applaud, I watch you nod, and I know that there's an echo in it.  There's something 
in it that always appeals.  We say the same thing about many technologies over the last 200 
years.  And I want to make us think for just a moment here about what is that seduction?  What 
is the anxiety that is appealed to when you applaud the notion that this technology is making us 
dumb?  Because at beginning of this debate, most of you raised your hands that you had smart 
technology in your lives.  Those of you who don't own it know people who do and live in worlds 
that are augmented by it.  When you ask if anyone in the room was willing to admit to feeling 
dumber about it, there were only two of you who actually raised your hand.  That makes me 
suspect that the number of you in the room who feel it, it's why you applaud, but you wouldn't 
say you did feel dumber because of it.  My suspicion is that threading through all of that is a 
very human set of preoccupations and anxieties, an anxiety about what technology means for 
us, what it means for our humanity, our bodies, our competency, what it means to have new 
technologies in some ways threaten some of those things.   
 
20:26:03 
 
But the reality is also, despite Nick's, in some ways, admiral notion that we should just use it 
less, that there is more and more technology in our lives, technology that we rely on, 
technology that some of us love, technology that many of us find valuable and useful and 
instructive, that helps shape our exercise, our financial futures, that we use for banking and 
travel and leisure activities.  And there's something in all of this about why it is that despite all 
of that, we like to imagine we are more dumb.  I find it hard to imagine, sitting in a room full of 
New Yorkers that you secretly in your heart of hearts believe you are dumb.

Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb 

I may be foreign to this country, but I'm not foreign to the idea of what New York stands for.  
Likewise to a radio listening audience who will feel the same thing.  So it strikes me that it's very 
hard to imagine that smart technology is really making all of us dumb. 
 
20:26:57  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Genevieve Bell. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that concludes our closing statements.  And now it's time to learn which side you feel has 
argued the best here.  We're going to ask you to go again to the key pads at your seats and vote 
a second time after hearing the arguments.  Again, the motion is this:  Smart technology is 
making us dumb.  Press number one if you agree with this motion now.  Press number two if 
you disagree with this motion now, or press number three if you became or remain undecided.  
And we'll have the results in about two minutes.  Okay.  I want to get your attention back, 
please.  May I have your attention?   
 
20:28:00 
 
May I have your attention, please?  Hello!  Hello.  Thank you.  Thanks I wanted your attention 
while the -- while the results are being tabulated because I really wanted to say a couple of 
things about -- first of all about the audience questions tonight which were terrific.  And it's not 
always true.  They're all -- they all really moved this debate to great places, so thank you, 
everybody, who asked a question. 
 
[applause] 
 
And I also want to commend the debaters.  They obviously feel very passionately about this.  
But there was a good deal of intellectual honesty and respect on both sides.  And they just 
made it darn interesting for all of us.  So thank you for what you brought. 
 
[applause] 
 
I also want to thank the generous donors who make these debates possible.  The ticket prices 
do not come anywhere close to covering the cost of putting on these debates.   
 
20:28:59 
 
We are a nonprofit, and so we would really encourage you to visit our website, iq2us.org to 
make a donation to keep this going and help us to grow to even more debates in the future.  
And speaking of more debates in the future, our next one is going to be here at the Kaufman 
Center on May 26th.  The motion is "Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America.”  Among our

debaters, we're going to have a former special assistant to the president and White House 
coordinater for the Middle East, who just stepped down from the administration.  Next month, 
we're going to be in Philadelphia again at the National Constitution Center where we have been 
staging a series of debates that take an absolutely constitutional approach -- issues to a very 
constitutional framework.  And in this case, we're looking at the issue of whether same-sex 
couples have the right to marry.  So on June 2nd, the motion will be "The equal protection 
clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.”   
 
20:29:54 
 
For the full list of our debates and to purchase tickets you can go to -- again, to our website.  
And finally, I mentioned this before, but I just want to mention it again, that this evening will 
live on infinitely and digitally through that -- that place they've all been talking about here 
tonight.  And it -- and you can download all of our debates, including this one, through the 
Apple and Android mobile stores where we have a really lovely -- a lovely app.  All of our 
debates, in both video and audio, are available there.  And you can learn about upcoming 
debates and buy tickets.  And it's a smart app, I need to point out. 
 
[laughter] 
 
And you can watch the live stream on iq2us.org, et cetera.  So, I have the final results now.  It's 
all in.  Let's remind you that the motion was "Smart tech --" that the motion is, "Smart 
technology is making us dumb.”  And again, it's the difference between the two votes, before 
and after, that determine our winner.   
 
20:30:52 
 
Let's look at the first vote.  Smart technology is making us dumb.  37 percent agreed, 33 percent 
were against, and 30 percent were undecided.  Kind of a three-way split.  Let's take a look at 
the second vote.  Again, we're looking for the difference.  The second vote, the team arguing 
for the motion, their second vote was 47 percent, from 37 to 47 percent.  They picked up 10 
percentage points.  That is the number to beat.  Let's see the team against the motion.  Their 
first vote was 33 percent.  Their second was 43 percent.  They also pulled in 10 percent. 
 
[applause] 
 
It is an Intelligence Squared first.  It is a tie.  Congratulations to both teams, all four of our 
debaters.  Thank you from me, John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S.  We'll see you next 
time.
