JOHN DONVAN 

We are starting and I would like to welcome our debaters onto 

the stage.  Thank you for that warm welcome to our debaters and 

I’d like to also ask for a warm welcome for the chairman and 

founder of Intelligence Squared US, Robert Rosenkranz.   

[APPLAUSE]  

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Well, thank you all very much for joining us tonight, you know, 

the mission of Intelligence Squared, is to encourage our audience 

to consider both sides of contentious issues.  To think twice 

about their positions.  So one of our panelists tonight, former 

Governor Eliot Spitzer, has certainly done that.   Just last week 

he thought twice about arguing in favor of tonight’s motion, and

decided to argue against it.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  When 

Obama took office, the financial sector had just been saved from 

collapse by massive government intervention.   That collapse 

occurred against the backdrop of a relatively benign real 

economy, with decent growth and high employment.  Then in the 

fourth quarter of ’08 and the first quarter of ’09, the real economy 

went into free fall.  Economic output shrank, and unemployment 

rose at rates that we haven’t seen since the Great Depression.  

The collapse of the real economy could’ve been a death blow for 

an already weak financial sector.  We were truly on the edge of an 

economic abyss, and fear itself was becoming a real self-fulfilling 

prophecy.   Well the Obama administration threw every policy 

weapon it could at the problem.  Zero interest rates, increased 

money supply, backstops for key financial institutions in the 

entire automotive industry, and a massive fiscal stimulus 

package.   And confidence has clearly been restored.  Businesses 

are building inventories, consumers are spending, investors are 

no longer hoarding cash.  The stock market is up 19 percent 

since the beginning of the year, and corporate bonds are up 

nearly as much.  Last quarter, we had 3.5 percent growth in the 

economy.  It seems that the recession is over, and that 

Armageddon has been avoided.   Is this not a picture of unalloyed 

success?  Well, not so fast.  Unemployment has increased to 10.5 

percent.  We bailed out the banks so that they could provide

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 3. 

 

 

 

credit to businesses and consumers, and instead they’re 

shrinking the loan portfolios.  Government deficits are running in 

the trillions.  Public debt has exploded, and the dollar is 

collapsing.  We may eventually face a stark choice, between 

default, and inflation.  And the private sector, the engine that has 

powered America’s economic dynamism, is facing the burden of 

higher tax rates, higher health care costs, carbon taxes, pro-

union initiatives, pay czars and other intrusive regulation.   With 

such powerful anti-growth forces in play, can we expect new jobs 

to put unemployed Americans back to work?  Well, I’m not going 

to be the one to answer that question, but I will make a 

prediction.  That tonight’s debate will be lively and informative, 

and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over to John Donvan, 

and the outstanding panelists we have with us this evening.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Robert.  [APPLAUSE]  Andmay I just invite one more 

round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz.  [APPLAUSE]  Well, 

welcome, everybody, to another debate from Intelligence Squared 

US, I’m John Donvan of ABC News and once again it is my 

pleasure to serve as host and moderator, as the six debaters you 

see sharing the stage here with me at the Skirball Center for the 

Performing Arts at New York University, three against three, will 

be debating this motion, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are 

Working Effectively.”   Now, I want to point out this is a debate, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 4. 

 

 

 

it’s a contest and although we have some professors on the 

panels they are not here to lecture, they are here to attack and 

defend but with ideas well-articulated and well-argued, and in 

this debate, you our live audience here at the Skirball Center, act 

as the judges.   By the time the evening has ended, you will have 

voted twice, once before the debate begins and once again at the 

end, to tell us whether you agree or disagree with the motion.  

And at the end of the debate the team that has changed the most 

minds, will be declared our winner.   Now, it is time to vote our 

preliminary vote, and if you go to the keypad on your left 

side…there’s a range of buttons from 1 to 10.  Ignore all of them 

but 1, 2 and 3.  If you push number 1 it means that you agree 

with the motion that “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working 

Effectively.”   Number 2 means that you disagree, and number 3 

means that you’re undecided.  And if you feel that you’ve pushed 

the buttons incorrectly, just repeat the correct entry and it will 

update to the current one.  So it looks like everybody’s done that.  

And so our preliminary vote is in and let’s let the debate begin, 

Round 1, opening statements by each debater, seven minutes 

each.   We begin with Mark Zandi who is an economist and the 

founder of Moody’s Economy.com.  During the 2008 Presidential 

campaign he was an advisor to Senator John McCain, he has 

since become an advisor to the Obama White House, Mark, I’m 

not sure what that tells us about which side you’re on…

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 5. 

 

 

 

[LAUGHTER]  but the floor is yours—   

MARK ZANDI 

I’m an ecumenical economist, let’s put it that way.  I want to 

thank Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to be here today, 

it’s certainly an honor to be here and to address such an 

important topic.  I’m going to make three points in my opening 

remarks.  Point number one.  I think it’s really quite amazing the 

totality of the policy response from the administration, I think, we 

forget all the things that have been done to try to shore up the 

economy and we tend to focus on the one or two or three things 

that we’re most annoyed about, and we focus on that.  Let me 

just spend a few minutes, well, I’ve got six minutes and 30 

seconds, let me spend a couple minutes going over that.  And 

there are three broad areas of policy effort here, first is the effort 

to shore up to the financial system, and this is everything from 

what the FDIC has done, increasing deposit insurance limits, to 

guaranteeing bank debt to allow the banks to issue [UNCLEAR], 

to efforts by the Treasury to help facilitate all the things that the 

Federal Reserve Board has been doing to try to provide credit to 

the financial system and stabilize the financial system.   Perhaps 

the most important thing in my mind with regard to the effort to 

shore up the financial system, was the banks’ stress tests--do 

you remember the stress test, this was done back earlier this 

year.  And to me, those stress tests were the modern-day 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 6. 

 

 

 

equivalent of what FDR did back in the Great Depression, he—

I’m going to exaggerate just a little bit but only a little bit.  He 

closed all the banks on a Friday and he said on the subsequent 

Monday to his Treasury Secretary, open all of them except a 

couple hundred of them and the Treasury Secretary said to him, 

well, which ones should I open, and FDR said, well, it really 

doesn’t matter because the ones you open, everything will think 

are safe, and life will go on and—  [LAUGHTER]   In fact it 

worked, it restored confidence and that was the beginning of the 

end of the Great Depression and the stress test in fact did that, it 

restored confidence and the financial system is stable.  The 

second blotter of the policy response was to shore up the two 

weakest parts of our economy, the housing market and the auto 

market.   I’m not going to spend much time on the auto market 

because Steve is so intimately involved in that great effort, and 

he’ll talk about that, but I know housing, and the efforts to shore 

up the housing market have been quite amazing, and just to 

name a few things.   The first-time homebuyer tax credit, very 

important in stabilizing housing values this summer, to help to 

support buying by first-time home buyers, the loan modification 

plan to help homeowners who are facing foreclosure, to get their 

monthly mortgage payments down so that they can afford their, 

their mortgage payment.  Efforts to provide more credit to the 

residential mortgage market through Fannie Mae and Freddie 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 7. 

 

 

 

Mac and FHA.   Here’s a statistic for you.  90 percent of all the 

residential mortgage loans being made today are being made by 

the federal government,  so if the federal government wasn’t 

making those loans, the housing market would be in complete 

disarray and we’d be in very significant trouble, so the second 

broad policy effort was to help shore up those two key sectors, 

the two weakest sectors of our economy.  And the third policy 

response, broadly speaking, is the fiscal stimulus, much 

maligned, but ultimately at the end of the day, very successful.  I 

don’t think it’s any accident that the recession came to an end, at 

the same time that the stimulus was providing its maximum 

economic benefit to the economy.   And the stimulus is lots of 

things, it’s aid to unemployed workers, it’s helped the state 

governments, it’s the first-time homebuyer tax credit, it’s Cash 

for Clunkers, a long list of things, the infrastructure spending, all 

very important.  So, please remember, point number one, that 

the policy effort is a range of many things, it’s been incredibly—

it’s amassing and incredibly unprecedented what has been done 

here, and key to bringing an end to this Great Recession.  Point 

number two, here are the statistics I think are overwhelming.   A 

year ago, think about a year ago, what was going on, major 

financial institutions were evaporating or being nationalized, 

Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman, Bear, AIG, Citigroup was on 

the doorstep of falling apart, and look at the situation today.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 8. 

 

 

 

The financial system is not normal, no, but it is stable.  And 

banks aren’t lending to us yet as business people and as 

consumers but they’re moving in that direction, and just imagine 

where we’d be today without that stability in the financial system.   

Think about the economic statistics, housing activity, new and 

existing single-family housing starts hit a low in January, 

housing construction hit a low in January, back at the beginning 

of the year, housing values were falling very rapidly, today, the 

last couple of quarters they’ve actually begun to increase.   GDP, 

the value of all the things that we produce as an economy, grew 

3.5 percent in the third quarter and the growth was very broad-

based, that was the first substantive growth in over a year and a 

half.   And clearly driving the economy forward, the GDP in the 

fourth quarter, the current quarter, is on track to be positive 

again.  The job market.  Last thing to improve, but it is 

improving, we’re moving in the right direction.  We—just to give 

you a statistic, at the beginning of the year, we were losing 

700,000 jobs on average every single month.   In the last three 

months we lost 200,000 jobs a month, now I know, that’s a lot of 

jobs, unemployment is still rising.  But the trend lines are right, 

they’re moving in the right direction and my view is by early next 

year, we will have a stable job market, and by the end of next 

year, we will have job growth that’s meaningful enough to bring 

down the rate of unemployment, so everything is moving in the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 9. 

 

 

 

right direction.  Finally, point number three, I said there were 

three points…  The proposition is, “Obama’s Economic Policies 

Are Working Effectively.”  It’s not, they have worked.  This is not 

a mission accomplished, no one is arguing that this is over and 

done with, we have more work to do, and the administration is 

still working.  Just last week, they passed another piece of 

legislation to help extend unemployment insurance benefits for 

people who lose their jobs in 2009, now if you become 

unemployed in 2009 you have 99 weeks of unemployment 

insurance benefits, they extended, and they expanded the first-

time homebuyer tax credit into next year to provide support to 

the housing market, and they’ve provided a number of other 

supports.  They are debating right now and will likely pass other 

efforts to shore up the economy, extend some of the other 

provisions in the stimulus to make sure that the stimulus 

provides benefit to the economy as we make our way into 2010.  

And more importantly and perhaps most importantly, we are 

working through some of the structural problems in our 

economy,  working on the hard, difficult issues, the most obvious 

would be financial regulatory reform.  Now this is something you 

don’t want to do quickly, you don’t want to make a mistake.  Our 

financial regulatory structure has been in place since the Great 

Depression.   It feels like it, and we have got to take time to make 

it right.  So, in my view, what the administration has done has

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 10. 

 

 

 

been highly successful.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Mark Zandi.  [APPLAUSE]  And I just want to point 

out the amazing virtuosity of Mark Zandi who was watching 

the clock the whole time, and he said “Thank you” as the clock 

that’s in front of us you can’t see, turned to zero.  [LAUGHTER]  

It’s just about perfect.  [LAUGHTER]   

Our motion is “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working 

Effectively” and our first debater to argue against the motion, 

James Galbraith of the University of Texas, he generally argues 

from the left, he also has a rather scathing view of economists in 

the United States in general, he has said that, on all important 

policy issues, they are on the wrong side, himself an economist, 

James Galbraith.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JAMES GALBRAITH 

Thank you very much.  The question before the house may 

appear political.  But it in fact is not.  One person on our panel 

as you’ve heard, shifted his position to argue our side.  Two of us, 

supported President Obama in the last election and all three of 

us hope that he will succeed.  The question is about the 

economy, it is about whether the economic program is working 

effectively.  Lawrence Summers, the Chief Economic Advisor to 

the President, told the Washington Post on November 8th, quote, “I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 11. 

 

 

 

think we got the Recovery Act right.  The primary objective of our 

policy is having more work done, more product produced, and 

more people earning more income.”  We agree with that standard.  

The economy is not performing up to that standard.   Basically, if 

you leave aside the actions some of which Mark mentioned such 

as the extension of deposit insurance by the FDIC, that were 

taken under the Bush administration, the Obama economic 

program…the principal points are two.   One is the Recovery Act, 

the stimulus bill, and the other is the policy of providing free 

reserves, credit at zero interest rate, to the banking system in the 

hopes that credit will flow again.  So the question before us is, 

was the stimulus sufficient, and secondly, is credit flowing again.   

Now the stimulus did some good things, it helped forestall the 

complete collapse of budgets in the state and local government 

sector, it created some construction jobs and will create more.  It 

has provided some tax relief.   The question is, is it enough.  I 

think it is pretty clear, that it was not enough.  The stimulus was 

enacted based on a forecast that unemployment would not rise 

past about 8 percent by the middle of this year, would decline 

thereafter, that forecast was clearly wildly optimistic.   It 

underestimated the state and local crisis where job cuts, or, just 

offsetting, the jobs created with federal funds.  It did too little too 

late to meet the foreclosure crisis which is presently running at 

several million homes a year.   Let me quote a distinguished 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 12. 

 

 

 

economist.  On November 6th, 2009, he wrote, “After rising for 

more than two and a half years the country’s unemployment rate 

crossed into double-digit territory in October, with a jobless rate 

of 10.2 percent.  This provides another sign of the severity of the 

current downturn, the very long road we face back to full 

employment, and the urgent need for more policy action to create 

jobs and protect those who can’t find work.  With such a huge 

fire, we need every hose we can find to put it out.”   I agree with 

that.  There is an urgent need for more policy action.  Who said 

it?  Why, Larry Mishel, President of the Economic Policy Institute 

said it just 10 days ago.  [LAUGHTER]  What you said… if you 

say this, that you also agree with Larry Summers, that the 

Recovery Act got it right.   Now I am not an economic forecaster.  

But there are forecasters I greatly respect, and here is what one 

of them testified to Congress, on October 29th.  “It is growing 

clear,” he said, “that more policy help will be needed to ensure 

that the tentative recovery evolves into a self-sustaining 

expansion.   Although a double-dip downturn is less than likely, 

meaningful threats to the recovery still exist.  Most notable, are 

the intensifying stresses in the job market, the ongoing 

foreclosure crisis, the boom and bust in the commercial real 

estate market the dysfunctional structured finance market and 

the fiscal woes of state and local governments.”  Quite an 

impressive list and I hesitate to say this in a theater but it 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 13. 

 

 

 

sounds like other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the 

play.  [LAUGHTER]   To go on, “Congress must provide more 

resources to unemployed workers, whose benefits are running 

out, to state and local governments unable to balance their 

budgets and to household and businesses looking to buy homes 

and invest.”   I agree with that.  Congress must provide more 

resources.  Who said it.  Why, Mark Zandi said it, founder of 

Moody’s Economy.com, just two weeks ago.  Would you say this, 

if you agreed with Larry Summers, that the Recovery Act got it 

right.  Now it’s true, free money has saved the banks, everyone 

knows this, from their profit reports and their bonuses.  The 

stock market has come back and so has the price of oil.  Is this 

enough?  We think not.  We think the housing crisis is important, 

we think the collapse of small business is important, we think 10 

percent unemployment as far as the eye can see is a disaster.  We 

know as every business in America knows that credit is not 

flowing again.   What would a working program look like.  First it 

would dissolve rather than coddle the toxic banks.  It would stop 

the displacement of people from their homes, not just slow it, not 

just help a few, but stop the displacement of people from their 

homes.   It would help all their workers who are ready to leave 

their jobs, to retire by providing them with a more comfortable 

employment, and health care that they can count on at an earlier 

age than 65, opening up places for younger people who are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 14. 

 

 

 

looking for jobs in today’s catastrophic labor market.   And it 

would fund a lot of new green jobs, all across the country, 

providing every American who wants a chance to work, for the 

duration, until the private sector comes back, revives and is able 

to take up the slack.   On our side, we don’t agree, on all of the 

issues.  But on the issues just outlined and I submit they are the 

essential issues, the facts are plain.  Better than nothing is not 

good enough.  There was a poll…released just a few days ago on 

November 6th, which stated that 47 percent of Americans think 

that the economy is still the most important issue, that’s against 

all the other issues that might be considered.   The American 

people know what this is about.  They do not think that the 

program is working effectively, and that is surely telling.  If it 

were working effectively, they would know.  Thank you very 

much.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Well….we just had another one of those one-second 

accomplishments.  Next to argue for the motion, we asked the 

White House if they would provide a member of the 

administration to take part in the debate, they did not want to do 

that, but they suggested our next debater, Larry Mishel who is 

the president of the Economic Policy Institute, so Larry—I’m not 

saying you’re the White House’s guy.  But, now everybody’s going 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 15. 

 

 

 

to think of you that way as [LAUGHS], as you get up, but the floor 

is yours.    

LAWRENCE MISHEL 

Well, I hope I get invited to the next official state dinner then—  

[LAUGHTER]  You know, as an economist, over my career I’ve 

been focused on what are the living standards of the American 

people, the working class.  How they’ve done, and so what has 

mattered to me most on economic policy, is in fact, what have we 

done to create jobs, to get the unemployment rate down.   And so 

I’m going to focus on the Recovery Act.  And I’m here to say that I 

think it has actually been a bold and effective act.  No, it has not 

solved all our economic problems.  It has not solved the 

unemployment problem.  That is not quite the standard that you 

should imagine, for judging whether the policies are effective.   

Let me just say—my imagery for all this.  President Obama 

inherited a really large apartment building, it was all aflame, 

afire.  He gathered all the fire trucks and hoses he could, and he 

put out the flames, in at least half the floors.   But the critics say, 

look, there’s still fire and so your policies must be wrong.  And 

especially, it turns out, these critics are the conservatives who 

actually lit the darn fire.  [LAUGHTER]  And they tried to keep the 

fire hoses from actually getting to the fire building.  [LAUGHTER]   

I think it’s actually quite outrageous.  Now it’s a somewhat 

different—  [APPLAUSE]  I think it’s somewhat different to my 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 16. 

 

 

 

longtime, I don’t have any old friends, only have longtime friends, 

Jamie Galbraith.  But we’ll get around to that.  So let me talk at 

first about what the fire was.  Mark talked about it.  Over the 

nine months that included the last half of 2008 and the first 

three months of 2009, none of which were the responsibility of 

President Obama, okay, we had the fastest decline in the 

economy, basically since they started collecting the data in 1947 

on a quarterly basis.   We had already seen six million jobs lost 

by March 2009.  The unemployment rate was already 8.5 

percent, which is the highest it was since the great, really deep 

recession of the early 1980s.  So we were in deep…you know 

what.  [LAUGHTER]   And so we had the Recovery Act which was 

passed very quickly and effectively, actually started having some 

effect in March, but mostly started having an effect in April.  And 

I want to go through exactly what it does, so it’s not an 

abstraction.  What are the different components.   First as Mark 

mentioned, support to the unemployed, and helping them not 

only with unemployment benefits and higher benefits, extended 

benefits, and health care, and a major increase in food stamps.   

Why does that matter.  By supporting their incomes and their 

spending it creates jobs, throughout the economy.  Secondly.  

There was a major influx of money to state governments, who, by 

resolving their own deficits when they have to cut programs and 

raise taxes, they actually--what Paul Krugman said is they are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 17. 

 

 

 

like 50 little Herbert Hoovers.   They are driving us into recession, 

by actually exacerbating the problem.  Okay.  When you give 

them the money, they don’t cut the programs, they keep the 

people that work for them in the local government’s employ.   To 

keep the contractors and the private sector delivering 

construction contracts, health care, nursing homes, et cetera, 

employed, and by all those people being employed through 

spending money they keep jobs going throughout the economy.   

Okay, there’s also a third, a tax cut that was in effect in April, 

everybody’s withholding on their W-2’s, was actually increased, 

providing more income, more money to spend.  Last there was 

some government spending in infrastructure that started going 

out.   But the main infrastructure spending, actually is scheduled 

for 2010.  That’s when we get the energy alternatives, that’s when 

we get more infrastructure, and other things that are going to 

create productivity in the long run as well as create jobs.  What 

has been the effect of all this spending?  Well as Mark said, over 

the last six months, we’ve actually seen a much different 

outcome than what was projected in the springtime, the economy 

shrank by a little bit, it would’ve shrunk by around 4 percent, 

but it actually shrank by a little bit less than 1 percent.   In the 

summer the economy actually grew.  Now, as someone dedicated 

to raising the living standards of the entire broad middle class, 

who’s satisfied with that, I’m not satisfied with that, okay?   But 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 18. 

 

 

 

the question is, are you going to judge the Obama administration 

policy ineffective, because it hasn’t corrected what I think is 30 

years of generating inequality, false-hearted, silly deregulation 

and worshipping of markets where we shouldn’t have done it that 

got us into this darn mess?   I don’t think that’s quite 

appropriate.  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you—don’t take my time.  Um—  

[LAUGHTER]  We calculate that the Recovery Act has actually 

created anywhere between 1.1 to 1.5 million jobs by the end of 

September.  I’m not satisfied that the job losses are 200,000 

rather than 700,000, but I think it’s quite great.   I’m very 

worried about the fact that unemployment is going to be high for 

many years to come, too high.  I don’t blame that on President 

Obama, I blame that on the bums that put us in this mess.  And 

you should too.  [APPLAUSE]   Now, it’s true that the 

unemployment rate is higher than what the administration said it 

was going to be.  They said if we did the Recovery Act it was going 

to only get to 8 percent.  Well, let me mention something.   The 

unemployment rate in March, before the Recovery Act even had 

an effect was already 8.5 percent.  Now I did tell my friends in the 

White House, that’s a silly thing, don’t project like that.  You 

shouldn’t do that, you’re going to get caught by that, and in fact, 

they have been hung by their own petard so to speak.   But the 

fact is that, let me tell you that this is not a policy failure.  This is 

a failure of my profession, economists.  If you look at what 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 19. 

 

 

 

economists projected right at the time of the election, the blue-

chip forecasts, and look at that same period I told you about, the 

nine months that includes the last half of last year and the first 

three months of this year.  Now they’re already halfway through 

that period.  And they were saying that the economy was going to 

shrink at a 1.5 percent rate, over that nine-month period.  And it 

actually shrank by three times that much.  So the fact is, what 

the administration got wrong in its forecast was it didn’t have a 

right sense of what things were going to be without the policy.   I 

think they got the policy right, the policy’s had a substantial 

impact.  Now has it solved all our problems, the fact is I’m not so 

sure how much more could’ve been done, economically.  I can 

darn well tell you that politically, there was not much more on 

the table that they could get.   What was put through the House 

and was put through the Senate, what was stopped, is some 

people that were in the Senate, who are known as moderates 

which just means they want to do a little bit less of what 

everybody else—

JOHN DONVAN  

So here is where we are, we are halfway through the opening 

round of this Intelligence Squared US debate, I’m John Donvan of 

ABC News.  We have six debaters, two teams out there, fighting it 

out over this motion, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working 

Effectively.”   And now on to our fourth debater.  Allan Meltzer 

who is an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, he is not the 

liberal member of his team, he is far from it.  And if you caught 

CNBC a few days ago Allan Meltzer appeared there and I quote, 

“We have an administration that spends and spends and lies.”  

Ladies and gentlemen, Allan Meltzer.   

[APPLAUSE]   

ALLAN MELTZER 

I’m here to talk about the Obama policy, not about apartment 

house fires.  [LAUGHTER, PAUSE]  The policy has had a mixed 

result.  There’re some small positive effects.  But, there are five 

reasons for concluding the policies are not working effectively.  

First, the forecast was that $780 billion would be spent, the 

maximum unemployment rate would be 8 percent.  Second, it’s 

now 10.2 percent, continuing to rise, that’s a failure.   The 

second, is the administration recognition that the policy has 

failed.  If the policy had succeeded, they would not be talking 

about another stimulus program, it recognizes, that talk 

recognizes, that the stimulus was not effective.  That their 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 21. 

 

 

 

policies have, so far, been very weak.   Third, the administration 

invented something called “jobs saved.”  You can search 

economic textbooks from now to the end of time, [APPLAUSE]  

you will not find something called “jobs saved.”  Jobs saved, how 

do you know if you job is saved.  Sure, it was true that, if we paid 

the states to have a smaller deficit, they didn’t fire quite so many 

teachers.   But, we also shifted the deficit, to the federal 

government, with higher future tax rates that are going to have to 

pay for those, over the long term.  This administration has failed 

on the main thing that it needs to do, which is to tell us, how are 

we going to get out of this mess.   The composition of the 

stimulus is the fourth problem.  That was decided in the 

Congress.  It was a mistake by the Obama administration to let it 

be decided in the Congress, because the Congress was interested 

much more in the redistribution of wealth than it was in seeing 

jobs and the economy improved.   One-third of the stimulus went 

to state and local governments, for their deficits.  That may be 

good or bad policy, but it has very little stimulus.  It simply 

transfers the deficit from one place to another.   Also, a big piece 

of the stimulus went for a temporary tax cut.  We’ve had lots of 

evidence on temporary tax cuts.  The Bush administration, the 

Ford administration, the Carter administration, they all tried 

temporary tax cuts.   The economic evidence is, temporary tax 

cuts don’t do much.  The only major stimulating tax cuts that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 22. 

 

 

 

we’ve had in the post-war period were the Kennedy-Johnson tax 

cuts, and the Reagan tax cuts.  They were permanent tax cuts, 

people knew that once they got them, they were theirs.  

[APPLAUSE]   Finally fifth.  This program is so off the block.  Do 

you remember shovel-ready projects?  Well, only 25 percent of 

the dollars for the infrastructure have been spent.  Maybe that 

part of the program will do some good when it gets started, but 

the economy is in a slow recovery.   So that part of the program is 

hardly a success.  Now the economy has recovered, and the 

members of the affirmative tell us about how much better things 

are than they were a year ago.  But is that a result of the Obama 

policy, or is it the natural tendency of the economy when it sinks, 

when inventories get very low, to be rebuilt, because that’s where 

a lot of the third-quarter improvement came from, the rebuilding 

of inventories.  Very little of it in consumption.  Most of the 

recovery in the third quarter came from temporary clunkers, and 

housing.   The housing policy is full of corruption.  People come 

in and ask for the $8,000, they send their children, because 

they’ve already bought a house, they send their children to do it, 

the Washington Post had a long expose of the corruption in the 

housing problem.  I believe that we have the wrong policy.  The 

problem for the United States for the future, the problem that we 

are all going to face for a long time to come, is that we have a 

huge debt, that a lot of, part of it is owed to foreigners, and it’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 23. 

 

 

 

growing.   So, you don’t have be to an academic economist to 

figure out that the way we’re going to pay for that is to export.  

And the way to export more, would be to invest more, and earn 

our way out of that problem.  What the administration is doing is 

the wrong thing.  It’s trying to build up consumption.  

Fortunately, it isn’t being very successful.  Now the CBO, the 

Congressional Budget Office, says we have a debate explosion.   

It’s unsustainable.  It’s headed toward a debt crisis.  The 

Congressional Budget Office says that every 10-point increase, 

percentage point increase in the debt ratio, lowers GDP growth by 

a quarter percent.   This administration is increasing the debt by 

50 percentage points.  That’s a policy failure.  The government 

debt to GDP ratio was about 50 percent, when the administration 

took office.  The CBO trajectory says, it’s going to 700 percent.  

700 percent is not a point we’re going to reach, because it’s 

unsustainable.  That means, we’re headed, unless we do 

something about the exploding debt, we’re going to have a crisis.  

We absorb a considerable part of world savings, that too is 

unsustainable.  Why.  Well, the Bush drug bill.  The Obama 

health care bill.  A great many of the things that the Congress 

does, increase the deficit.  You can’t believe, that we’re going to 

cut Medicare by $500 billion in order to get the drug bill passed.  

But that’s what you have to believe, if you believe that this 

administration is going to give you health care without paying.

We are on an unsustainable policy, and it’s a failed policy.  Many 

years ago I started to tell people, capitalism without failure, is 

like religion without sin.  Governor Spitzer’s going to talk about 

that in the context—  [LAUGHTER]  In the context…in the context 

of the banking system—

Thank you.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  Vote no!   

[APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN  

Our motion is, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working 

Effectively.”  And our next debater, who will be arguing for the 

motion, Steve Rattner, who has gone through many careers.  He 

began as a journalist.  He switched to finance.  Good call, by the 

way.  [LAUGHTER]  And he recently had the beginning of a 

political career as a treasury official.  He came to the White 

House and was given the job of the auto rescue—the GM deal, 

that’s him.  The Chrysler deal, that’s him.  However, he does not 

like the term Car Czar, which is too bad, because it’s very 

musical.   

STEVE RATTNER 

Well, my paternal grandparents, who were fur peddlers in 

Moscow, would be rather shocked at the idea that I was a Czar of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 25. 

 

 

 

any kind, so I will...I don’t have anything to follow Allan Meltzer’s 

last remark, I’m afraid... [LAUGHTER]  But I was struck listening 

to the first two speakers from the other side.  I feel a little bit like 

Goldilocks.  I heard one speaker that we in the Obama 

Administration were too hot and I heard one sort of imply we 

were too cold.  And that makes me think we got it about right.  

[LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]   All kidding aside, I actually do want 

to make a serious point.  And with all due respect to the first two 

speakers from the other side, I want to try to take the ethereal 

world of theory and connect it to the real world of politics.  

Because I heard a few things that kind of, that did strike me.  I 

heard Jamie say, Congress must provide more resources.  We 

must resolve the toxic banks.  We can’t let it be decided by 

Congress.  Well, who else decides things besides Congress?  We 

have to stop the displacement of people from their homes.  I 

mean, these are all wonderful phrases but this is, as I found in 

my six months in Washington, not how the world works.  As 

Rahm Emanuel said the other day, It’s fine to imagine yourself 

sitting under a shady tree at the Aspen Institute thinking of great 

policies.   

 

But then eventually you have to come to grips with the real world 

and deal with it.  So you can say, people can say our stimulus 

program was not enough, but the fact is, as Larry said just at the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 26. 

 

 

 

end of his remarks, it was all Congress was going to pass.  There 

was no more there.  It took every ounce of political muscle that 

the administration had to get that.  You can say it was too much 

but I think as Larry Summers has said many times, when you 

are facing a potential disaster you err on the side of doing more, 

not less.  And they did as much as was possible.  So I just want 

to try to again connect back to this sort of real world of politics 

and of getting things done that was really one of the biggest 

surprises that I found coming to Washington.   

 

We may all talk about the President and say, It’s the President’s 

decision.  The President recommends this, the President does 

that.  But there is a little thing called Congress that has to be 

dealt with as well and that becomes a series of gives and takes 

and judgments.  And so when Jamie Galbraith says, All Obama 

did was two things:  the stimulus program and the low interest 

rates—which actually wasn’t even Obama.  That was the Federal 

Reserve—it’s really not fair.  I think the Obama Administration – 

and we’ll talk more about autos in a minute—but this Financial 

Regulatory Reform which has been put forward, this energy 

which has been put forward, this health care which has been put 

forward, this housing which has been put forward—all these 

problems that were unattended to for the last eight years, this 

administration is trying its hardest to address in a thoughtful, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 27. 

 

 

 

responsible way.  [APPLAUSE]   

 

Let me turn for a minute now to the auto sector as well because I 

think my two fellow panelists made very, very coherent and 

logical and I hope ultimately persuasive cases for why the rest of 

the policy actions that the administration took were thoughtful.  

And so let me talk for a second about autos.  Because it was an 

interesting area.  It’s one of the few areas where the President 

actually did have authority.  And so if you don’t like what the 

President did on autos, it’s fair to blame the administration for 

that because we didn’t have to go to Congress.  We had TARP 

money.  We didn’t have to deal with the Federal Reserve and the 

FDIC, except in one fairly minor way.  We were pretty free to act.  

And when we showed up we had a bunch of people from one side 

of the aisle saying, You’ve gotta let these companies fail.    

 

You’ve gotta let the market work.  I’m sorry I don’t have any 

quotes from Jamie, but I did see one quote from Allan when I was 

poking around where, when Lehman Brothers went out of 

business Allan said, No big deal.  It’s fine.  That’s the way--you 

should have consequences from capitalism.  That’s the way it 

should work.  And then a year later he said Lehman Brothers 

should have been saved.  And so we had a lot of people saying to 

us, Oh, just let the market work.  Well, I hope the people who 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 28. 

 

 

 

said, Let’s just let the market work, knew what that would have 

meant.  It would have meant that Chrysler and GM would have 

shut down by the end of March.  It would have meant that 

hundreds of suppliers would have gone out of business.  They all 

would have liquidated.  It would have meant that Ford would 

have stopped making cars because they wouldn’t have been able 

to get parts because their suppliers, many of them, would have 

been shut down.  And you would have had something like three 

million people out of work, mostly in the industrial Midwest right 

at the end of March, right when the economy was at its worst.    

 

So it’s fine to say, Let’s let the market work.  But again, let’s try 

to connect it back to the real world and what the real world 

consequences would be of letting that happen.  Then you had 

some people, frankly, on the other side who basically said, You 

can’t let these companies go bankrupt.  It would be catastrophic, 

it would be a disaster.  Nobody would buy cars.  They would 

eventually liquidate.  You can’t possibly do that.  But President 

Obama made the decision that we weren’t going to simply kick 

the can down the road, frankly, the way the previous 

administration had, and we were only going to inject money in 

the context of a fundamental restructuring that might have to 

include bankruptcy, which it ultimately did.  And we achieved 

unprecedented sacrifices from all the stakeholders—from the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 29. 

 

 

 

lenders, from the UAW, from the suppliers, from the dealers, from 

everybody who was affected—came to the table and, frankly, with  

a fair amount of muscle from the administration, participated in 

this restructuring.   

 

And the result of that was that today General Motors announced 

their earnings.  They’re still losing money but their performance 

was wildly better than anybody would have guessed.  They have 

forty-two billion dollars of cash in the bank at the moment and 

they are performing well ahead of the expectations that we had.  

They’re out of bankruptcy.  Chrysler is out of bankruptcy in 

alliance with Fiat.  So I think it is a very vivid example of a place 

where we weren’t too hot, we weren’t too cold.  We were very 

pragmatic.  We addressed the problem, we focused on it and we 

tried to come up with the best solution for all concerned.   

 

And I think that that exercise, which I was proud to be a small 

part of, was emblematic of the approach that this administration 

has taken.  Tim Geithner and Larry Summers, the two principal 

economic policy makers, have strong views of principle but they 

are experienced, they are pragmatic.  They know how to get 

things done.  They are balanced and they are very thoughtful.  

And I think that the approach that they have taken throughout 

this process has been enormously positive and has led to all the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 30. 

 

 

 

things that you heard Larry and Mark talk about in terms of 

bringing this country back from the abyss, bringing us back from 

a depression and getting us started down the road.  Of course, I 

think it was—I forget who on the other side said—47 percent of 

people think the economy is the most important issue.  Of course 

it’s the most important issue.  But that doesn’t mean we haven’t 

made good progress.  That doesn’t mean that disaster hasn’t 

been averted and those green shoots that people talk about have 

begun to sprout.  So I was very proud to be a part of that and I 

would simply say to you, Would you prefer this administration or 

the last administration or some other administration?  Because I 

think this administration has done awfully well.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Steve Rattner.  Our motion is, “Obama’s Economic 

Policies Are Working Effectively.”  And here as our final speaker, 

to argue against the motion:  Eliot Spitzer, the former Attorney 

General and Governor of New York—a man whose career has 

been marked much in headlines, some that were favorable, some 

that were not.  He is, however, at this point in the media himself, 

having become a financial columnist for Slate.  And I want to 

point out to our audience that when this debate was conceived, 

Eliot was actually going to argue the other side.  He was going to 

say the economic policies are working effectively.  He has 

switched sides now.  And Eliot, I hope in your opening remarks 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

you address the basic question:  What’s that all about?   

ELIOT SPITZER 

Sure.  Well, that was not a proposition, but thank you.  

[APPLAUSE]  First, first even, before I do that, John, well, let me 

just thank Allan Meltzer.  If I follow his logic I have found 

religion.  [LAUGHTER]  The short answer to your question is that 

I read Mark’s testimony.  I was going to say, Mark, Thank you 

very much.  We were on the same side and then I read his very 

persuasive testimony that he provided—testified before Congress 

a few weeks ago.  And he goes through point by point—and I’ll get 

to it in a moment—that the terror that we are facing, and how 

treacherous the shoals are that we are going to run up against in 

a very short order economically—and I said, My goodness, this is 

not working at all.  And so, Mark, thank you for persuading me.  I 

will distribute it at the end of the day and you can all be-- I think 

you will vote our side once you have read Mark’s testimony.   

MARK ZANDI 

[INAUDIBLE]    

ELIOT SPITZER  

I’m sure you will next time around.  Well, let me also say very 

clearly that the Obama Administration’s economic policies, in my 

mind, stand for continuity you can believe in.  We are still giving 

away vast sums of money to the same people with the same 

result so the bank profits are way up, unemployment is up, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 32. 

 

 

 

investment is not increasing, consumption is not increasing and 

we are not seeing any of the wise transformation in the 

fundamental structure of our economy that this crisis calls for.  

We all remember—[APPLAUSE]  We all remember Rahm 

Emanuel’s often-cited statement that a crisis is a terrible thing to 

waste.  Indeed, it is.  This crisis is the rare opportunity that we 

have to change the direction of our economy, an economy that 

has been sliding in the wrong direction for many years.   

 

On that proposition we would all agree.  And I think that Larry 

used a very prescient metaphor of an apartment house that is 

burning down.  And he would say that the Obama Administration 

came with fire hoses blazing and put out half of the fire.  Our 

perspective is they didn’t call the fire brigade from the next 

county, that they didn’t say, What can we do to stop the fire?  

What can we do from the air?  How can we add other fire 

retardants to turn this off and make sure that there is not a fire 

next time around?  And that is what we have to do, that failure 

structurally is what we are talking about.  Let’s deal with 

numbers just for a moment.  And these are numbers from Mark’s 

testimony.  They are there out online, of course.   

 

These are irrefutable numbers.  Unemployment up to 17.5 

percent, 26 million people, increasing at the rate of several 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 33. 

 

 

 

hundred thousand per month.  Yes, the 700,000 a month of that 

was when we were in free fall.  Right now we are still in free fall—

two hundred thousand.  There is not any affirmative news on the 

job front.  And I will get to General Motors in a moment in terms 

of what they stand for in terms of jobs.  Foreclosures:  

foreclosures are getting worse, not better.  Your testimony—and 

we all agree—2010 will be worse than 2009, which was worse 

than 2008.  Why?  Adjustable rate mortgages are going to reset 

next year.  Fewer and fewer home owners will be able to afford to 

make their mortgage payments.   That crisis continues unabated.  

And one of the things the Obama Administration did not do that 

it should have done was push for the legislative power to give 

judges the power to reform mortgages in the bankruptcy context.   

 

I, at that point, when I saw that, I said, How could they not do 

this?  It is fundamental, it is necessary, it is right.  It would help 

the middle class that we supposedly care about most 

fundamentally.  [APPLAUSE]  The number, by the way:  

foreclosures are up twenty-three percent this year over last year 

and it will get worse.  Commercial real estate, we care about it 

less, other than as it affects the banking community.  You in your 

testimony say hundreds of banks will go bankrupt next year as a 

result of the mortgages in the commercial real estate sector that 

simply cannot be refinanced—grossly undervalued, still

accounting gimmicks.  They are left, right and center.  We have 

not faced to it.  It will be a disaster.  Credit markets are 

dysfunctional.  Your word, we all agree with it.  Credit markets 

are dysfunctional.   

 

Small, medium sized businesses cannot borrow, simply cannot 

borrow, even though we have given trillions of dollars to the 

megabanks that came crawling to Washington, say, Please, 

please, please, we can’t pay our bonuses.  State and local 

governments—[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  We won’t even get into it 

cause I only have 2:52 left.  The AIG conduit payments to 

Goldman, the 12.9 billion, 100 percent on the counter party 

payments—absolutely outrageous.  Tim Geithner must explain 

this to the American public.  [APPLAUSE]   Absolutely 

outrageous.  State and local governments will be going bankrupt.  

They are down ten, 15 percent in their revenues.  We have 

handled it for one year.  They will go over a precipice next year.  

That will lead to the full-time shutdown of school districts, fire 

districts, community services.   

 

That is where we are seeing it because property values will 

plummet, property revenues will plummet.  Sales tax revenue, 

real estate revenues—all dramatically down.  General Motors 

today—Steve, you’re right.  GM had better numbers today.  Third

quarter they only lost $1.12 billion.  Congratulations.  We’re on 

the road to recovery.  [LAUGHTER]  Let me tell you something.  

Do you know where they saw signs of improvement?  Their China 

subsidiaries.  Look at, disaggregate the numbers, really read 

what happened.  China sales are up twenty, 30, 40 percent, first 

quarter to third quarter.  Sales in the U.S. down.  Next year’s 

market, they had been presuming under your plan 12 and a half 

million auto sales next year, calendar year 2010.  And the U.S. 

economy downgraded to eleven today.  Think about that and 

what that means.  They will not survive.  Chrysler will probably 

go over the cliff as well.  They’re going to be selling Fiats.  That’s 

their business model.  It won’t work.  Let’s be real about this.   

 

Manufacturing jobs, we are losing.  We have lost a third of our 

manufacturing jobs in the last decade.  They do not come back, 

ever.  You look month after month over the last decade, good 

times and bad, they do not come back.  It is worse now than it’s 

ever been.  That is the core of our economy.  We cannot all be 

lawyers and investment bankers.  We need clients.  [APPLAUSE]  

The clients are all gone.  It doesn’t work.  The fundamental error 

of this administration is that it is continuity.  They have 

embraced the Bush Administration view that if you solve the 

problem of big banks everything else flows from that.  They are 

wrong.  Too big to fail is too big.  They don’t get it.  The only two

Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Henry Kaufman, Mervyn King—every 

major academic has said, We must get rid of too big to fail.   

 

They refuse to cross that threshold.  Until they do we will not 

reform the financial services sector and that is where they have 

focused to the exclusion of virtually the entire rest of the 

economy.  They do not appreciate the power they had.  They do 

not know how to negotiate for the fundamental change.  We’ve 

been involved in what I call a regulatory charade, pretending the 

problem was lack of power.  And the regulators, they had the 

power, they chose not to use it.  Who were those regulators?  The 

same folks we’re now promoting and sitting there making these 

misguided policies.  It’s time for more fundamental change.  Call

“Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively”—before the 

debate 32 percent of you are for the motion, 29 percent against 

and 39 undecided.  That is where things started.  You will vote 

again at the conclusion and the team that has changed the most 

minds will be declared our winner.  Now, on to round two.  It’s 

our middle round and this is the round where the debaters go 

more head to head.  They’ll be taking questions from you, the 

audience, and from myself as well.  And I would like to start by 

lifting something from what Eliot Spitzer just said.  He came up 

with five words that more or less sum up their position—we are 

still in free fall.  Is it true?  Anybody on the team arguing for?    

MARK ZANDI  

I’ll take a crack at it.  No.  [LAUGHS]  In a word.  Do you 

remember back a year ago?  Do you remember?  That’s free fall.  

That’s when we were panicked, when there were runs on major 

banking institutions— Wachovia, Washington Mutual.  You were 

afraid to keep your money in your bank.  The stock market was 

in complete free fall.  Housing values were falling 5, 10, 15 

percent.  We were losing 700,000 jobs per month.  That’s free fall.  

Today, we’ve got stability.  The policies aren’t magic.  They can’t 

work overnight in a matter of a few months.  But look where we 

are today.  Think about the counter-factual.  Think about what 

the world would look like without these policy responses.  In my 

strong opinion, we averted what would have been another

depression.  Yes, this was a very severe recession, but we averted 

a depression.  So, no, we’re not in free fall.  We’re [UNCLEAR]    

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  I’d like to ask the audience to – with a show of 

applause, whether you find that point convincing.  Are we—

[APPLAUSE]  And now to the response of Eliot Spitzer.    

ELIOT SPITZER  

Well, let’s frame it this way for you, Mark.  There is the easy 

decision, which is to spend a ton of money.  We needed to do 

that.  We all knew we would.  I don’t think it mattered who the 

President was, and thankfully, obviously, I am a fervent 

supporter of the President.  We were going to spend a huge sum 

of money.  There are— 

JOHN DONVAN 

[OVERLAP]  Eliot, I just want to encourage you to get a little 

closer to your mic.   

ELIOT SPITZER 

I’m sorry.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thanks.    

ELIOT SPITZER  

[OVERLAP]  There are three questions that followed that actually 

matter.  Spending the money is the premise.  The first question is 

who pays for it.  And it’s not so obvious that it needs to be 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 39. 

 

 

 

exclusively the tax payers as opposed to those who are equity 

debt holders and indeed the former executives of the companies.  

Even though that would be a small number numerically, 

nonetheless, symbolically important.   So who pays, and we’ve 

gotten it wrong in that regard.  We have not gotten debt and 

equity to kick in sufficiently.  Two:  what reform do you get for 

the money you’re spending?  Because rebuilding the same 

façade, the same edifice that’s been broken will not get us 

anywhere.  [APPLAUSE]  And the primary grievance that I have 

with this administration is that we are spending the money 

rebuilding the same structures, the same decision making 

process that got us to what we are right now.  And third:  job 

creation is the most important metric out there.   

MARK ZANDI  

[OVERLAP]  That’s fourth, Eliot, fourth.  [LAUGHTER]    

ELIOT SPITZER  

Great, you’re an economist.  I was [UNCLEAR]  [OVERLAPPING

MARK ZANDI   

[OVERLAP]  Don’t fudge, now, don’t fudge.   

ELIOT SPITZER 

[OVERLAP]  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Mark, we had a premise and 

three questions. —

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  Wait, let me bring in Larry Mishel.   

ELIOT SPITZER 

So...  

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  Larry, what [UNCLEAR]  ...what you just heard?   

ELIOT SPITZER 

[OVERLAP]  [UNCLEAR]  [LAUGHTER]  But job, job creation—  

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  Eliot, let me, let me bring in Larry Mishel.   

ELIOT SPITZER 

Sure.    

LAWRENCE MISHEL  

Well, I really think it’s worth keeping two things separate.  One is 

the whole financial market issue, which is primarily the 

motivation of what you’re talking about, Eliot.  You’re talking 

about spending.   And then there’s the question of jobs and the 

Recovery Act.  And it seems to me that there was nothing 

foreordained that anyone who got elected was going to actually do 

what was done and put together a nearly eight hundred billion 

dollar package to go through Congress—They wouldn’t have been 

able to get it through Congress—and that was going to be able to 

move the needle as much as the needle has been moved.   Not 

that we’re to be satisfied.  I mean, you know, this is the-- my

friends that are fellow liberals—Jamie and Eliot—are basically 

arguing against the excellent is the enemy of the very, very good.  

And that is, in my mind, just not really— and especially to have a 

former elected official do that, just seems otherworldly to me, to 

tell you the truth.  [SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE]  You know, I’m 

a close observer of Washington.  I watched what the so-called 

moderates did in the Senate to that stimulus bill.  They took out,  

a substantial amount of aid to the states.  They took out a school 

modernization program that last summer could have actually 

rebuilt a lot of schools, created a lot of jobs.  And they stuck in 

there something that was going to be done anyway, which is the 

ANT relief, which is basically tax relief for wealthy income tax 

payers.  That in effect, is proof positive that they got as much as 

they could out of the political system.  If you wanted to get more 

you had to have a different Congress.  I don’t think there was a 

different political strategy.  I can [UNCLEAR]    

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  All right, let me bring in Jamie.  [UNCLEAR]    

JAMES GALBRAITH 

The question before the House is not whether in the very difficult 

political environment the President’s team did as much as they 

could.  The question before the House is, Are the policies working 

effectively?  That’s a question about the economy and not about 

the politics.  Let’s look at where we are.  Let’s try to come to grips 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 42. 

 

 

 

with the scale of the disaster.  What has happened here is that 

the financial wealth of the American middle class in their houses 

and in their 401k’s and their bank accounts, built up over six or 

seven decades, has largely evaporated.  It’s a colossal disaster.  

People who thought they were going to retire on their home equity 

aren’t going to have it.  Delinquency rates in the state of Florida 

are over 20 percent, foreclosures over 10 percent.  This is an 

incredible thing.  If we think now how many jobs we need to get 

back to where, to fill the hole by 2011 it’s more than five hundred 

thousand jobs a month, if something hasn’t happened since 

1950-51.  If we want to do it over five years it’s three million jobs 

over the course of each single year—something that I don’t 

believe has ever been achieved.  If we’re going to deal with the 

problem we have to think about the scale of policy that goes well 

beyond what the political environment in Washington is prepared 

to deal with and we have to persuade it to change.  Otherwise, we 

are not going to solve these problems.    

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  So let me bring that back to Steven Rattner,  [OVER 

SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE]  who is arguing for the motion, the 

policies are working.  And Steven, that’s an argument that they’re 

conceding, the rescue succeeded.  The canoe did not go off the 

cliff. But they’re saying going forward, that does not solve where 

we need to get to.

STEVE RATTNER 

Well, I don’t think any of us would disagree with that.  I think, 

without getting into a big semantic debate over the question, if 

the question were:  Is the economy in a happy place?, we’d all be 

on one side of the table.   The question in effect, in my mind, is, 

Has Obama put forward and tried to implement policies that will 

have a positive effect on the economy and move it in the right 

direction?  And I think, I hope we’ve all made a very clear, 

convincing case that it has, and will.  Nobody would disagree, you 

guys are great at giving us a litany of what’s wrong.  Eliot, you 

gave us six minutes and forty-five seconds of what’s wrong with 

the economy and I only heard one or two suggestions what to 

actually do about it.  I don’t know what your suggestion is about 

General Motors.  Is it to let it to go bankrupt and have a couple of 

million people out of jobs?  I don’t know what your suggestion is 

about Goldman Sachs and the derivatives contracts.  I don’t like 

it any better than you do.  Would you like the financial system to 

melt down the way Lehman Brothers did?  I don’t know what 

your suggestion is about how to fix regulatory reform, which the 

administration has put forward a proposal which is mired in all 

the Congressional politics around it.  And I guess, I’m surprised 

because you were Governor.  You know what it’s like up there.  

You were the, you showed up in Albany and said, Day one 

everything changes.  And it didn’t because you had the

legislature.  [APPLAUSE]   

ELIOT SPITZER 

Well, then let me, I’ll tell you exactly what I would have done.  It 

may take more than two minutes but I’ll limit it.  In terms of cars 

I would have said, No, we’re not going to just give billions of 

dollars to a shelvable company.  We will say we will buy five 

hundred thousand battery powered cars two years from now from 

whatever domestic producer, I don’t care whether it’s GM, 

Hyundai, Kia.  Produce it here, 80 percent produced 

domestically.  We want to stimulate that type of productivity.   

STEVE RATTNER 

[OVERLAP]  That’s— 

ELIOT SPITZER 

And, no, no, no.  And we will build the electric recharging 

stations, akin to what Eisenhower did, on the interstate system.  

Build a new infrastructure.  [APPLAUSE]  Create, take the money 

that we gave to Goldman and instead of saying, Here it is, 12.9 

billion—use it to create Felix Rohatyns in the infrastructure 

bank.  That is what we need, that’s where the dollars should have 

gone.  The dollars could have been used in many different ways.  

Instead, when we made these enormous transfers, based upon 

nothing more than the say-so that we need it—which they didn’t 

because they’ve said they didn’t have any exposure to the AIG 

CDS, situation.  They were fully hedged.  We didn’t ask for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 45. 

 

 

 

anything back.  It was the failure to ask for anything back that 

was fundamentally wrong and that is why we are left with the 

same system we had before.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Let me ask Allan Meltzer.  Aren’t, [APPLAUSE]  aren’t we, are we 

not better off with a GM in some form rather than no General 

Motors?   

MAN  

[OVERLAP]  Aren’t we?   

JOHN DONVAN 

Allan, Allan, are we not better off having some form of General 

Motors and people working there than no General Motors?   

ALLAN MELTZER  

I’m with Eliot.  We, what the country needs in a more general 

sense, not just confined to automobiles—what the country needs 

to do is think about the enormous debt that it owes to foreigners 

and how it’s going to pay them without bankrupting the country.  

And the only answer that exists is you have to export.  We have 

to export.  And in order to do that we have to invest.  And the 

right program was an investment program, not a consumption 

program, not a bailout program.  That was a mistake.  Now, they 

want to say the administration was great in pushing this 

program.  The administration made a mistake of letting the 

Congress write that program.  So instead of writing in a program 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 46. 

 

 

 

that the United States needs to solve its long term problem, the 

problems that you and I and everyone else are going to face for 

the next ten or twenty years, is how to handle that debt, how to 

get our exports up, how to get our consumption down—not how 

to get our consumption up.  That was a fundamental mistake.  

The administration made that mistake.  It should never have 

made that mistake because Larry Summers certainly should have 

known that the problem we’re going to have is how to finance 

that debt with more exports.  And that’s going to require greater 

investment.  And one of those investments is the kind of 

investment that Eliot was talking about.    

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  Okay, I want to come back to Mark.  [APPLAUSE]  I 

want to come back to you but I want to ask you to hold for just a 

minute.  We’re going to come back to Mark Zandi but I want to, 

at this point, get you ready to turn this over to you for questions.  

Reminding you of a couple of things.  When the microphone, we 

have ushers with microphones.  If you raise your hands and I 

spot you, I’ll signal that it’s for you.  The microphone will come to 

you.  I’m asking you to rise.   If you’re a member of the news 

media we ask that you to identify yourself.  And I want to remind 

you when you hold the microphone to hold it about one fist’s 

way, distance from your mouth so that we can hear you.  And the 

last thing is please ask a question.  We don’t want speeches and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 47. 

 

 

 

we are not asking you to debate with the debaters because we 

already have six and that’s even.  [LAUGHTER]  Mark Zandi, to 

respond.    

MARK ZANDI   

Well, just a fact, one fact and then two responses.  Just another 

statistic.  Household net worth, that’s the value of all the things 

that we owe less all the things that we owe.  This is our net 

worth.  It declined by $15 trillion between the peak in ’07 Q3 

through the bottom in ’08 Q4.  $15 trillion.  And just to give you 

a context, there’s about $60 trillion worth, at the peak there was 

about $60 trillion in household net worth.  Since the beginning of 

the year or since the administration’s inauguration, household 

net worth has risen by $5 trillion, $5 trillion.  So that obviously 

reflects the improvement in the equity markets, stock prices—at 

least as measured by the S&P 500—are up.  I didn’t look today 

but it’s up somewhere between 25 and 30 percent since he was 

brought into office.  And housing values have started to rise.  

They fell sharply through the beginning of the year down 30 

percent from the peak and now they’ve begun to rise.  So to me 

that’s a very important statistic because that’s our net worth.   

 

Now, two quick responses, one with respect to the deficit.  I think 

this is a legitimate concern.  Obviously, it is a critical concern 

that we had a $1.4 trillion deficit, at 10 percent of GDP in fiscal 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 48. 

 

 

 

year ’09.  And we’re going to run up a $1.2 trillion deficit at least 

in the current fiscal year.  These are big numbers.  But, you 

know, this was a Hobson’s choice for us.  It really was no choice.  

If the policy makers did not respond aggressively to this and use 

the resources the economy would still be in recession, the 

financial system would be in disarray and the cost to taxpayers 

measurably greater, measurably greater.  The deficits would be 

larger than they are.  So we really had no choice in this.  And I 

think, as well, the deficits are something that are the result of it.  

Now, finally, one other response.    

 

You know, in the efforts to shore up the financial system in the 

auto sector and other parts of the economy, we did get 

something.  We got equity in a lot of these companies.  And today 

GM said that they were going to begin repaying the loan that we 

made to them well before plan.  And in fact, here’s a prediction.  

This is what I do for a living.  I predict that at the end of the day 

we are going to get most of that money back, if not all of it, and in 

fact, many of the banks had repaid a lot of the loans, capital we 

took into the institutions and we’ve made money on that.  So I 

think when this is all said and done and over and done with, the 

cost will be measurably greater.  And that’s because we did get 

something when we did help them get through this period.

And the question I have for you is this:  How long will it take to

How long will it take for us in America to get off the backs of oil

policies are working effectively?  And if you can’t I’m going to 

have to pass.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

Well, I could do that, sir.  And I’ll do it very quickly.  My question 

is this:  It takes a long time to get the ship out of the mud.   As a 

sailor I know.  We’re stuck in the mud here.  How long do we feel 

it’ll take for the green economy to take effect?  Thank you.   

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  Good question.  Jamie, Jamie Galbraith.  

[BACKGROUND VOICES]    

JAMES GALBRAITH  

One of the misfires at the start of this process was the idea that 

you could handle the problem with a stimulus package that 

would work in a relatively short period of time, over a year or two.  

It’s not going to work that way.  In order to get out of this we are 

going to need to set a strategic direction for the economy and 

build institutions and programs capable of mounting a sustained 

effort over ten, fifteen, twenty years.  And the direction that we 

need to take is clearly in the line that you just indicated, in the 

line dealing with our energy problem, dealing with climate 

change, creating green jobs so that people have work to do that is 

useful for the country.  That was our institutional challenges that 

are on a par with the creation of the middle class in the New Deal 

in the post-war era.  And it’s just nothing short of that.  We need

Look, I want to wrap this back to this whole idea about cars and 

everything.  The green economy is an important part of the 

future—but I think Jamie and I might even agree on this—but it 

is the longer term future.  And the Obama Administration, I 

would argue, has all kinds of proposals that it is pushing 

vigorously to implement a green economy.  But we are kidding 

ourselves if we think the green economy is the solution to our 

immediate economic problems.  We are kidding ourselves if we 

think we could have let General Motors go bankrupt and built 

five hundred whatever it was that you said you wanted to build,

ALLAN MELTZER  

I believe— 

JOHN DONVAN 

[OVERLAP]  Allan Meltzer.   

ALLAN MELTZER  

...the transformation of the economy is the right thing to do.  And 

that’s what we should have done.  But the mistake was to allow 

the Congress to enact a, what was largely a redistributive 

program instead of enacting a program which was in the long 

term interest to the United States.  The United States is at a 

crucial point.  We are facing a crisis.  There’s a new book out that 

I commend to everybody.  It isn’t my book so I can commend it.  

[LAUGHTER]  It’s by Reinhart and Rogoff.  It traces crises since 

1300, especially since 1800.  I read the book and read the 

newspaper.  It’s hard to know when you’re reading the book and 

when you’re reading the newspaper.  Big debts, bailing out the 

banking system—we are headed for a crisis.  So we have to use 

our resources more wisely.  This is the twelfth recession in the 

post-war period.  All the others we recovered from quickly.  No 

one with any sense or knowledge believes we’re going to recover

quickly from this one.  That’s a failure of the policies that this 

administration has accepted from the Congress and is endorsing 

and pushing on you.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you.  The woman in the fourth row.  And Eliot, I see you

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  Eliot, why don’t you take the first question?   

ELIOT SPITZER 

Look, I don’t want to get into a prediction yet about a double dip.  

I think that on the other hand I will say this, that the data that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 55. 

 

 

 

we see is not encouraging in terms of spending.  I know that if 

you take away cars from the current consumer spending today it 

was up .2 percent, inventories are down.  All of those are negative 

data.  Your first question, which is the fundamental one, which is 

how do we begin to reform the financial services sector? that is 

where the fundamental disagreement that I have with the 

administration emerges.  Because they have spent such an 

enormous amount of effort and capital rebuilding the same 

edifice.  And those funds could have been used—Steve, this is 

where we disagree.  Of course we needed to preserve General 

Motors but what we also needed to do was invest.  And I agree, I 

think we, most of us would agree, that, yes, the deficit is a real 

issue.  I would have done the energy investments.  I would do 

more energy investments.  Having said that, those funds could 

have been used to confront the mortgage crisis.  Those funds 

could have been used to pay down some of the enormous 

mortgage overhang that is keeping consumers from being in a 

position to spend, from requiring the banks that received 

hundreds of billions of dollars in cash, trillions of dollars in loan 

guarantees, to step forward, to reform the mortgages.  That would 

have a fundamental impact on the state of our economy in terms 

of consumer spending, home net worth and the net worth of the 

families that we are caring about.  Instead, we simply gave the 

cash to these banks and where it is going is, to a great extent,

proprietary trading, overseas investment—all of which is 

economically worthwhile for them but not for the totality of our 

gross domestic product.  That is what we [UNCLEAR]   

JOHN DONVAN 

[OVERLAP]  And Mark Zandi, the point I would just—[APPLAUSE]  

The, Eliot is saying that the policy has rebuilt the machine that 

broke once, rather than figuring out a new design for a machine.    

MARK ZANDI   

Well, the financial services industry wouldn’t agree with that.  

They’re fighting financial regulatory reform very strongly.  They 

feel that these efforts aren’t in their best interest.  So I don’t think 

they would agree with that position.  [LAUGHTER]  And actually 

it is, well, quite substantive, the reform that is making its way 

through Congress.  You know, there is a lot of debate but broadly 

speaking, a number of things are going to come out of this.  First, 

the number of regulators that oversee the financial system will be 

rationalized.  One of the problems we had in the previous 

regulatory structure was that there was just too many regulators 

and financial institutions could shop for the regulator or avoid 

regulation altogether.   

 

And so there is an effort to address that.  There is also an effort 

to fashion a systemic risk regulator that can look across the 

entire financial scene.  Another problem we had in this current 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 57. 

 

 

 

financial crisis is that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury did 

not have the ability to quickly resolve cases like Lehman 

Brothers, which were not bank holding companies at the time.  

And then, third, also very important, the effort to establish a 

consumer financial protection agency.  The idea is establishing 

an FDA for financial products because I think it’s clear from the 

crisis that many people who got loans really did not understand 

the loans that they were getting and that caused greater 

problems.  So, and I’m quickly summarizing for you.  But the 

scope of the reform—  

JOHN DONVAN  

 [OVERLAP]  That was about two minutes, actually.    

MARK ZANDI   

...is—Yeah, sorry—is very significant and the system will be very 

different at the other end of this.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Let’s have—Sorry.   

ALLAN MELTZER  

[OVERLAP]  Yes.  Well, when we talk about— 

JOHN DONVAN 

Allan, let me get to Allan Meltzer.   

ALLAN MELTZER  

...the administration, this administration as trying to do 

something about the banking system, the financial system, is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 58. 

 

 

 

laughable.  What they’re doing is putting it back where it was, 

only it’s bigger now because there have been more mergers.  We 

have for thirty years, through various administrations, had too 

big to fail.  Too big to fail is not something that just came with 

history.  It came from the 1970s and it grew and grew and grew.  

Now what is too big to fail?  It is a system in which the bankers 

make the profits and you, the citizens, take the losses.  That’s not 

a good system.  The Federal Reserve—[APPLAUSE]   It’s not good 

for you and it’s not good for the country.  And the reason is 

because it encourages risk taking, excessive risk taking, by some 

bankers -- not all bankers, but by some bankers.  You—

ALLAN MELTZER  

[OVERLAP]  I just  [UNCLEAR]   

STEVE RATTNER 

I’ll make a couple of very quick points.  And I don’t want to be an 

apologist for the financial services industry, even though I spent 

twenty-six reasonably happy years in it.  But let, but I was not at 

a TARP bank.  I was not at Goldman Sachs.   Let me just say a 

couple of quick things.  First, to say that nobody in the financial 

system has suffered any pain, you should ask the people who 

worked at Lehman Brothers.  You should ask the people who 

work at Citigroup, you should ask the people who worked at 

Wachovia, they—  [APPLAUSE]  Most of them had huge amounts 

of their net worth in those firms.  Ask people who didn’t get 

bonuses last year, Goldman Sachs is Goldman Sachs but a lot of 

people in the financial services industry took a lot of pain.  The—   

ALLAN MELTZER 

But that isn’t the issue, it’s the public that’s taking the big loss.  

[APPLAUSE]   

STEVE RATTNER 

Well, no, no, no, no.  No, that is not true, because as Mark just 

said, I think when the dust settles, I think you will find that the 

government actually did pretty well on a lot of these investments.   

Maybe not AIG, we can debate AIG.  But the money they put into 

Goldman Sachs and into Morgan Stanley, first of all was 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 60. 

 

 

 

involuntary, those banks didn’t even want the money, the 

government forced them to take the money because they didn’t 

want the weak banks to stand out, and a lot of them as Mark 

said have already repaid it.   And let me just make one last point 

about too big—actually two last points, one about too big to fail.  

Too big to fail, you know, it’s not about repealing Glass-Steagall, 

it’s not about saying you can’t have more than this amount of 

assets.   Many of you will remember LTCM, which went under in 

1998 if I remember correctly, most people never heard of LTCM, 

it was probably not in the top 50 size of institutions and it almost 

brought down the entire financial system.  I’m all for fixing these 

problems but let’s do it thoughtfully, not with a meat axe.    

ELIOT SPITZER 

Well, speaking—   

JAMES GALBRAITH 

When—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Let, let—Jamie, I stifled Jamie—   

JAMES GALBRAITH 

When Allan said it was the public taking the losses, he didn’t 

mean the government budget.  He meant the citizenry of the 

United States, they’re the ones who have taken the losses in this 

matter.  [APPLAUSE]  As Mark Zandi already pointed out.   The 

question here, is, again as Eliot has said, do we restore the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 61. 

 

 

 

existing banking system, or do we truly reform it.  And that 

means having a system which is more competitive, better-run, 

easier to regulate, and led by a regulatory structure which is 

effective  at monitoring and preventing the kinds of massive 

frauds, particularly in mortgage origination, and in the ratings 

process, and all through the process that led to this incredible 

disaster.   That requires having enforcement mechanisms that 

work, and going after the perpetrators as was done, in the 

resolution of the savings and loan crisis, when, I should remind 

you, about 1,000 industry insiders were convicted of federal 

felonies and went to jail—

called the Fed.  They just didn’t do their job.  The question

Okay.  We’ve talked about how there’s some systemic issues out

the American consumer is consuming too much and I think 

that’s pretty much a—I think that’s an issue that’s been going on 

for decades where the—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, sir, I—please get to a question—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

My question is that, do you think there is a systematic issue that 

has been built because of the inequality of wealth out there 

where the 1 percent, who, basically control  the market, there has 

never been a capitalist market, it’s the 1 percent that controls the 

market, there’s no transparency, do you think, there’s a big issue 

because there’s been a massive… there’s a massive inequality in 

wealth distribution in this country and that’s going to create

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 65. 

 

 

 

issues.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Jamie Galbraith.   

JAMES GALBRAITH  

It bears very closely to the question of ineffective economic policy.  

If you try to have the economy recovery by shoring up those few 

at the top it simply isn’t going to work, it didn’t work in 1929, it’s 

not going to work now.   What you have to do is to have a 

program which effectively provides employment, income, and 

security to the entire population of the United States.  That’s 

where you need to begin.  Going about it the other way is simply 

going about it backwards, and doomed not to succeed.   

LAWRENCE MISHEL 

Right, can I weigh in on this?  

JOHN DONVAN 

Yes, Larry Mishel.  [APPLAUSE]    

LAWRENCE MISHEL 

I absolutely think that the massive inequalities in our nation, 

were the precondition for the crisis that we’re in right now.  And I 

believe that the Obama administration’s plans actually do 

address many of the issues, not all the issues going forward, to 

try to resolve that.   Part of it is to develop a productive economy 

based on a non-carbon-based economy, part of it is to address 

changes in our basic labor markets, to have enforced labor laws 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 66. 

 

 

 

and the basic wage and hours type things, to be able to restore 

the right to have unions, to raise the minimum wage.  We are, 

they are also pursuing having universal health care, which is a 

mechanism for distributing income throughout the population, 

and security, and to try to do they can to try to get 

unemployment down as fast as they can which I think is in fact 

what the policy is.  So I think that moving forward, building an 

economy where we’re not having growth based on asset bubbles 

and consumer debt, is really important, and that the only way to 

do that is to have wages growing in line with productivity, and to 

have more economic security, and I think that if Mr. McCain had 

been elected we would be nowhere on that agenda.  With Mr. 

Obama, I think we’re around 75 percent on the right track 

towards that agenda—    

JOHN DONVAN  

All right.  Ma’am, I—you used the question about the dollar, and 

I think I was too abrupt, and I apologize.  Was your question, 

looking at the dollar today, is it an indicator of his success, is 

that what you were getting at—   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Yes, exactly, that’s why I wanted one of the gentlemen on the 

panel on the left to answer—    

JOHN DONVAN  

Well you’re back in, and I’m sorry—

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Okay—  

JOHN DONVAN 

—about before…   

PANELIST  

Well, uh—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Well, let me put in Mark Zandi, take that.  

MARK ZANDI 

Well, I think the decline in the dollar that we’ve observed recently 

over the last six to nine months is entirely appropriate, and 

actually it’s been very orderly.   Entirely appropriate and a net 

positive for our economy, at least so far, that, yes, it has resulted 

in somewhat higher commodity prices in the one commodity that 

matters the most--is the price of oil for all of us.   But that 

negative has been offset by an increase in exports.  A source of 

growth in our economy.  It was a very significant negative back in 

the free fall, a year ago, nine months ago, but is now growing 

again in part because of the better global economy, in part 

because of the weaker dollar.   Also it’s helped corporate profits, a 

lot of companies that operate overseas are benefiting from the 

dollar, so it’s a net positive, now, I do think if you look further 

out, and the dollar begins to decline in a disorderly way for 

whatever reason, that would be a problem, but so far, no 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 68. 

 

 

 

problem, very good.   

JOHN DONVAN 

James Galbraith.   

JAMES GALBRAITH 

Very briefly, I’m not a deficit Cassandra, I’m not a public debt 

Cassandra and I’m not a dollar Cassandra.  These issues are 

often used to make the argument that you simply can’t do what 

needs to be done in order to bring the economy back on track 

and overcome our unemployment crisis.   And I don’t think they 

are valid objections.  So from that point of view actually Mark and 

I don’t have an analytical difference, I would just simply say that 

the dollar will go where it’s going to go. It’s not going—the 

international monetary system will probably not collapse, and 

certainly not as the result of an effective effort to restore the 

American economy.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Gentleman in the center?    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Yes.  I think very few people here would disagree that there’s 

more that should be done, in terms of correcting the systemic 

problems that exist in this country.  The question before the 

group though, is whether Obama’s policies are working 

effectively.   Which brings us back to the problem of dealing with 

Congress.  Where you have many people, when you talk about, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 69. 

 

 

 

you know, making more green jobs, you have many people in 

Congress, far too many who deny that global warming is even a 

problem.  We have people who are in Congress—  

JOHN DONVAN 

I need you get to a question now.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

The question is, what would the panelists do, to try to implement 

the change that they’re talking about, dealing with the Congress 

we presently have.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN  

Steve—Steve Rattner, you described what passed is almost a 

miracle because of the Congress— because of Congress and 

because of—   

MAN 

I’m sorry, what was it—   

JOHN DONVAN  

You described the fact that the stimulus package passed as—  

STEVE RATTNER 

Yeah, it was almost a miracle—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—as itself, a rare miracle.    

STEVE RATTNER 

I think this is in all seriousness a huge issue for the country to 

think about, and, you know, there’s this great quote of Jefferson’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 70. 

 

 

 

where he says if I had to choose between a government without 

newspapers or newspapers without a government, I would choose 

newspapers without a government.   And I say that not because 

I’m advocating newspapers but, the whole concept when you get 

to Washington of realizing what Jefferson had in mind when he 

designed or was part of designing our system, the Capitol’s on the 

hill, the White House is down at the bottom.   Article I of the 

Constitution is the Congress, it’s not the executive branch.  The 

power that the Congress has is formidable and it was created in 

an era where we weren’t going to be dealing with toxic assets and 

we weren’t going to be dealing with regulatory reform,  and we 

weren’t going to be dealing with green jobs, and it’s a real 

problem, I think as I’ve tried to argue that I think President 

Obama has done as effective a job as humanly possible in 

promoting a responsible agenda through Congress.   But if you 

take something like reg reform—financial regulatory reform, not 

to use the jargon, it is mired in a series of intra-Congressional 

jurisdictional disputes over who would be in charge of this 

agency or that agency if you happen to pass something.  It is a 

very broken system.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Eliot Spitzer.    

ELIOT SPITZER  

Yeah, see Steve, we agree about the merits or demerits of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 71. 

 

 

 

legislative branches, I think we would agree on that point clearly.  

Having said that…  [LAUGHTER]  Having said that, the question 

is what role does the executive play in defining the parameters of 

the debate.   When it comes to regulatory reform as it relates to 

financial services, the President did not strike a position, did not 

articulate a position that said very clearly, here’s where we must 

go, which is what FDR did.   FDR rewrote the rulebook, this 

President unfortunately embraced the existing rule structure, 

moved jurisdiction around marginally without saying the 

fundamental predicate of the issue, too big to fail, must shift.  He 

hasn’t yet done.   Let me switch gears since you raised the 

metaphor of Albany.  When we went to Albany, I did in fact on 

health care, fundamentally go to war with the entrenched 

interests about how health care would be delivered.   We had an 

enormous battle, and we bent that curve in a very significant 

way.  You can do it, it’s a question of articulating, drawing lines 

in the sand, you won’t win everything.  The President has been 

admirable in many respects, but when it came to financial 

services in particular, he did not embrace the fundamental 

change that was needed.

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Larry touched on this earlier, it would seem to me that, if you’re 

talking about Obama’s policies, you have to talk about not only 

the legislation that has been passed, but what is proposed.  

Small bus—and that would be including health care which is 

being debated now.   Cap-and-trade legislation, the expiration of 

the tax cuts, the Bush tax cuts, and labor law changes including, 

a card check, and…the way you would adjudicate disputes 

between labor and management.  Small business is going to—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Yeah, I need you to ask a question, sir.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Does anybody think this is going to have any impact, the 

overhang of these things on the creation of jobs going forward?  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 73. 

 

 

 

The uncertainties created and the costs involved?   

JOHN DONVAN 

Larry Mishel.   

LAWRENCE MISHEL 

Well, I think that these kinds of policies are exactly what’s 

needed to build the economy we need to come out of this 

recovery.  We need an economy which provides broadly shared 

prosperity, this is something that we haven’t had in 30 years.   

Prior to 2007 the prior 20 years or so, some 56 percent of all the 

income gains went to the upper 1 percent.  That is not 

acceptable.  It is also the predicate to the kind of crisis that we’ve 

had, because we can only have a robustly growing economy that’s 

sustainable if people are able to earn good wages and be able to 

spend based on those wages without going into debt or relying on 

asset bubbles.  So I do think small business ideology says that 

these are not going to be good for them, but in fact it will be good 

for them, because it’s going to create a robust consumer economy  

that’s going to create a lot of different jobs, and that’s going to 

start benefiting everybody for once and for all.  

JOHN DONVAN 

Jamie Galbraith.    

JAMES GALBRAITH 

Well…I support health care reform, I support a strong energy and 

climate program, I support financial reform considerably stronger

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

than the administration is proposing.  I don’t think anybody 

argues, I don’t think the President argues, that those three things 

amount to an economic recovery program, sufficient to create 

let’s say three million jobs a year over five years, that’s not even 

close.   That’s the issue that’s before us, have we done enough, 

are we doing enough to deal with the problem, that the 

population of the United States faces, answer to that question is, 

no.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Eliott Spitzer—    

ELIOT SPITZER  

I would just add very quickly one footnote to that, it’s perhaps 

not a footnote, credit to small business is where we are stumbling 

most dramatically.  You cannot get loans if you’re a small 

business owner or entrepreneur.  The reason for that is that all 

the capital went to the megabanks, and what they’re doing with it 

does not permit small businesses to grow.  That is the egregious 

macro-error that the administration’s making.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN  

And the concludes Round 2 of our debate.  [APPLAUSE]  And 

here’s where we are, we are about to hear brief closing 

statements from each debater, two minutes each, and it’s their 

last chance to change your minds, and as we’ve said all along 

this is a debate of persuasion,  you have been asked to vote 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

before the debate began and you’ll be asked to vote again after 

the debate, the team that changes the most minds will be 

declared the winner and to remind you of the results of the 

preliminary vote, our motion is “Obama’s Economic Policies Are 

Working Effectively,”  32 percent of you are for this motion, 29 

percent of you are against, and 39 percent are undecided.  You’ll 

be asked to vote one more time, and that will decide our winner 

just a few minutes from now.   But first, Round 3, closing 

statements, we’re going to begin with Jamie Galbraith, James 

Galbraith, economist and professor of government and business 

relations at the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Public 

Affairs.    

JAMES GALBRAITH  

Our side in this debate has presented an emphatic call for action.  

The other side has asked you to accept excuses.  Excuses for the 

inadequacy of action so far.  Maybe a little unfair but I know that 

tomorrow morning the Economic Policy Institute is going to issue 

with a broad coalition a major call for action.   It’s exactly what 

we need, to deal with the gap in action today.  Yes, the Congress 

is an obstacle.  I worked for the Congress for 10 years, I know 

how difficult it can be.  I was there though, in 1981 when Ronald 

Reagan rolled the Congress, [APPLAUSE] and I would like to see 

once in my professional life, once in my life, for someone on our 

side to do the same.  [APPLAUSE]   This is a dangerous moment.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Obama’s Economic Polices Are Working Effectively” Page 76. 

 

 

 

The cost of inadequacy is extremely high.  If the program falls 

short, then the political situation, the political momentum, will be 

lost.  If people see results for the bankers, and not for 

themselves…  they see recovery in the stock market, but not in 

the value of their homes, they will turn away from all sensible 

measures.  It will discredit everything the administration is in 

fact trying to do.  Can you err by doing too much, the prospect is 

extremely remote and if you did you could always pull back.   It’s 

exactly the kind of boldness that is needed, to confront the 

situation that we do not have yet and that we could only hope will 

develop in the next stage of policy of this administration.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, James Galbraith.  [APPLAUSE] Summarizing for our 

motion, “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively,” 

summarizing for this motion, Mark Zandi, chief economist and 

co-founder of Moody’s Economy.com.    

MARK ZANDI  

Yeah, you know, to me, I think people lose sight of the severity of 

the situation that we’ve been in, the crisis that we’ve just gone 

through.  The panic and the Great Recession, it truly, it is the 

longest deepest, broadest-based recession since the Great 

Depression, there’s no--all the statistics are very clear on that.   

And I think the administration has been thrust into this, in the 

middle of it, and has been all about trying to bring an end to that

crisis, to quell the crisis, to quell the panic, to bring an end to the 

Great Recession, and here we are, you know, nine months into 

this administration, and look.  The panic has been quelled.  We’re 

still nervous, we’re still cautious.  We haven’t gotten our groove 

back.  [LAUGHS]  But, just think where we were, the Great 

Recession is over.   The Great Recession is over, yes, it’s not fully 

engaged.  Businesses went through near-death experiences, 

they’re not going to forget that and step out and start hiring 

immediately, you know.  Policy isn’t magic.  It’s not magic.   But 

the recession is over and we’re moving in the right direction.  

Now.  It’s fair to say that we need to do more.  Absolutely.  You 

know, but the proposition is, are the Obama administration’s 

economic policies working effectively, working.   No one’s saying 

they’ve worked, that we’re done, that this is a work in progress, 

that the script hasn’t been written, and the administration as got 

a range of policies that it’s put forward, tough policies on difficult 

issues, things that we hadn’t been able to address, health care, 

financial regulatory reform, energy policy, tax reform, a budget 

deficit that’s been a problem for many, many years, and look, 

we’re starting to discuss it and that to me is proof positive that, 

they are working and we’re working in the right direction.  Thank 

you.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Good—thank you, Mark Zandi.  [APPLAUSE]  Making his

summary statement against the motion, Allan Meltzer, university 

professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon.    

ALLAN MELTZER  

The subject is, are we… working, is this administration’s program 

working.  The forecasts for the future, this is the 12th I think 

recession in the post-war years.  We recovered from most of 

them.  Most forecasts for the future say, the unemployment rate 

is going to stay up in the 10 to 11 percent range for a couple of 

years now.   That’s not what I call working.  The banking system, 

the financial structure, is unreformed.  In addition to that, 

something we haven’t talked about, the administration has made 

threatening moves in the trade area.   The World Trade 

Organization produced the greatest growth in world history, more 

people, in more countries, had their living standards raised by 

larger amounts in the post-war years, than at any time in 

mankind’s recorded history.  They did that by reducing tariffs.   

The administration has increased tariffs on tires, steel pipes, next 

coming, coated papers, and other items.  China is retaliating, by 

putting restrictions on auto imports.  That’s a disaster.  A bad 

policy.  Not a policy that is going to produce growth in jobs and 

improvements in the United States.  It’s a policy which is going to 

make the world poorer.

JOHN DONVAN  

And, summarizing for the motion, “Obama’s Economic Policies 

Are Working Effectively,” Larry Mishel, president of the Economic 

Policy Institute.   

LAWRENCE MISHEL  

If the future is grim…and I agree with Allan Meltzer that in fact 

there is going to be persistently high unemployment, that’s 

unacceptable.  Is that the Obama’s administration fault?  Is that 

the fault of the kind of policies that actually Allan himself and 

conservative allies have advocated for many different years.  

[APPLAUSE]   To my liberal friends…  What— I’ve said that there 

was an apartment building on fire, and Eliot says, well maybe 

there were some fire trucks in the next county that could’ve 

actually helped put out the fire, in fact, I can tell you that he 

hasn’t named any other county which had the fire trucks, and 

what they would do, or said how they would get around the 

roadblock of the Republican moderates in the Senate that 

actually blocked an even more effective stimulus that was 

actually on the table.   In my view, there’s been, and I have not 

been an Obama supporter from day one of that campaign, I’m far 

from in the bag for the Obama administration, I’m to the left of 

the Obama administration, okay?  [APPLAUSE]   I’ve been 

surprisingly pleased, much more pleased than I ever thought I 

would be by the direction of what they did with the recovery plan,

much larger, well-designed in terms of putting out some money 

early that got things going.   Some back-end public investments 

for energy alternatives, infrastructure, science, training, 

education, et cetera, I think very well-designed and smart.  A lot 

of their other policies are directly on target, they’re trying to do 

big, bold things.  I’m quite surprised and quite pleased, you 

should be as well.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Summarizing against the motion, Eliot Spitzer, former governor 

and Attorney General of New York.   

ELIOT SPITZER  

Well first of all, thank you all, this has been spirited fun and we 

probably disagree less than some of the rhetoric tonight would 

suggest but let me say this, I’m tired of hearing blame pushed to 

Republicans in Congress.  We as Democrats have a majority in 

both houses, it’s about time we used them.  [APPLAUSE]   It’s 

about time we stood up and used our majority.  It can be done, 

and we should do it.  Let me tell you where the fire trucks are, 

the fire trucks are the billions, hundreds of billions of dollars that 

were given to the wrong banks for the wrong reasons, that were 

not used to invest in the infrastructure, to invest in jobs, in 

mortgage reformation.   That could’ve had a fundamental effect 

on our economy and that’s what we should have done.  The fire

trucks take the form of not demanding reform of those who 

received the money.  Not making them pay for the benefit of 

receiving tax dollars in return for a reformed regulatory structure, 

and the fire trucks take the form of not investing in jobs for the 

future.  I am worried, I think Mark is exactly right.  Some of the 

nervousness is gone.   The nervousness is gone primarily because 

of what the Bush administration did, pushing a lot of money to 

the banks.  That wasn’t the Obama administration.  But precisely 

because the nervousness is gone, the moment for the 

fundamental reform we need is passing.   And rather than 

galvanize that urge for reform, rather than push for the 

fundamental reform that we need in terms of jobs, investing in 

education, investing in health care, driving up the average wages 

of workers, the administration is reinvesting in the status quo,  

primarily a financial services sector, based upon the incorrect but 

maybe it’s a benign interpretation, the incorrect belief that 

putting the money there will generate the jobs.   As I said, those 

manufacturing jobs will not come back, General Motors today 

said, they don’t anticipate hiring more workers in the United 

States.  Overseas they will.   So yes, Steve, we agree, we needed a 

bailout, but that’s not where jobs are coming from, jobs will come 

from small-medium business, banks should lend to them but the 

banks that would lend to them don’t have the capital, because all 

the capital went to the megabanks that are not going to lend to

them anyway.  That was the critical mistake.  Thank you all for 

being here.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Finally summarizing for the motion, Steve Rattner, who led the 

administration’s efforts to restructure the auto industry.    

STEVE RATTNER 

So Eliot, let me see if I have this right, the mistake we made was 

quenching the fires of financial crisis which took away the 

urgency to do anything about it so we should restore the financial 

crisis so there is some desire to do something about it, is that 

right?  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]    

ELIOT SPITZER  

Use it properly.  A crisis is a terrible thing to waste—   

STEVE RATTNER 

My—  Wait a minute, wait a minute, I—   

JOHN DONVAN 

That is really against the rules—   

STEVE RATTNER 

This is my chance to—   

JOHN DONVAN 

There is two minutes—  

STEVE RATTNER 

—to have a last word without you saying anything.   So I want to

say that the only systemic authority that the federal reserve 

would’ve had to bail out Lehman Brothers, would’ve been to bail 

out Lehman Brothers exactly what you don’t want to have 

happen, so there was no authority to deal with Lehman Brothers.   

One more comment to you before I leave you alone for a second, 

[LAUGHTER]  this idea that we have—and to Jamie as well—the 

idea we have a majority in Congress, yes, we have a majority in 

Congress, it is very much in name only.  We created, our political 

leaders, a big tent in order to have those majorities.  That tent 

spans a lot of ideologies and it is very difficult to marshal 

majorities let alone the 60 votes you need in the Senate where 

there are two independents, to get something done, and you guys 

make it sound easy, it is not, it is not easy, you make everything 

sound easy, you tell us—  [LAUGHTER]   You know, just wave 

your magic wand and you’ll have financial regulatory reform, it’s 

not that easy.  You’ve also set up a false dichotomy, you’ve said 

that, you’ve raised this question of whether or not we should 

have more action, of course we should have more action, we all 

agree that we should have more action.  The question is, what is 

responsible, how do you get it done, and what makes good sense.  

And I would argue what I said before, I won’t repeat it all, that 

this administration’s put forward responsible policies in every 

area.   Is financial regulatory reform is it what I would do or what 

Eliot would do, left to our own designs, no.  But is it something

that they spent a lot of time vetting with Congress people to try to 

come up with something that had a change of passage so that we 

would actually get something done as opposed to getting nothing 

done, it’s back to Larry’s don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the 

good.   They did, and they have something out there, they have 

walked the walk, they’ve talked the talk.  And what I frankly have 

heard tonight from the other panel, is, let’s just go do it and let’s 

pretend we’re at the Aspen Institute or the Brookings Institution, 

it’s just not how it works.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

And, that concludes closing statements for this debate.  And now 

it’s time to learn which side argued best, who are our winners, 

we’re going to ask you one final time to go to the keypad on your

things.    Our winner tonight of Quote of the Night, Mark Zandi, 

“Policy is not magic.”  Congratulations to you.  [APPLAUSE]  Just 

the yawner.  Just the yawner.  I want to thank—I really do want 

to thank the audience, and especially our panelists for a very 

spirited debate if we could give them a round of applause.
