John Donvan: 
Throughout the evening, because we're broadcasting for radio, I'll be doing a number of 
formal repetitions of particular phrases that's might become tiresome to you.  But just 
so you know, I'll be telling you again and again what my name is, for example, when we 
come back from breaks and in a couple situations I may ask you to break spontaneously 
into applause to come back from a break.  So you'll know that it's spontaneous because 
I've told you to do so. 
 
[laughter] 
 
I would like to introduce with great respect and appreciation the founder of Intelligence 
Squared U.S. who has made all of this possible and who will be framing the debate for 
us tonight, Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, thank you very much, and thank you for joining us this evening.  Now, I have a day 
job, and it's running an insurance company.  We cover some 8 percent of the U.S. work 
force for long-term disability and serious workplace injuries.

So we see, first hand, that obesity is a major factor in driving claims costs, particularly 
those related to serious traumatic injuries.  The most obese have substantially higher 
incident rates of diabetes and chronic heart disease as well.  But does this necessarily 
mean that lower weight produces better health outcomes for everyone?  Do the 
moderately overweight need to go on crash diets or otherwise modify their eating 
habits?  When the government defines terms like "overweight" and "obese," do those 
particular weight levels have any demonstrable connection with health outcomes?  The 
first lady has made childhood obesity her signature issue.  But interestingly, the 
administration does not want to join the debate tonight.  We're disappointed that the 
current surgeon general was required to withdraw from the debate, but delighted that 
her predecessor, David Satcher is with us.   
 
18:51:49 
 
He was actually the first to sound the alarm over obesity.  So this brings me to the crux 
of tonight's debate.  If obesity is indeed a serious public health issue, what, if anything, 
should the government do about it?  Well, at a minimum, it can stop doing harm.  Farm 
subsidies are targeted at producers of corn syrup and beef, for example, but not at 
producers of fruits and vegetables.  School lunch programs are festooned with 
regulations that fly in the face of nutritional common sense.  Aside from its sins of 
commission, can the government actively make things better?  Should we embrace 
ideas from Britain to treat parents of obese children as abusive or neglectful and then 
haul them into court?  Do calorie disclosures and requirements for healthy menu 
choices really change eating habits?   
 
18:52:46 
 
Indeed, are there any government obesity programs that in fact produce measurable 
health benefits in a cost effective way?  As usual, the issues tonight are complex.  
Fortunately, we have some outstanding panelists to shed light on them.  And it's my 
pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, John Donvan.  Thank 
you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Thank you.  And I'd just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert 
Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
Yes or no to this statement:  Obesity is the government's business.  We all eat, but do 
we do it wisely and well?  Well, obviously not.  So who is supposed to fix that?  Well, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 3 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

that's what we're going to have out here tonight.  This is another debate from 
Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four superbly qualified debaters, 
two teams of two, who are ready to get started.   
 
18:53:46 
 
We'll have three rounds of debate, and then the audience will vote to choose the 
winner, and only one side wins.  And as we go into it and meet our debaters, ponder this 
thought:  At one point in our history, the surgeon of the general of the United States 
raised the alarm about the number of Americans who were underweight.  That was Dr. 
Hugh Cumming.  He was the sixth surgeon general, and it was 1925.  And he certainly 
thought it was the government's business that Americans were getting too few calories.  
So what happened? How did we get to this world where Americans are getting too 
many calories?  Our motion is, "Obesity is the government's business."  And arguing for 
this motion, I'd like to introduce this team first, first Dr. David Satcher, who is the 16th 
surgeon general of the United States. And Dr. Satcher, you were the first to raise the 
alarm in 2001 about the obesity epidemic.   
 
18:54:44 
 
And I want to just ask you very briefly, at that point, did you see us reaching this point 
where the numbers are where they are today? 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Well, it was sort of a surprise when we saw what had happened over a 20-year period 
and the direction that we were going in terms of increasing obesity.  So we didn't know 
how long it would take to begin to turn what we call the epidemic around. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Dr. David Satcher.  And your teammate, Dr. Pamela Peeke, you started out 
life as a critical care doctor, and then you went back to school to learn nutrition.  
Motivated by what? 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
I became a Pew Foundation scholar in nutrition and metabolism because in medical 
school, I learned nothing.  I didn't have a minute of nutrition taught to me.  Yet here I 
was in the critical care unit where people -- where people's lives were at stake.  I had to 
keep them alive with food.  And I was the most clueless person of all.  I went back to 
school. 
 
18:55:45  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  And welcome to our team arguing for the motion.

Our team arguing against the motion that obesity is the government's business includes 
Paul Campos.  He is a modern-day version of the Renaissance man.  He is a Shakespeare 
scholar, a law professor.  He's at the University of Colorado as well as a practicing 
attorney in certain times.  But you're here because of a book you wrote called, "The 
Obesity Myth" in the mid-2000s, which was motivated, you've said before, by an 
interesting confluence of events, the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the use of the word 
zaftig in the public culture to describe her, all of which led you into a new field.  How? 
 
Paul Campos: 
Yeah, I was a -- sounds improbable, but I was a -- I was doing a conference on the 
Clinton impeachment when it was taking place, and a speaker dropped out on me, and I 
had to fill in the gap in the program.  And so I was looking at the media coverage of the 
Clinton impeachment to see if there was something interesting to say about it.   
 
18:56:45 
 
And I did a lexis search, and I found that there were more than 100 news stories that 
used the phrase "Monica Lewinsky" and the word "zaftig."  And I was very struck by 
that, because, of course, as I have discovered in talking about this over the years, the 
vast majority of Americans don't know what zaftig means.  This audience probably has a 
relatively high percentage of people who know what that word means. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But most Americans don't.  And yet Monica Lewinsky was being identified as both fat 
and Jewish, which I thought was kind of interesting by the use of that word.  And so I 
started looking at the weight that -- the role that weight obsessionalism played in the 
Clinton impeachment.  And here we are today. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  And your -- your teammate, John Stossel, John Stossel, well known as a 
journalist, a gadfly, a libertarian, a contrarian and omnivore, I presume. 
 
John Stossel: 
A what?  Yes, yes. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Omna. 
 
John Donvan:

That might have been too personal.  Relevant to this debate, John, you have likened 
those who would want to regulate the diet of Americans to the prohibitionists of the 
early 20th century, the moral being what? 
 
18:57:52  
 
John Stossel: 
That they mean well, but that they do more harm than good. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
John Stossel: 
And it reminds me of what Mencken said, that they have the haunting fear that 
someone somewhere may be happy. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing against the motion. 
 
[applause] 
 
So our motion is obesity is the government's business, and this is a debate.  It's a 
contest. At the end, there will be a winner and a loser.  And you, our live audience here 
at the Skirball Center, will choose the winner.  By the time the evening has ended, we 
will have asked you to vote twice; once before the debate and once again at the end.  
And the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner.  So 
let's go to the preliminary vote.  If you go to the keypad at your seat, our motion is, 
"Obesity is the government's business."  If you agree with the motion, push number 1.  
And if you disagree, push number 2.   
 
18:58:48 
 
And if you're undecided, push number 3.  Ignore the other keys.  And if you push the 
wrong button, just correct yourself, and the system will lock you in.  And what we're 
going to do is we're going to hold the result that we just registered to the end of the 
debate.  We'll release the two numbers together, the starting number and then the 
concluding number.  And as I said, we go in three rounds.  So onto round one.  Our 
motion is "Obesity if the government's business."  In round 1, the speakers speak 
uninterrupted for seven minutes each.  And speaking first for the motion, "Obesity if the 
Government's Business," I'd like to introduce the 16th surgeon general of the United 
States.  He has also served as assistant secretary of health and as director of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. David Satcher.

[applause] 
 
18:59:44  
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Thank you.  Well, we contend that obesity is definitely the government's business.  My 
favorite story I think about policymakers is a story about a man who was traveling across 
the country in a hot air balloon, and at a certain point he realized that he was lost, he 
had no idea where he was, so he decided that he would lower the balloons and see if he 
could see some recognizable landmarks.  So he lowered the balloon, couldn't see 
anything that he recognized, no Golden Gate bridge, no Washington Monument, so he 
had no idea where he was.  So he kept lowering the balloon, and when he got to about 
30 feet above ground he saw a man working in the field.  So he yelled out, "Where am 
I?" and the man stopped digging in the field, and he said, "Well, you're in a hot air 
balloon about 30 feet above ground." 
 
[laughter] 
 
19:00:46 
 
Well, the man in the balloon said, "You sound like a scientist.  Do you work in science?" 
And the man on the ground said, "My goodness, I am a scientist.  But how in the world 
did you know that?"  Said, "Well, I knew that because what you told me is technically 
correct but it is of absolutely no use to me right now." 
 
[laughter] 
 
Well, not to be outdone, the man on the ground said, "Well, you sound like one of those 
policymakers from Washington or somewhere."  And the man in the balloon said, "I am.  
I'm an outstanding policymaker.  I'm a leader.  But how did you know that?"  And the 
man on the ground said, "I knew that because you're in the same position you were 
when we met, you don't know where you are, you don't know where you're going, and 
now you're blaming me."  
 
[laughter] 
 
Well, let me say that I spent nine years in government, five as director of the CDC, and 
as you've heard, four as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health, and I have to 
tell you, I would trade nothing for those nine years.   
 
19:01:52

They were rich years.  The people with whom I worked were special.  So I am very 
excited about the role of government in dealing with a problem like obesity.  Let me just 
say a few of the things I was involved in.  In 1996, while director of CDC, we released a 
very interesting report on physical activity.  It was actually released as a surgeon 
general's report, and basically what we showed in that report on physical activity was 
that there was a dramatic decline in physical activity among the American people, 
including schools no longer requiring physical education, K through 12.  And so we 
expressed a lot of concerns about the sedentary lifestyles of American people and the 
implications of that.   
 
19:02:45 
 
In 1999, I represented the United States at a world conference on health promotion and 
disease prevention.  And at that conference for the first time I released the surgeon 
general's Prescription  [to the American People], which I'm sure many of you are familiar 
with, but among the things on that prescription was the recommendation for regular 
physical activity, at least 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week, but also a 
recommendation that the American people consume at least five servings of fruits and 
vegetables per day.  There were other things on the prescription, even one having to do 
with mental health and the need to have some planned strategy for dealing with stress.  
We didn't really understand at that time the relationship between things like physical 
activity and depression, the fact that physical activity is a major intervention for 
reducing depression.  Then in 2001, as surgeon general and assistant secretary for 
health, I released the surgeon general's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Overweight 
and Obesity.   
 
19:03:52 
 
That report, among other things, pointed out that between 1980 and the year 2000 
there had been a tripling of overweight and obesity among children in this country and a 
doubling among adults.  So we did sound the alarm, and even though I was former 
director of the CDC and we are very selective at what we call "epidemics," usually 
reserved for infectious diseases, we declared that overweight and obesity was an 
epidemic in this country.  We didn't realize at that time that the same thing was 
beginning to happen all over the world.  In that report of the surgeon general on 
overweight and obesity, we especially expressed concern about the changes in the maps 
throughout the country, where you could actually map the increase in overweight and 
obesity in various states, whereas in 1990, 15 percent was almost the high.   
 
19:04:54 
 
By the year 2001, it was 25 to 30 percent of the American people who were obese.  
What we know about overweight and obesity from a population perspective is very 
important, I think, to this debate because what we know is that it has increased 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

dramatically, but also that it is clearly associated with an increase in chronic diseases, 
especially what we call Type II diabetes, or increases in what we call BMI, the way we 
measure body fat, directly related to an increase in Type II diabetes.  And, as you know, 
Type II diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and even renal disease.   
 
19:05:46 
 
So we were concerned about what was happening in this country.  We were concerned 
about the implication of these rising rates of overweight and obesity.  We were also 
concerned about disparities.  We have declared the goal of eliminating disparities in 
health in this country, especially among different racial and ethnic groups.  And what we 
observed, of course, was that this epidemic was disproportionately impacting African 
Americans and American Indians.  So, American Indians also have the highest rate of 
Type II diabetes. And African Americans have the highest mortality rates from Type II 
diabetes.  So we were very concerned about the impact that this was having on 
eliminating disparities in health.  We were also concerned about what was happening in 
children.  I think this was really critical. What we found was that children, by increasing 
overweight and obesity, were now getting what we previously had called adult-onset 
diabetes.   
 
19:06:45 
 
We were seeing it in children.  We were seeing hypertension in children.  Pediatricians 
were expressing great concerns.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Thank you.  I apologize for holding my hand up.  I had hand surgery, and the doctor’s tell 
me hold it up so it doesn’t get inflamed, so I’m not saluting or doing anything weird like 
that. So, Dr. Satcher, I hear you and it’s a problem that people have less physical activity.  
And it would be good if we ate more fruits and vegetables.   
 
19:07:44 
 
And it’s terrible that more people have diabetes, but obesity is the government’s 
business -- that’s a separate issue.  It’s a powerful assumption in that, but behind it is 
the assumption that everything good should be encouraged by government and 
everything bad discouraged.  And at first that sounds like common sense, but everything 
is arguably, to some degree, helpful or harmful.  So, this is a formula for totalitarianism.  
I mean, why is totalitarianism if not the view that everything falls within the purview of 
the state?  Mussolini said that -- “everything within the state, nothing outside.”  Okay, 
that’s over the top.  I’m not saying that government is like a fascist regime, but it’s 
becoming just as invasive.  It spent $3.8 trillion.  It’s going broke.  The philosopher 
Thomas Hobbes started using the term “Leviathan” to refer to a powerful central 
government to which we give up some rights.   
 
19:08:47 
 
And he thought Leviathan was a good thing.  But he assumed that its function was 
protecting us from violence.  He never imagined that Leviathan would plan our meals.  
And the founders of this country never imagined that.  They started the country with 
this.  This is the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.  Together it’s this 
thin.  This is what they thought we needed, and this is what made America prosperous.  
Now, this isn’t everything we should have.  We need pollution control rules.  They didn’t 
think about that. But government has gone much further.  We now have an agriculture 
department that spends $145 billion a year.  Government runs public housing, a war on 
drugs, a welfare state.  It subsidizes farmers and, by doing that, does harm, as Robert 
Rosenkrantz said, making people fatter.  It runs school lunches.  It subsidizes students, 
Indians, researchers, volunteers, small businessmen, rich businessmen, polices the 
world and polices our home and our jobs, our bedrooms.   
 
19:09:52 
 
And now food too?  Well, yes.  But if it weren't already doing all -- trying to do all that 
stuff and doing it badly, it could better do what it's supposed to, protect us from 
criminals and terrorists.  And America wouldn't be going broke.  But look, I have lost 
that argument.  We libertarians have argued that we're in the minority.  I understand 
that.  Most of you disagree. Most of you want more government.  You like the minimum 
wage.  You like the EEOC to protect us against discrimination, Title 9 to protect us 
against gender discrimination, rules against sexual harassment language being used in 
workplaces, the ADA to protect disabled people, laws against prostitution and online 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 -

gambling.  And in the name of health and safety, you support laws requiring motorcycle 
helmets and OSHA to protect the workers, and the CSPC to protect kids from dangerous 
toys, and the whole alphabet soup of agencies that keep growing in Washington.   
 
19:10:50 
 
And my debate partner, Paul, he agrees with that.  He says government ought to 
intervene in these areas.  But even he says not obesity, because obesity is different, and 
government sucks at dealing with it.  But he's the obesity expert.  I'll let him explain 
that.  All I know is that government keeps growing, and that is dangerous to our 
freedom.  Now the president wants to spend another 300 million or so of your dollars to 
pay for his wife's healthy foods financing initiative.  And of course, that's in addition to 
all the stuff we already have, the "let's move" campaign, the task force on childhood 
obesity, the school lunch program, the council on fitness and so on.  What's the result of 
all that stuff?  Since they created it, they spent a lot of your money on it, people are 
fatter than ever.  And that's just what the Feds spend.   
 
19:11:44 
 
The states and localities spend even more.  I mean, New York City now bans bake sales 
in schools.  How much has that helped?  My colleague, Mike Huckabee when he was 
governor of Arkansas, he required every school to measure every kid's body mass index. 
Dr. Satcher mentioned that.  It's a measure based on the height-weight ratio.  It's a 
terrible measure.  I mean, BMI index says that George Clooney and Tom Cruise are 
overweight and Arnold Schwarzenegger is obese.  It just mismeasures people, but it's 
required now in Arkansas.  For every kid, they get a report card that doesn't just give 
their arithmetic score. It tells the parents what their BMI index is.  The result?  Well, I 
don't think it's helped them teach arithmetic because the teachers are distracted.  But 
the kids are just as fat.  It's made no difference in obesity in the schools.  Some states 
say, we ought to have some taxes, taxes on bad food.  And intuitively, this makes sense.  
Let's tax candy and, oh, then they'll eat less candy.  They'll eat more fruits and 
vegetables.   
 
19:12:49 
 
So Illinois did that.  Six percent tax on candy.  But what's the result?  It's just confusing. 
What is candy?  They decide, okay, a Hershey bar is candy, but a Kit Kat bar, that's food 
because it's got flower in it. 
 
[laughter] 
 
So this enriches the bureaucrats and the lawyers, but it doesn't help anybody lose 
weight. In New York City, the government requires calorie counts now to be posted in 
restaurants. And that makes sense.  Information is good.  So NYU did a study of that and 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

found that, yes, adults say they were influenced by the calorie postings.  But then they 
checked the receipts, and they found the people ordered slightly more calories.  
Government can't make us thinner.  Government can't control our personal behavior in 
that way.  And even if it could, we're spending $3.8 trillion going broke.   
 
19:13:45 
 
We couldn't afford to do this even if it worked.  We don't need government to do this.  
There are only two ways to do things in life: voluntary or force.  Government is force.  
We need some force to keep us safe.  But voluntary is better.  And voluntary abounds.  
We have plenty of diet information.  All these diet websites, books on nutrition, TV 
shows like The Biggest Loser, diet gurus are celebrities.  That's enough.  We don't need 
government taking our money, and we don't need government force. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, John Stossel. 
 
[applause] 
 
So here's where we are.  We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence 
Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four debaters arguing out this motion: 
"Obesity is the government's business."  You have heard the first two debaters.  And 
now to introduce our third.  To debate in support of the motion that "Obesity is the 
government's business," here is WebMD's chief lifestyle correspondent, a professor of 
medicine at the University of Maryland and former Pew Foundation scholar in nutrition 
and metabolism, Dr. Pamela Peeke. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:14:52  
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Obesity is the government's business.  You hear from the opposing side that we're 
looking at a nanny state or food policing.   Au contraire, that's not what we're looking 
for at all. Voluntary?  We give you voluntary.  That's what we're looking for.  I wear 
many hats.  I'm a physician first, and I hail from the front trenches, face to face with my 
patients and as chief lifestyle expert for WebMD's 90 million members, click to click with 
my cyber folks.   This is where I practice high-tech touch.  I set up a discussion group 
asking, is obesity the government's business?  It lit up like Kyoto at nighttime.  It was 
fabulous.  The bottom line was, yes, obesity is the government's business for leadership, 
education, protection, options, opportunities, infrastructure.   
 
19:15:56 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

No sidewalk, no walk.  No park, no play.  No bike path, lots of accidents.  Bottom line, 
what they said was, "No blame, no shame.  No tax, no bans."  They drew a line in the 
sand.  And Dr. Satcher and I agree with that.  Obesity is the government's business. 
 
I'm going to flip now to my public health hat.  Government cannot solve the obesity 
problem alone.  A problem as large as obesity, pun fully intended, requires all sectors of 
society to bring our thinking to the table.  So I argue for government private sector 
partnerships. Shouldn't be just the government at all.  When we initiate a voluntary 
campaign or an effort, we want to be able to offer people options and opportunities 
because if there is no choice, there can be no moderation.

We're in New York City.  I love this place.  And although you just heard that some of 
what you're doing isn't working so well, I say, forget all that.  You have programs here, 
for instance, Mayor Bloomberg has joined with 500 other mayors with the "let's move 
cities and town" campaign to be able to work, drill down into the neighborhoods.  What 
we can do to be able to improve physical activity as well as nutrition.  In addition, the 
"fresh" program, food retailed expansion to support health programs.  Say that three 
times.  The food retail expansion to support health program has set up 14 supermarkets 
in food deserts.  This was a private-public collaboration, a partnership that worked.  We 
now have fresh produce out there.  And that's really important.   
 
19:17:46 
 
Of course, we have so many other measures that have taken place.  Good grief, we have 
play streets.  We've taken quiet streets and turned them into play yards because we 
have nothing else out there.  We're using what we can.  We're doing what we can.  At 
the national level, obviously we're looking at prevention now.  The national prevention 
and health promotion strategy to stop disease before it starts.  Million hearts campaign.  
Let's Move actually celebrates its second anniversary this month alone.  And it's been 
reaching out to everyone from REI for outdoor, you know, to a beverage industry for 
clear on calories so you can begin to understand what's going on in those labels.  Is it 
perfect?  Absolutely not.  Is it voluntary, and does it touch people's lives?  Hell yeah.  I'm 
on the board of America on the Move, and we're moving.  We have corporate sponsors.  
We do private, public sponsorships all year long.  We do this in neighborhoods, in states 
all across this country.  We touch people.   
 
19:18:44 
 
Exercise is Medicine, I am their national spokesperson, a collaboration of the American 
Medical Association as well as the American College of Sports Medicine.

And here we see again trying to show people that there are simple, small steps, literally, 
that you can take to be able to help yourself, voluntary, nothing stuffed up your nose.  
We're not going to the tax and ban place.  We're not food policing.  We're reaching out 
asking people to hold our hand and say, come on.  We can do this together.  Is it sloppy?  
Yeah. Are we perfect?  No.  We're about as perfect as the people who create them and 
implement them.  We're human.  We're getting there. 
 
I'm going to switch over to my last hat for my seven minutes as a researcher.  Guess 
what? The National Institutes of Health is public funding.  $32 billion to save your lives, 
to do the work we do.   
 
19:19:47 
 
It's interesting, when I began my work there as a senior scientist, I went to the clinical 
director's office, and above the office there was a sign that said, "In God we trust," and 
there was a little sign below it that said, "Everyone else must show data."  
 
[laughter] 
 
Fairly straightforward.  We wanted to see some good data here.  And so in our 
laboratory we showed the connection between chronic stress for instance and the 
buildup of that toxic fat deep inside your belly which increases your risk for heart 
disease and diabetes.  We showed for instance that it's not about ELMM, "Eat less, 
move more."  That's so important, however, so much bigger.  We forgot the mind.  
What about stress?  New research has just been published showing that children who 
are stressed, and you know what that's about, in their childhood, at home, at school, eat 
more, and that's that stress-fat connection that we talk about so often.  What are we 
doing about that?   
 
19:20:44 
 
We have a new science called, "epigenetics," we're trying to look at how we can literally 
change gene expression, how we turn on and off genes, by simply doing easy things like 
if I eat an apple every day on a regular basis I get that gene expression and therefore I'm 
able to what?  Have an increased or decreased vulnerability toward obesity.  Or I could 
just do what so many people do, that nocturnal ménage à trois every night, you know 
what I'm talking about, you, Ben, and Jerry.  
 
[laughter] 
 
All together in bed watching the tube, hanging out, doing it.  Doesn't work, all right?  
What's that gene expression looking like?  All right.  So here we're looking at something 
that's a brand new phenomenon, something we love to call "secondhand obesity."  
What we're looking at is virally, families, what's going on with them?  How are we 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 -

touching kids?  It's so much bigger than demonizing sugar.  It's so much bigger, so much 
bigger than saying the government's just too fat.   
 
19:21:45 
 
What we're saying is, putting our hand out, we're trying to say, "Educate, bigger brain, 
better choices, obesity is the government's business." 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Pamela Peeke.  And that is our motion, "Obesity is the government's 
business." And now here, our final debater against the motion, Paul Campos.  He is 
professor of law at the University of Colorado in Boulder, and author of "The Obesity 
Myth: Why America's Obsession with Weight is Hazardous to Your Health." 
 
Paul Campos: 
Thank you.  I think that the fundamental difficulty here is that, despite the great 
courtesy of the organizers of this debate to invite me, I'd like to start by pointing out 
that this debate is framed in completely the wrong way.  To have a motion that says, 
"Obesity is the government's business," essentially begs the question because using the 
term "obesity" frames the debate as one which is about the supposedly pathological 
state of people who have a body mass index of about 30 if they're obese or above 25 if 
they're overweight.   
 
19:22:54 
 
And that in itself essentially tells us that we ought to think about those states as being 
per se bad and in fact a diseased or a quasi-diseased state.  Imagine if this debate were 
framed as, "Eliminating body diversity is the government's business."  I think that would 
sound a lot different, but in point of fact there is really -- there is no practical distinction 
between those two motions.  The assumptions at work here are that a narrow range of 
body weight is normal for human beings and that outside that range a variation is the 
product of poor lifestyle.  Furthermore, it's assumed in the framing of this issue that by 
reforming poor lifestyle either voluntarily or quasi coercively, you can eliminate 
abnormal body weight.  This is all wrong.   
 
19:23:46 
 
There's nothing normal about normal body weight.  It's not normal statistically.  It's not 
normal epidemiologically.  The overweight category of BMI 25 to 29.9 does not, in fact, 
feature increased overall health risk, so there isn't even a correlation there between 
increased health risk and the pathologizing of that body state.  The vast majority of 
people, and I'm going to say this about 27 times tonight, cannot intentionally modify 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

their body mass in a long term fashion successfully.  There is no better established 
proposition empirically in all of medicine than that.  In other words, people, as you all 
know -- well, I shouldn't say "all of you," but many of you know from personal 
experience -- find it extraordinarily difficult to change their body weight in a significant 
long term way voluntarily.  Government intervention in this area, and my partner, John 
Stossel is quite correct in saying that.   
 
19:24:47 
 
In comparison to him, I am almost a Stalinist in my enthusiasm for government 
intervention, although I think he did overstate a couple of my positions.  I won’t get into 
those because that’s beside the point.  But in fact, even though I am generally 
enthusiastic about various forms of government regulation that fill him with dread, I am 
in fact utterly opposed to government regulation in this area because I think 
government -- the same as -- obesity as government’s business is almost a kind of dream 
scenario for a Libertarian.  Because a Libertarian could not come up with a better 
example of government dysfunction than of the notion that we’re supposed to make 
people thinner, mainly because -- well, for a bunch of reasons, which I want to go 
through quickly right now and then come back to later.   
 
19:25:37 
 
Here I want to emphasize first of all that we do not know an enormous number of things 
that we would have to know if we were going to have a rational policy that was based 
on the notion that we were going to make everybody have a BMI between 18.5 and 
24.9, the so-called normal range, which for an average height woman would be 
between 108 and 144 pounds, outside of that supposedly pathological.  Here’s what we 
don’t know.  We don’t know how to produce significant long-term weight loss.  We just 
don’t.  We don’t know if such weight loss would be beneficial.  This hypothesis has not 
been tested for the very good reason that since we don’t know how to produce it, we 
can’t test the hypothesis.  We don’t know to what extent, if at all, the generally weak 
associations between obesity and increased health risk are products of a causal 
relationship as opposed to markers for other things like, for example, dieting, weight 
cycling, diet drug use, eating disorders, stress, stigma, and lower socioeconomic status.  
We don’t know why weight went up among Americans in the 1980s and ‘90s.  We don’t 
know why it was stable in the 1960s and ‘70s. We don’t know why it has plateaued over 
the course of the last 10 years.   
 
19:26:47 
 
We don’t in fact know whether people are more sedentary today than they were 40 
years ago.  We just don’t have the data on that.  We just have a few very indirect 
markers for that, such as the amount of mandatory gym periods in school, but we don’t 
have any direct measurement of how active people were 40 years ago.  We don’t know 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

whether people consume more calories today than they did 40 years ago.  Again, the 
data is not available. People often -- you know, when that’s pointed out to them rather 
rudely by someone like me, the reaction of public health officials tends to be something 
like, “Well, it’s just common sense,” right.  But see, common sense is what you invoke 
when you don’t have data, right. 
 
[laughter] 
 
That’s why we have these academic institutions, right, so that we don’t just rely on 
common sense.  We actually try to have some evidence for our propositions.  Here’s 
what we do know.  We do know that public health interventions designed to produce 
weight loss do not produce weight loss.  This hypothesis has been tested.   
 
19:27:44 
 
It’s been tested in situations where we have had intense public health intermediations 
that are much more intense than those that we could produce on a population-wide 
scale.  And those interventions do not produce weight loss, either in adults or children.  
We do know that labeling bodies as diseased is stigmatizing, and we know that stigma is 
very bad for health, as are stress, weight cycling, and eating disorders, which are other 
things that are produced by this kind of labeling.  We do know that risk factors that are 
associated with obesity, like, for instance, hypertension, can be addressed cheaply and 
successfully through inexpensive drugs that work quite well and increased physical 
activity, which is beneficial for people of all shapes and sizes whether in fact it produces 
any weight loss, which it usually doesn’t.  Finally, what I really would want to emphasize 
here above all is that healthy lifestyles don’t eliminate body diversity, which is found 
among people with a wide variety of body types, many of whom fall outside the phony, 
so-called normal range.  
 
19:28:47 
 
And so, what I would advocate more than anything else is that we ought to focus on a 
harm reduction, not weight reduction.  We’ve already had some indications tonight of 
the notion that we don’t want to stress people.  Here’s a suggestion.  Stop telling them 
that their bodies are pathological because that’s very stressful. 
 
[applause] 
 
That’s not good for people.  And if you say that you don’t want to stigmatize obese 
people but you just want to stigmatize obesity, I would suggest that that is a protocol 
that’s not going to be successful.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Paul Campos.

[applause] 
 
And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Square U.S. debate.  And remember, 
we had you vote in the beginning, and we’re going to ask you to vote again at the end.  
And the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner.  
Now, onto round two where the debaters will address each other directly and take 
questions from me and from you in the audience and from Slate readers who have 
submitted questions and from people watching on ForaTV, we have two teams of two 
here arguing out this motion: "Obesity is the government's business."   
 
19:29:55 
 
On one side, arguing in support of this motion, David Satcher and Pamela Peeke.  They 
are arguing that we have a national emergency underway, a record of weight gain 
among Americans that threatens to bankrupt the health care system and to break the 
health of those who are obese, but they also offer hope in the role of government as -- 
in its ability to offer leadership and protection and infrastructure in support of the 
actions of those individuals who do want to lose weight.  The side arguing against 
includes John Stossel and Paul Campos.  They are arguing in a two-pronged attack.  One 
is, they're basically saying the research is wrong that says that obesity is killing us.  And 
the research is wrong that suggests that we even know how to lose weight.  They're also 
saying basically that whenever Uncle Sam attempts to govern the health of an 
individual, Uncle Sam always gets it wrong.   
 
19:30:48 
 
So there's a lot to talk about there and a lot to explore.  And I want to go first to the side 
arguing in support of the motion.  What your opponents have left hanging out there 
repeatedly is the notion that government's track record already is terrible, that over the 
last 20 years, 30 years, as government programs have been put into place, we've just 
gotten heavier.  So take that on.  What -- what is the evidence that in fact government 
can have an impact on obesity of individuals?  David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Well, I think the evidence is related to several things.  First, we had a very interesting 
study funded by NIH in the late '90s, early part of this 2000.   
 
19:31:38 
 
And basically showed that if we could get people to be physically active and to change 
their diet, even if they lost only five to 15 percent of their weight, we could dramatically 
decrease the risk for diabetes, in fact almost 60 percent reduction among African-
Americans and American Indians in the onset of Type II diabetes, by getting people to 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

change their lifestyles and to be more physically active and to consume diets with less 
saturated fats and sugars.  So I think we do know, from that study, that it's possible to 
help people change lifestyles.  And I did say help because Pamela is correct, there are a 
lot of people in this country who do not have access to healthy lifestyles.  And it is in fact 
a responsibility of government to make sure that everybody has the opportunity, 
everybody has access to the opportunity for healthy lifestyles. 
 
John Donvan: 
But the point of the question goes not just to the theory behind it, but the track record 
of the government. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
The track record that I mentioned was the one dealing with African-Americans and 
American Indians in terms of reducing -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
-- the risk for diabetes mellitus. 
 
19:32:49  
 
John Donvan: 
Let me go to the other side.  Paul Campos, would you like to respond? 
 
Paul Campos: 
Yes.  In fact in that study -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul, can you move just a touch closer to your mic? 
 
Paul Campos: 
Yes, right.  And it's a study that Dr. Satcher was citing there, there was an average of 2.3 
kilograms of weight loss, which is about four pounds.  The difficulty with citations to the 
notion that a small amount of weight loss is going to greatly reduce the risk of Type II 
diabetes is that a couple things, one, you can't -- you cannot disentangle the amount of 
weight loss that is produced, which is generally quite small, from the beneficial effect of 
the lifestyle intervention.  The way that you would want to test that, to say, well, let's 
look at the people who've lost weight and compare them to the people who didn't lose 
weight if they all engage in the same lifestyle intervention.  Is there a dose response that 
is related to the weight loss?  And the answer is no, there isn't.  In those studies, the 
people who engaged in the same lifestyle changes but didn't lose weight had the same 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

reduction, on average, in Type II diabetes risk as people who engaged in the lifestyle 
changes and did in fact lose some weight.   
 
19:33:52 
 
So to me, that's really compelling evidence for the notion that focusing on weight in that 
context doesn't make any sense.  I'm all for focusing on, you know, lifestyle changes.  I 
think it's good to encourage people to be physically active.  But there's a lot of evidence 
that physical activity in and of itself is beneficial.  But what there's not evidence of is 
that either physical activity changes are going to produce significant long-term weight 
loss.  Again, they don't in the vast majority of people, or secondly, that the weight loss is 
necessary for the purposes of getting the benefits of the increase in the -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Paul Campos: 
-- in the activity levels. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to go to Pamela Peeke.  You're on the side with the two doctors.  Your opponents 
are basically saying -- they're blowing up conventional wisdom here -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Mm-hmm. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- by saying this -- you're not quite saying it, but you're suggesting, Paul, that there's not 
a whole lot of point in reducing your calories and exercising more if your goal is to lose 
weight.   
 
19:34:44 
 
And that just flies in the face of everything that even you stand for in your work, 
Pamela.  So take that on. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
I will be more than happy to take that on.  Apparently Paul is not aware of the national 
weight control registry.  This is an ongoing study, almost 20 years old, which has been 
sponsored by the University of Colorado as well as Brown University, my colleagues, Dr. 
James Hill and Rena Wing.  The cohort right now is over 10,000 people, including people 
who have bariatric surgery as well.  And these people are known as the successful 
losers. And actually, Paul, you actually are too, because of your own weight loss as you 
noted in your book.  You qualify because you had to have dropped at least 30 pounds 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

and kept it off for at least a year.  And the grand majority of these people have kept off 
approximately 60 pounds for almost six years or longer.  And this is on the average in a 
very large cohort.  So are these mutants?   
 
19:35:45 
 
Freaks?  What are they?  These people have determined that they will keep this weight 
off by utilizing very simple things.  And this has been published in extensive literature.  
One of the most interesting things we found was that the number one predictor for 
being able to keep weight off and do this well is to have a healthy breakfast every 
morning.  They are physically active.  Are they part of the Olympic camp?  No.  They 
basically get out.  And the number one favorite thing to do is walk.  And in most of the 
government interventions, all we're asking people to do is not drop weight so much.  
That's not where we're going.  Losing weight, I'm a physician.  People lose weight and do 
really stupid things to lose weight.  That's not where we're going. 
 
John Donvan: 
So you're talking -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
We're going to health. 
 
John Donvan: 
You're talking -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
We're going to health, and we're going to fitness. 
 
John Donvan: 
Pamela. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
And that's what we saw in this study. 
 
John Donvan: 
So you're emphasizing information, encouragement and education. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Absolutely. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to ask John Stossel, what's wrong with the government through schools 
emphasizing education information and encouragement? 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

19:36:47  
 
John Stossel: 
Because Pamela said that's all voluntary and talked about public-private partnerships 
being voluntary.  But government isn't voluntary.  It said we have a voluntary tax 
system.  But try not paying your taxes and see if it's voluntary.  Men with guns will come 
and make you pay for the dumb programs that they keep creating that don't work and 
that Paul says make people miserable. 
 
[laughter] 
 
And keep growing. 
 
John Donvan: 
But John, what would be the harm of -- of spending money in a school to put this on the 
curriculum and keep it on the curriculum? 
 
John Stossel: 
Because the schools can barely teach reading, writing and arithmetic. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Well, I think a couple of things.  The goal of these programs is to help children develop 
lifetime habits of physical activity and good nutrition.   
 
19:37:42 
 
We also know, by the way, that children who develop good eating habits and regular 
physical activity do better academically.  They perform better on standardized exams in 
math and reading.  They are more disciplined in school.  So the benefits of healthy 
lifestyles go far beyond losing weight. Now, Paul quoted the statistics about weight loss 
versus decrease in diabetes.  The goal is to decrease fat.  And sometimes you can 
decrease fat and increase muscle and not lose weight.  But you still reduce the risk of 
diabetes.  I think you know that as a runner. 
 
John Stossel: 
So let them learn that from Pamela's TV show and from Richard Simmons.  We don't 
need government. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Excuse -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Here's the problem. 
 
John Donvan: 
Pamela Peeke. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Yeah, that's nice for people who do have cable TV.  Unfortunately, many people don't 
have Discovery Channel. 
 
[applause] 
 
So for those poor people out there who have no access, what are you going to do?  You 
just assume they're going to catch it on the tube.  Oh, no.  You're not supposed to be 
watching TV because if you watch TV too long, you get this big.   
 
19:38:44 
 
So, I mean, you're going round and round.  Why not just sit there?  Why not do what 
Alice Waters did in Berkeley, the Martin Luther King middle school?  She built a garden.  
She had the kids grow stuff. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Paul Campos. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Kids who grow and eat it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul Campos.  Again, just -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Paul Campos: 
Well, I just -- I love Alice Waters' cooking, I'll tell you.  I think it's awesome.  But I think 
her social policy is rather questionable because she wants everybody to be like they're 
an upper class white woman in Berkeley.  And that's just not going to happen, right, for 
all kinds of reasons.  Now, what I'm going to emphasize here is that the government's 
theory seems to be something along the lines of, people are fat because they have not 
been given the information that it is more desirable in this culture to be thin rather than 
to be fat.  I don't think that's correct.  I think this information is -- is not exactly a state 
secret.  It's been widely disseminated. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Well, let's be clear, though. 
 
John Donvan: 
David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
It's not the information.  It's the opportunity to act on it. 
 
19:39:46 
 
I think what Pamela described in terms of in the inner cities of the country—you don't 
have sidewalks, you don't have safe places to be physically active, you don't have access 
to grocery stores, so what you're talking about is the opportunity -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
That's absolutely right. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
-- to leave -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Tell me the government's role in creating those opportunities.  Are you literally talking 
about building sidewalks, [unintelligible] -- 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Yeah, in some -- 
 
John Donvan: 
The government -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Look at what Louisville did.  It changed the zoning laws so that within so much area you 
had to have grocery stores and you had to have parks and playgrounds, so the 
government can, in fact, produce the opportunities for people to have access. 
 
John Donvan: 
Did people lose weight in Louisville when that happened? 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Well, I think it's too soon to say they lost weight but they clearly increased healthy 
lifestyle, but, believe me, the fixation on weight is not ours.  
 
Paul Campos: 
Oh, really? 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
The fixation here is on healthy lifestyles. 
 
Paul Campos: 
What was your report called, Dr. Satcher, your 2001 report?  Was it a report on healthy 
lifestyles? 
 
19:40:43  
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
No, the first ever surgeon general's report was on smoking and health and it was on 
cancer, but that wasn't the focus.  The focus was on getting people to stop smoking. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Absolutely. 
 
Paul Campos: 
So are you in favor of getting people to stop eating? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Getting people to stop -- getting people to eat -- to engage in healthy lifestyles. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Well, I'm all for engaging in healthy lifestyles, but I'd like to point out that -- 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
That's the role of government. 
 
Paul Campos: 
-- one of the most interesting things about this debate is that if you had a time capsule, 
everything that's being said by the advocates of the government's position here was 
said almost literally word for word in the 1950s.  Remember -- some of you may 
remember -- President John Kennedy -- I don't remember it actually, but I've read about 
it -- initiative for the president's council on physical fitness, right? 
 
John Stossel:

I remember that. 
 
Paul Campos: 
John remembers it, right? 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
I remember that, you had to throw a softball 100 yards and do pushups -- 
 
Paul Campos: 
That's right, all that kind of thing, [unintelligible], you know, that we're all 
for[unintelligible], and, you know, for being healthy in that way.  John Kennedy was 
actually a wreck physically but they hid that quite successfully at the time because -- but 
anyways, that's another story.  
 
19:41:47 
 
The thing is, it's really striking, if you looked at the literature, the government officials 
were saying in the 1950s the same thing they're saying today, they're saying, 
"Americans are getting horribly fat, and it's going to cause this huge health crisis, and if 
we don't do something about it, the Russians are going to just come in and push us over 
and takeover --" 
 
[laughter] 
 
"-- and it's, you know, the terrorists within," and all that stuff, and nothing that was ever 
predicted took place.  But this is one area I have found in terms of government policy 
and social hysteria and moral panic where data simply doesn't move anything because 
people have such a fixation with the desirability of weight loss that you can talk all you 
want about how we ought to have healthier lifestyles, but what people really want to do 
is make people thin. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
No, we don't want to make people thin. 
 
John Donvan: 
[unintelligible] Pamela for just one second. 
 
Pamela Peeke:

We don't want to make people thin.  And I don't know where this came from.  
Apparently there's a fantasy land going on over there. 
 
[laughter] 
 
"Thin" is a four-letter word, okay?  I don't know what it means.   
 
19:42:46 
 
All we care about is healthy and fit.  Come on.  Let's get real here for a minute.  Fifty 
years ago, if you were 10 or 15 pounds overweight it was a crisis, you know, you 
couldn't get out of your size four, whatever.  Today I'm a physician and I don't make fun 
of this stuff.  I'm a compassionate physician because I have people sitting in front of me 
and they're in pain.  And do you know what?  They don't have 15 to 20 pounds to drop.  
They have 100 and 150.  It's changed.  It's changed from 1950.  And I'll tell you what, 
they'll never get within spitting distance of an ideal body weight, so you know what I do 
today?  I've changed the game.  I think it's head south, just start moving down, five 
percent, 10 percent, pick up healthy lifestyles, small steps here.  That's all you need to 
do. 
 
John Donvan: 
But, Pamela, what does that have to do -- what does that have to do with the 
government's being -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
It has everything to do with the government -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Make the case. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
-- because they don't have resources.  Where are the play yards?  Where are the parks?  
Where are the bike paths? 
 
19:43:46  
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Let me take that to John Stossel.  Let me just take that to John Stossel.  
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
I just want to say, though -- 
 
John Donvan: 
We haven't heard from him.  All right, go ahead, very quickly.

Dr. David Satcher: 
It would be very interesting to find these studies that Paul is quoting saying that obesity 
was a major problem in the '50s.  There's no such study.  We looked at every -- 
 
Paul Campos: 
Forty percent of the American population was, quote, unquote, "overweight," in 1958, 
40 percent, so apparently if there's been an epidemic, we've had an epidemic for a long 
time. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
But overweight -- I want to be clear about "overweight," because I know you've written, 
saying that people who are overweight are healthier.  Many people who are overweight 
are athletes who are muscular or people who work out, so we admit it in our books, we 
acknowledge that the BMI is not reliable in people who are muscular, who are athletes, 
and who work out.  So I think that's a distortion. 
 
John Donvan: 
John Stossel, I've been asking the other side for specifics on what the government can 
do. They're talking about building parks, playgrounds, sidewalks, to give people the 
chance to get physically fit, particularly in communities where we know those things are 
at a deficit. Take that on. 
 
19:44:45  
 
John Stossel: 
My understanding is that there are just as many or more parks, playgrounds and 
sidewalks as there have ever been.  People can exercise if they wanted to.  And John, 
you talked about they’re responding to this national emergency.  That’s the justification 
for government, and I think you’re right.  And that always is.  The crisis is the friend of 
the state.  But there -- the specialists always have emergencies.  It’s terrorism or global 
warming or Y2K. Remember, the planes were all going to crash, and the killer bees were 
coming up from Mexico, were going to sting us all to death, and Bird Flu and plastic 
bottles.  It’s endless.  It all requires government to intervene, to raise your taxes and to 
limit your freedom. 
 
John Donvan: 
Pamela Peeke.  John says there’s plenty of sidewalks and parks. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
John.  John, where the hell do you live?

Pamela Peeke: 
Honey, listen, get out of New York -- get out of New York and live, right.  Go out to the 
hinterland.  Go out to places where people don’t have these -- 
 
John Stossel: 
The hinterland is one big park. 
 
[laughter] 
 
19:45:49  
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Very seriously, John.  I mean, really, what we’re looking at is the ability to be able to give 
people options.  We keep telling people to go out and do whatever.  Eat less, move 
more. You give them food deserts.  You don’t give them anywhere to move that’s safe.  
And then what do you have?  Where is that obesity?  Do I see a lot of obesity out here?  
I don’t think so.  Again, go to the hinterland.  John, keep looking.  It’s up there 
somewhere. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
You don’t have to go to the hinterland.  There are many areas in this city and 
surrounding cities where it’s not safe to get out and walk in the street.  It’s not safe.  
There’s no safe place. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Stossel: 
It’s safer than it used to be.  Crime is down. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
I’m sorry. 
 
John Stossel: 
It’s safer than it used to be.  Crime is down.  And obesity is up. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
And it’s down in great part because of the same leadership that’s now saying that we’ve 
got to change the way we direct food to people.

I want to move a little -- 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
We’ve got to intervene to make sure that people know what they’re eating. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to move to another part of the argument that Paul Campos has put out there, 
where he’s basically challenging the scientific underpinnings of the argument that 
you’re making.  I mean, Dr. Satcher, you said that you’ve talked about -- you’ve 
discussed the association between obesity and diabetes.  You didn’t -- causation -- you 
said an association.  But Paul Campos, you’re saying that even that association doesn’t 
exist. 
 
Paul Campos: 
No, the association exists, but the relationship is complex, right.  I mean, the notion -- 
do we know that diabetes causes obesity?  How do we know that obesity doesn’t cause 
diabetes? 
 
John Donvan: 
Do we know? 
 
Paul Campos: 
Right, we -- in other words -- 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
We don’t know -- we don’t know the cause of breast cancer.  That doesn’t mean we 
don’t screen for it.  We do know the association. 
 
[applause] 
 
Paul Campos: 
Well, yeah, but David, I don’t think -- 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
In public health, we deal with associations. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Do you want to just perform mastectomies on women who don’t have breast cancer so 
they can avoid getting breast cancer?

The connection is --

Okay, Paul, Paul. 
 
John Donvan: 
Pamela Peeke. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah.  In our laboratory, in the laboratories of many 
of our esteemed colleagues around the country, we’ve made it very clear that excessive 
visceral adiposity, a lot of fat deep inside your belly, is highly associated with a pro-
inflammatory state, which increases the risk of diabetes, coronary vascular disease and 
cancer, period.  I have that much literature to back up.  
 
Paul Campos: 
Yes, that’s right. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
And you know what?  You can get rid of visceral body fat -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul, let her finish. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
In addition, Paul, the information that you presented showing that overweight is okay 
by me is actually wrong.  And that has been refuted by at least two pooled meta-
analyses publishes in Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine by my colleague, 
Dr. Walter Willett from Harvard and by leading epidemiologists around this country 
basically refuting your -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, let’s -- great.  Paul, go ahead. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Yeah, well, first of all, visceral body fat can be very effectively dealt with through 
changes in activity levels.  It’s not going to --

19:48:50  
 
John Donvan: 
But are you conceding that there’s a relationship between visceral body fat and -- 
 
Paul Campos: 
There is a correlation between visceral body fat and increased health risks.  That’s quite 
true, but the notion -- look, again, I want to emphasize the willingness to talk out of 
both sides of the mouth on this issue is just astonishing to me.  You have people coming 
here and say obesity, obesity, obesity, right.  We have this huge crisis. And then I point 
out this is a bunch of nonsense.  And then it gets flipped around into, “Well, we’re not 
really talking about obesity.  We’re talking about lifestyle.”  This isn’t called, you know, 
“Is lifestyle the government’s business?”  This doesn’t have a picture of a lifestyle on the 
front of it, right. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
David Satcher. 
 
Paul Campos: 
It has a picture of a -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Come on, just wait a moment.  David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Now, let’s be fair.  Obesity is an outcome, in many cases, of unhealthy lifestyles.  It’s not 
that simple.  We differ in terms of metabolism.  There’re some people who can eat a lot 
of calories and not gain a lot of weight.  There are other people who gain weight easily.  
So everybody’s not equal.   
 
19:49:44 
 
We’re not stigmatizing people who are obese.  Read the surgeon general's report, 
clearly says this is not about appearances.  It's about health.  And the way to improve 
health is to change lifestyles. That's what the report says. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I'd like to go to the audience for some questions now.  And reminding you of 
the point I made earlier.  We'd like you to be terse, on point, a question that leads us to 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

the discussion of government involvement with this issue of obesity and to really make 
it a question.  And there's a gentleman right in the middle.  Yep.  I pointed to you.  And if 
you can stand and state your name, and try to follow the rules. 
 
Mel Zolkins: 
My name is Mel Zolkins [spelled phonetically].  First, one sentence statement.  The 
function of our government -- one of the functions is to promote the general welfare, 
unquote.  So now the one sentence question to Mr. Stossel is, what does that mean to 
you? 
 
[applause] 
 
19:50:42  
 
John Donvan: 
Wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Wait.  Stand up.  I -- I'd like you to -- we can get John Stossel going way off on this one. 
And I'd like you to focus that question more to the topic if you can.  And I think you can 
probably do it with four or five words.  So give it another shot. 
 
Mel Zolkins: 
I'll leave that up to you. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
Mel Zolkins: 
You know what I have in mind, obviously. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  But it would be so charming if you said it. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Mel Zolkins: 
You can say it better. 
 
John Donvan: 
John Stossel, the gentleman is asking whether you feel that the government's 
responsibility for the social welfare includes the health of the individual.  Do you -- and 
your opponents have talked about the enormous amount of government money that's 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

spent on funding research that is saving people's lives.  That costs money.  That's taxes.  
Looks like it has a benefit.  Is that the government's business? 
 
John Stossel: 
Well, they mention the NIH and basic research.  And there is a better argument to be 
made that that does promote the general welfare.   
 
19:51:42 
 
But if the general welfare means the obesity police or the lifestyle police, then there is 
no limit to what government can do.  Then they can reach into every crevice of your life.  
They can ban the dinner you're about to have. They can ban fat -- 
 
John Donvan: 
John, really? 
 
John Stossel: 
-- and ice cream. 
 
John Donvan: 
I mean -- I need -- this as a neutral journalist.  I need to know what you're talking about 
when you talk about the -- 
 
John Stossel: 
You used to work at ABC.  You can't be a neutral journalist. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Sorry. 
 
John Donvan: 
I know.  I know, I need to be more fair and balanced, John.  But -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
John, I just want to know, when you're talking about these police telling us what we can 
eat for dinner, where is this -- you know, I know you're talking about a slippery slope.  I 
can see that.  But where -- be more detailed about this fear.  I mean, where do you see 
this happening?  You're talking about in terms of -- the discussion of soda taxes, issues 
like that.  Is that what you're talking about happening? 
 
John Stossel: 
Well, that's part of it.  I mean, Thomas Jefferson said it's the natural progress of things 
for government to grow and liberty to yield.

Government always grows.  It starts with information.  It moves to taxes.  Then it moves 
to limits on what you can consume.  And now that we have Obama care and the 
government says we're going to pay for your health care, then that's an argument to 
say, we have the right to have exercise police come into your home and make you 
improve your lifestyle. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
You start off by quoting -- 
 
John Donvan: 
David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
-- Lincoln, so I'll quote Lincoln who said that it is the role of government to do for people 
what they cannot do for themselves.  And that's what we're talking about here. 
 
John Stossel: 
People can't lose weight for themselves? 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Not if they don't have safe places to be physically active, not if they don't have access to 
fresh fruits and vegetables. 
 
Pamela Peeke:

And I was curious how would you respond to the idea that the government's role is to 
protect the collective rights of the citizens which overarches the protection of every one 
of our individual rights, and that the increase in obesity which represents that bridge 
represents a threat to our society, for example, the increase in rising costs of Medicaid 
which we all have to put a -- which we all have to contribute to. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  So I want to say that John really just answered the first part of your question, I 
think in terms of overall responsibility.  But you're asking about whether -- whether in 
fact we're looking at a cost benefit between obesity on the one hand and the costs of 
treating people who would be ill with the diseases that this side is talking about.  Am I 
right?  So I want to take that to Paul Campos. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Well, couple things.  First of all, if you're concerned about rising medical costs, which 
you would be in favor of if you believe that obesity kills people, then much obesity is 
possible because what drives medical care costs through the roof is an aging population, 
all right?  
 
19:54:47 
 
That's where the health care costs get spent, right?  In an elderly population, supposedly 
obese people are all going to die before they get to be old, right, which is, of course, 
nonsense.  But if you really did believe that, that's what would drive down health care 
costs. Secondly, and I think more fundamentally -- and I just want to repeat this again.  
We cannot make fat people thin, okay?  So even if it was desirable from a social 
perspective to produce a society that did not have a lot of fat people in it, you cannot do 
that in a developed economy, right?  We have a situation in this country where we 
somehow got it into our heads that everybody can be within a certain narrow range of 
body mass if they have a healthy lifestyle.  That's -- there's absolutely no reason for 
believing that that's true or that it's in any way necessary.  So I mean, I'll tell you what, 
you know what really would reduce health care costs more than anything else?  I can do 
a back of the envelope calculation right now.  We can reduce healthcare costs by $1.7 
trillion a year out of the 1.9 trillion that we spend by just having everybody be between 
the ages of 20 and 29. 
 
[laughter] 
 
19:55:45 
 
That would drive health care costs down to the floor, right?  But nobody is suggesting 
that we do that.  And this is the same thing.  It's suggesting that we have a population 
that is going to be completely above --

John Donvan: 
Okay.  Both your opponents want to speak. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
That's a great question -- 
 
John Donvan: 
David -- David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
-- that you raise.  Let me just say that 80 percent of Medicare costs -- and Medicare is 
the most expensive program that government supports in terms of health.  80 percent 
of their costs are due to preventable diseases.  And certainly, half of that is related to 
obesity and Type II diabetes.  There's no question about it.  So it is true that the 
government has a self-interest to try to help people to develop healthy lifestyles.  And 
we're not even talking about obesity.  We're talking about the benefits of healthy 
lifestyles generally.  Less diabetes mellitus, which is a major driver of costs of Medicare 
and other health programs. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Can we quit saying that we're trying to aim for turning fat people into thin people?  This 
is -- just end it now, please. 
 
19:56:48  
 
John Donvan: 
Well, Pamela -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
This is ridiculous. 
 
John Donvan: 
But Pamela -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
We're going for healthy, and we're going for fit.  We don't want life spans.  We want 
health spans.  We want the highest quality of life we can have.  And if you started out at 
250 pounds, and you're a 5'4" woman, and right now you're 180 and a happy camper, 
God bless you.  So long as you're fit and happy.  And we're also forgetting the head in 
this whole thing too.  We're not science fair projects here.  We forgot our heads.  The 
stress factor here, of course we talked about stigma.  No one wants to stigmatize.  I'm a 
physician.  I see this every day.  I feel that pain and that -- and I feel that compassion as I 
try to help someone go south from 250 or whatever.  What we're going for is health --

No, no, no.  I -- I didn't mean that at all that way.  I was going to ask for clarification.  
What are you looking for when you say it's not to get from heavy to thin, and you did 
answer it.  In the third row here, just down front. 
 
19:57:50  
 
Jennifer Sogus: 
Hello.  My name is Jennifer Sogus [spelled phonetically].  I'm an urban planner, and 
public health researcher here in New York City at transportation alternative.  And I come 
from a school of thought that I appreciate Dr. Peeke that you spoke to a play street such 
as one of my signature programs at Transportation Alternative.  I come from a school of 
thought that has proven that when people do not have access to playgrounds and 
sidewalks and bike lanes, that they are less physically active and that they are more 
overweight.  So my question pertains to a particular piece of legislation on the table 
right now around transportation funding which, as written, prohibits federal funding 
from being spent on walking and biking and transit infrastructure.  So my question to all 
of the panelists is, what is the role of government in funding or not funding things that 
encourage or discourage people from being physically active? 
 
[applause] 
 
19:58:49  
 
John Donvan: 
I'd like John Stossel to take it on first. 
 
John Stossel: 
I don't understand what you're talking about.  The highway trust fund is already taken 
from drivers who pay the gas tax.  And something like 20 percent of it is used for things 
like bike paths.  So it's already being spent on these things.  Our government is spending 
$3.8 trillion.  You want them to build grocery stores now?  I mean, government can't 
even count the votes accurately, and you want them to fix lifestyle problems?  This is a 
mistake.

John Donvan: 
Let's go to David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Well, I think we ought to be clear.  You know, we are the government, and it is the role 
of government to create the conditions in which people can be healthy.  That's how we 
define public health.  That's how the Institute of Medicine defines public health.  It is the 
role of public health to create the condition.   
 
19:59:43 
 
It's a collective effort to create the conditions in which people can be healthy.  And 
that's what we're talking about. 
 
John Stossel: 
But aren't there more opportunities to be healthy now than ever before?  Per capita 
income, a bicycle is cheaper than it used to be.  There are more soccer leagues than 
there ever used to be.  There's more awareness of physical activity. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Oh, I'm so sorry, did you forget about the fact that in the grand majority of schools 
across this country physical education is all but eliminated, it's gone? 
 
[applause] 
 
John Stossel: 
Well, let's get rid of government schools -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
And so we have -- 
 
John Stossel: 
-- and we'll have better school. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
-- and then in addition, John, in addition, John, for soccer, I'm sorry, that costs money.  
You have to have money to buy those soccer clothes.  You have to have money to join 
the league.  And those kids don't have it.  So let's just see now.  We eliminated recess.  
We don't have physical education.  And now we don't have after school.  And where do 
they go?  To the tube, they just sit there.

John Stossel: 
I just have to disagree -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Stossel: 
-- New York City any kid can join a soccer league and if he doesn't have money the 
equipment will be given free.  There's plenty of charities around to pay for that. 
 
20:00:46  
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Let me remind you that schools are supposed to be the great equalizers in this country.  
In other words, kids come to school, some of them come from communities where they 
have adequate places to play, access to fresh fruits and vegetables.  Other children 
come from homes where there's no place to play safely, no access to fresh fruits and 
vegetables.  At school at least they should be helped in developing lifetime habits of 
physical activity and good nutrition. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to go to another question, but I want to tell folks who are in the darker area that I 
can't see you and the same is true on the sides, so if you want to ask a question you 
might take a stroll down toward the front.  In the -- I'm pointing -- yeah, yeah. 
 
Chandra Turner: 
Hi, I'm Chandra Turner [spelled phonetically].  We've talked a lot about healthy lifestyle, 
but what I want to know is what is the government's role beyond just promoting this 
healthy lifestyle that we've all kind of anecdotally realized that isn't working, what about 
the government's role in junk food in schools?  What about the government's role -- 
 
[applause] 
 
-- in taxing foods? 
 
20:01:54  
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Chandra Turner: 
What about the government's role in -- what's the other thing -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Labeling products?

Chandra Turner: 
-- the fast food industry -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah. 
 
Chandra Turner: 
-- the packaged food industry, the -- all of the junk that our kids are getting constantly?  
What is the role there?  We haven't talked about that at all. 
 
John Donvan: 
Can I ask you a specific -- 
 
Chandra Turner: 
[affirmative] 
 
John Donvan: 
-- suggest -- I mean, a specific recommendation you would want to see, for example, 
with junk food, would you want to ban it?  Would you want to label it?  Would you want 
to tax it? Would you want to change the formulation?  Forced by the government?  
Which of those things are you talking about? 
 
Chandra Turner: 
Kind of all of the above. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, I want to -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
-- I want to ask -- 
 
Chandra Turner: 
-- seriously -- 
 
John Donvan: 
John Stossel, you're going to get your chance. 
 
Chandra Turner:

the things that haven't been done yet.

John Donvan: 
Yeah, okay. 
 
Chandra Turner: 
What can be done, and what is the government's role in that? 
 
John Donvan: 
David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Yeah, I think it's an excellent question.  The government's role can be put into three 
categories.  One is this assessment where you really monitor the health of the 
population, and you give us this kind of information that we can act on.   
 
20:02:44 
 
The second one is assurance that everybody has access to the opportunity to lead 
healthy lifestyles.  The third one is policy.  And you're right, it is the responsibility of 
government to develop guidelines for healthy eating.  The Nutrition Act that's just 
passed is an effort to say, "If we're going to have free breakfast, free lunch in the 
schools for 40 to 50 percent of the children, we must make sure that those lunches are 
healthy, that they have adequate fruits and vegetables," I agree with you.  The third role 
of government is policy development, and that policy is made in such a way as to make 
sure, number one, we have the information that we need, we’ve got to have labels on 
the foods so we know what we're getting, and also you've got to make sure the children 
who are receiving these lunches are getting healthy foods. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay -- 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
That is the role of government. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to let the other side respond to that, but I want to take a quick break -- artificial 
break for radio -- which will take all of eight seconds.   
 
20:03:42 
 
And then I'm going to raise my hand and ask you to applaud.  And that'll be the 
atmospheric moment in the radio broadcast and it'll be chance for all of your hands to 
be heard by the nation.  So if you could do that, I'd appreciate it, just a round of 
applause.  Thank you.

We are back at this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate.  I'm John Donvan.  Our motion is 
"Obesity is the government's business."  We have heard the side arguing for the motion 
just recently make the case the government does have a very activist role to play in 
affecting and amending what people eat, in particularly, children.  I want to let the other 
side respond to that argument.  John Stossel. 
 
John Stossel: 
Dr. Satcher, I think you're confusing intention with results.  It's nice that we have this 
good intention, but government doesn't get the results.  Some schools now have 
banned vending machines.  A University of Pennsylvania study -- banned vending 
machines that sell unhealthy food.  They studied it.   
 
20:04:43 
 
They found the kids eat just as much junk food, no difference in weight loss.  You earlier 
said that, you know, the schools are supposed to be the great equalizer.  They are 
supposed to be, but government schools are more segregated than private schools.  It 
doesn’t work.  Government fails.  
 
John Donvan: 
David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Well, well, I don’t agree that governments fail.  Now, the study that you’re talking 
about, I don’t think anyone, even the ones who carried it out would see that as a 
conclusive study. What they said was to date, we don’t see the evidence that changing 
the vending machines -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
We’re going to keep doing more of it. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
We are going to keep working to help children develop lifetime habits of good nutrition 
and physical activity.  I think that’s our responsibility.  And that’s what the schools have 
to do. 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul Campos, arguing against the motion. 
 
Paul Campos: 
There -- I mean, I think there’s a major misunderstanding here about the way that 
society works in regard to the things that people eat and how many calories they have.   



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
20:05:41 
 
I mean, I’ve just spent the last three days on the upper west side of New York, and I’m 
surrounded by nothing but the most incredibly high caloric food that you can imagine, 
which, thanks to the neuroses of your mayor, are now made evident to me every time 
that I walk into a store because it says right there how many calories there are.  And so I 
go into this place where it’s filled 100 percent by upper class white people looking at 
these little cupcakes that have 545 calories in them, so it’s like a nuclear bomb of 
calories, right.  But is that going to cause obesity in that group?  No.  Guess why?  
Because they’re going to, you know, buy it and then slice it into eight little pieces and 
then eat it in a super neurotic way and then go to the yoga studio for two hours, right.  
Now, the notion that that kind of a social structure can be altered through these kinds 
of informational government interventions is just -- again, there’s no data to back it up.  
Now, I understand the theory that if something hasn’t worked, you can keep doing it 
until it does work, right.   
 
20:06:42 
 
That -- [unintelligible] one of the classic, you know, definitions of insanity, but that 
seems to be the government program here.  Again, do you think -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, let’s let Pamel -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Let’s let Pamela Peeke -- oh, David Satcher.  David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
It’s amazing that the same thing was said about tobacco, the effort to get people to stop 
smoking, you know.  Go back to the ’60s and the ‘70s.  It’s not working.  There’s no 
evidence.  To date, we can point to millions and millions of peoples whose lives have 
been saved because of the efforts to get people to quit smoking. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Smoking is a behavior.  Obesity is not a behavior. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
You’re wrong, wrong, absolutely wrong. 
 
Paul Campos: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Oh, absolutely wrong?  Is that why -- tell me, Pam.  Tell me, Pam, why are people fat?  
Why are people fat? 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Was it magic?  It was behavior. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Because I’m a upper-class white person who has the privilege of modifying my weight to 
an extent that most people don’t. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
And you cut your cupcake into 13 pieces. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Except, you know, right now, Pam, I weight about 185 pounds, which is supposed to be 
rather high in the overweight range.  So, apparently, I might drop dead right on the 
stage right now because according to Dr. Walter Willett, that -- to be overweight is very, 
very dangerous.   
 
20:07:44 
 
If that doesn’t happen, I suggest that people think about the possibilities that are 
actually available to people in this culture.  And I would especially want to emphasize 
that if you think that the biggest problem that poor kids have in this country right now is 
that they don’t get enough information about how much calories is in the junk food they 
eat or they don’t have enough play spaces to play outside, you’ve got a really bad 
conceptualization of what actually -- 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
You’re off-topic, Paul. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, there’s a gentleman -- the gentleman in the far corner.  Thanks, if you could 
stand up. 
 
Darrell Baxter: 
Hi, my name is Darrell Baxter [spelled phonetically], and my question is for the panelists 
for the motion, Mr. Stossell pointed out earlier that the government does get involved 
in certain programs such as subsidizing the corn subsidies.  And also, Dr. Satcher pointed 
out earlier with the nutrition program, and I recall reading the article where there was 
an exception in the nutrition program where I think it was pizza and tomato sauce are 
considered vegetables.  So, my question is to the extent government actually got out of 
the business of causing obesity through subsidies and so forth, what impact would that 
have on affecting dietary consumption?

20:08:56  
 
John Donvan: 
David Satcher. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
It’s a great point and a great question.  And I think that’s exactly what’s happening.  I 
think government is beginning to change the way we spend our money relative to foods, 
with children especially.  Look at the new nutrition act and the difference that it 
represents from what we’ve seen in the past in terms of the way children eat in school.  
So I think we are -- the government is responding to the studies that we’ve been talking 
about, showing how these foods are affecting lifestyles and therefore resulting in ill 
health, especially Type II diabetes, even in children.  So, you’re right, we, the 
government, have been at fault in many ways in terms of what’s going on in this 
country, in terms of subsidies as you pointed out. And hopefully we are making the 
changes that we need to make.   
 
20:09:46 
 
It is the role of government to continue to learn and to grow and to change.  And that's 
what we're seeing now. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sir, in the -- yes.   
 
Larry Parks: 
My name is Larry Parks.  I host the Larry Parks show on cable access.  And about a year 
ago I did a show, “Are they poisoning you?” where I addressed these issues.  And the 
question I'd like you to address is, how do you know if you get the government involved 
in this that it won't become politicized.  In the show, I say, are you being poisoned, really 
attacked the food pyramid which was -- came out of government and Walter Willet who 
both sides have mentioned, the folks you'd know he's a medical doctor, heads the 
nutrition department at Harvard University.  He wrote me that they get their people, 
the food industry gets their people on the committees to make the recommendations.  
So Dr. Satcher, you say you want healthy foods.  How do you know all this won't be 
politicized?  And the recommendations, rather than being consistent with good health, 
or rather consistent with profits of food companies? 
 
[applause] 
 
20:10:51  
 
Dr. David Satcher: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

This is a great question.  And to be honest with you, I don't know, since everything 
becomes politicized.  You know -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
You bet. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
As surgeon general, what I said was that I'm not a politician.  I speak to the American 
people based on the best available public health science.  But believe me, there were a 
lot of political pressures on me every time I did a report.  But the fact of the matter is, 
the surgeon general's report is based on the best available public health science.  It has 
to be approved by the NIH.  It has to be approved by the CDC.  It has to be approved by 
HHS.  So government is imperfect.  And it's up to us to continue to make it more perfect, 
a more perfect union.  But it's up to us to continue to push the government -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul Campos. 
 
20:11:38  
 
Paul Campos: 
I think it's really important to keep in mind that scientists are people just like everybody 
else and that science is a deeply politicized activity because it can't avoid being 
politicized given that it's about power and social policy and all the things that are 
political all the way down.  I think when we look at the food industry, one thing that 
people ought to keep in mind is that the food industry loves the obsession that 
Americans have with weight. The food industry makes enormous profits from selling 
people food that is supposed to make them thinner, right?  The diet foods have a 
significantly higher profit margin than regular foods because diet foods can be sold as a 
kind of magical elixir that's going to cause this weight loss if you buy something, which it 
doesn't have something in it that it's supposed to have in it, but which is supposedly 
then -- which has a substitute of something else.  So for instance, a fat-free Fig Newton 
has more calories in it than a regular Fig Newton.   
 
20:12:43 
 
Because the sugar that's substituting for the fat in the fat-free Fig Newton is more 
caloric. But the fat-free Fig Newton will cost more.  So the food industry loves all this 
stuff, loves the fact that we're obsessing on these issues and trying to supposedly find a 
magic cure for our supposed obesity epidemic because that's one of the main sources of 
its profit margins.  And so it encourages this kind of social hysteria. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Right here in the -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 -

Dr. David Satcher: 
Well, the way to get the price down is to make more of it, right?  Isn't that what 
happens with -- happened with computers and everything?  So in time, we ought to be 
able to get the price of Fig Newtons down. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Well, blue sweater.  Okay. 
 
Sandy Shaefer: 
Hi.  My name is Sandy Schaefer, I'm a plus-sized aerobics instructor.  And I just wanted 
to make one statement that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But very brief, okay? 
 
Sandy Shaefer: 
Yes, very -- very brief. 
 
John Donvan: 
You get a sentence. 
 
Sandy Shaefer: 
All right. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Sandy Shaefer: 
As the word "obesity" is ramped up, so is the bullying of fat children.   
 
20:13:48 
 
So my question to you is even though you say you're talking about fit, you still have the 
word "obese," and you're still targeting children and fat children specifically.  And 
they're now being bullied more and more, and it seems to be with government 
approval.  So how do you speak to that? 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, I'm going to pass on your question.  I'm going to let that stand as a -- as a darn 
good statement.  Just over on the corner up there with the -- you have the white card in 
your hand.  You still need to let the mic come to you.

Female Speaker: 
Thought this would be loud enough -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No, the radio won't pick you up.  That's the problem. 
 
Female Speaker: 
In a public school where 95 percent of students receive government assistance, whether 
we call WIC or welfare, essentially it's free lunch.  The lunchroom has machines filled 
with overpriced Doritos, chocolate chip cookies, Cheetos, et cetera, which many of the 
students purchase, often in lieu of their available free lunch that was paid for by my tax 
dollars.   
 
20:14:42 
 
Is there data regarding specifically the percent of urban welfare recipients how they 
spend their money and where they spend their money on food? 
 
John Donvan: 
What are you getting -- what do you want to get at though?  You want to say that there 
is an absence of data to know whether it's working? 
 
John Stossel: 
I think she's suggesting it's not working, that they have a free lunch, but they spend $4 
on the vending machine junk.  You can't manipulate people as well as we think you can. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Actually, there's a -- there is a fantastic study that just came out in the journal of 
sociology. And it basically showed that when you have all of this at school, and you have 
another option, many of these kids are going to what they're used to at home.  And so 
what they're not going to do is, you know, come from a home where they're eating 
trash and drinking trash and back and forth, and then suddenly magically come to 
school and go, wow, asparagus, bring it on.  They're just not going to do this.   
 
20:15:42 
 
What you're talking about is a reward system in the brain that's been hijacked.  And 
you're looking at consistent behaviors on the part of these children.  This is one of the 
reasons why -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But Pamela, let me bring it back to our motion.  So what's the government's role in this? 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Pamela Peeke: 
Well, the government's role in this, you know, is a bit more complex.  You're looking at a 
child and controlling that child and offering options there.  But you haven't talked to the 
parents.  What we need to do now is bring in the family.  If you don't have the family as 
a unit in this, then this is going nowhere fast. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
And the government -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
Am I not looking at a child to receive tax -- whose family receives tax funds -- sorry, tax-
generated funds and brought their money to school and spent it on a machine instead 
of on their healthy lunch?  And by the way, 25 out of 28 students in my class, which is 95 
percent free lunch, have cable TV.  I don't have a TV. 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul Campos. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Yeah, but what you're talking about is -- they may have the money.  They haven't made 
the connection. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Look -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul Campos. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Again, this has been studied.   
 
20:16:43 
 
There have been intense government intervention such as, for instance, the pathway 
study was based on the notion we're going to educate the kids, we're going to educate 
the parents about healthy eating habits and better physical activity.  We're going to do 
all these wonderful things that the government is advocating that we do.  And what 
those things did was that they produced some improvement in terms of lifestyle 
modification, but they did not produce weight loss.  There is no evidence that telling 
parents of children, of fatter children, that this kind of food is -- has more calories in it, 
and this has less and this is more nutrient rich, and that is less or whatever, is going to 
produce thinner children.  And I want to get back to Sandy Schaefer's point because I 
think it is an absolutely crucial one. Right now, what we are creating is a machine 
essentially for stigmatization and bullying, right, because the government is just 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

broadcasting this message 24/7, that if you're a fat kid, you have something wrong with 
you, and you have something wrong with you that happens to be your fault because you 
could modify it. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Paul, that's not just the government. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
[unintelligible]. 
 
20:17:43  
 
Pamela Peeke: 
No, no, no, no.  We're talking about the media.  Bring it on through the media.  You look 
at those magazines.  You look as those shows.  You look at the fantasy world everyone 
lives in.  That was going on a hell of a lot longer before any government intervention 
showed up. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Right.  But now you're exacerbating it. 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to -- I have time.  I have time for one more question.  I thought Sandy did it 
really when she said it the first time.  In the aisle, since you came all the way down, sir.  
Can you step forward just a little bit?  Thanks.  A little bit more.  That's great.  Thank 
you. 
 
Sakon Sharob: 
My name is Sakon Sharob [spelled phonetically].  If we take a step back from the debate 
and look at the economics of it, maybe the government side could tell us why, out of all 
actors, government itself is the best actor to step in and solve this problem, if there's a 
problem in the first place?  Dr. -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Let's take that question quickly.  David Satcher.  Why the government? 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
I think the government is the only actor.  Remember who the government is.  Public 
health is the collective efforts of a society to create the conditions in which people can 
be healthy.  
 
20:18:44 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Government calls upon all of us to work together to solve the problem.  It does it 
through public-private partnerships.  So it's not either/or.  We're not saying the 
government does this, and nobody else.  We need all hands in.  But if the government 
does not do its job, it will not get done because government has the resources, and 
nobody else does, to monitor the health of the population.  Government has the 
resources to make policies so that we can have an idea what people are eating and what 
they are exposed to in terms of information. 
 
John Donvan: 
Very quickly. 
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
So I think the government has a role that only the government can play.  But it doesn't 
mean nobody else does. 
 
John Donvan: 
Very quickly, Paul Campos. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Yeah, I'd like to point out something.  The health of the American population is better 
now than it's ever been before.  I mean, all this talk of like a huge health crisis overlooks 
the fact that in fact not only is the life expectancy the highest it's ever been and 
continuing to increase at a steady rate, but all -- the rates of almost all the major 
diseases are significantly lower than they've been before. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
Life expectancy may be up.  Health span is down.  The quality of life is decreasing 
significantly. 
 
20:19:45  
 
Paul Campos: 
Yeah, because people who are 90 are not very healthy. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
We're keeping people alive who are grossly disabled by these diseases. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes round two of this Intelligence

And here's -- we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater, in turn.  
Their closing statements will be two minutes each.  And remember we had you vote 
before the debate.  Immediately after these closing statements, which are their last 
chance to win this thing, we are going to ask you to vote again, and the team whose 
numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner.  So on to round three, 
closing statements by each debater in turn, our motion is this, "Obesity is the 
government's business."  And here to speak against the motion, John Stossel, Emmy 
Award winning host of the weekly Fox Business Network Show, "Stossel." 
 
John Stossel: 
So you talked about Medicare, and it's true, it's eaten us alive.  That's what's going to 
make us go broke fastest.  So you're saying that because we have socialized medicine, 
which everybody loves, we have to give up our freedom and invite government to come 
in and control more of our lives?   
 
20:20:51 
 
I don't think it's any coincidence that this biggest push for more food regulation comes 
at a time when Congress is obsessing about paying for everybody's health care.  When 
government pays, it's drawn into your personal life, and this is not a good thing.  It's not 
true that only government can do these things.  Free people can control their own lives. 
Government will propose to control you because you eat too much.  Will they next try 
to ban skydiving and extramarital sex?  How about another try at prohibition?  That 
might save money.  You’re going to have the government teach poor people to serve 
asparagus when we have a $3.8 trillion spending already?  [unintelligible] and 
transportation alternatives?  I'll give you money.  But you want government to build 
more bike paths?  My local councilwoman is giving out free bike helmets to encourage 
bicycle use.  You know, my neighborhood is where Jerry Seinfeld and Sting live.   
 
20:21:46 
 
I say to her, "Why would you spend public money?" "This isn't public money.  It's free.  
It's a government grant." 
 
[laughter] 
 
It's not free.  Some people say, "Well, it's just information."  And information's good, but 
it's not free.  These calorie counts which haven't worked, they raise the price of food a 
little because it costs restaurants money to post that.  And they also -- all this 
information distracts you from other information that might be more important.  This 
happens all the time when government intervenes.  You ever look at a birth control pill 
label?  I happen to have one here.

Look at this thing.  Tiny fine print, both sides, the result is nobody reads it.  It doesn't 
make us safer.  This is what government gives us. 
 
John Donvan: 
John Stossel, your time is up.  Thank you very much.

Our motion is "Obesity is the government's business," and here to summarize his 
position in support of this motion, David Satcher, the 16th surgeon general of the 
United States and director of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute. 
 
20:22:49  
 
Dr. David Satcher: 
Well, let me say that I have seen government at its worst and I've seen government at 
its best.  I know government is not perfect.  I grew up in Alabama at a time of 
segregation and discrimination.  I was a teenager when George Wallace, running for 
governor, came to town and said that he would deputize every white man in Alabama 
before he would see one black child go to the University of Alabama.  I've seen 
government at its worst.  But I've also seen government at its best.  I've seen 
government protect children from lead.  As a medical student I saw babies coming into 
emergency room with toxicity from lead.  Many of them died.  That was in the '60s.  In 
1978, the government regulated the lead content of house paint, and we've seen a 
dramatic decline in lead poisoning in children.  I've seen government at its best.   
 
20:23:45 
 
I've been involved in the eradication of polio, and all over the world, and recently 
learned that last year for the first time not one child in India suffered from polio.  And 
only three countries in the world have polio, a total of less than 700 cases in the world.  
Government at its best is "We, the people."  Government is the collective efforts of a 
society to create the conditions in which people can be healthy.  So that's what we see 
as government.  We believe that there is no substitute for individual responsibility.  Let's 
make that clear.  It's why I wrote the prescription.  But individual responsibility can only 
take place in an environment where there is equal opportunity, there is equal access to 
the opportunity for a healthy lifestyle.  It's our contention that obesity is the business of 
the government because it is the business of the government to create those 
conditions.  Thank you.

Our motion is "Obesity is the government’s business.”  And now, here to summarize his 
position against this motion, Paul Campos, who is author of “The Obesity Myth” and 
professor at the University of Colorado Law School. 
 
Paul Campos: 
Thank you.  I was watching the Super Bowl with my father who’s a retired physician and 
oncologist actually.  And we were getting bombarded, of course, with erectile 
dysfunction ad drug advertisements.  And they -- all of them have this tag line that’s 
legally required, right. “Ask your doctor if Cialis is right for you,” right.  So after about, 
you know, six of these, my father turns to me and says, “How the hell do I know if Cialis 
is right for you?”  Okay, and the point was, you know, significant in two ways.  One, first 
of all, he’s an oncologist.  He doesn’t know anything about the pharmacology of erectile 
dysfunction drugs, right, just because he’s a doctor, right.  But the more profound point 
is that you would think that the question of whether Cialis is right for me is a little bit 
more socially complex and it could be answered by a doctor, right.   
 
20:25:47 
 
You’d think there would be at least one other person who would have an opinion on 
that question besides a doctor, right.  The point of that story really is that what is now 
called erectile dysfunction used to be called being 50 years old, right.  In other words, 
we take a completely natural process and we pathologize it.  We turn it into a disease so 
that it could be treated through pharmacological intervention.  And what’s really going 
on here, and I know that our opponents are not in any way intending this, but intention, 
you know, we know the road to hell is paved with, right.  What’s happening is that all 
this talk about lifestyle intervention is something that the pharmaceutical industry loves 
because they know that that stuff doesn’t work.  And the point of all this discourse is to 
soften up the regulatory pipeline for the next generation of diet drugs.  That’s where the 
real money is, and that’s why we’re hearing about obesity, obesity, obesity all the time.   
 
20:26:47 
 
Oh, we’ll get kids to eat fruits and vegetables.  Alice Waters will make asparagus for 
everybody, and we’ll make lots of bicycle paths, and then kids won’t be fat.  But they 
will be anyways.  Until then, what will we need?  Drugs.  And that’s what I would suggest 
this is really at the bottom line all about. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Paul Campos.

This is our motion, "Obesity is the government’s business.”  And speaking last in support 
of the motion, Dr. Pamela Peeke.  She is WebMD’s chief lifestyle expert and also 
assistant clinical professor of medicine at the University of Maryland. 
 
Pamela Peeke: 
As the Discovery health correspondent, I was filming my show in South Central L.A. at 
the National Body Challenge where we take families and we try to teach them 
everything we can as physicians about being healthier.  It’s not just about dropping 
weight but being healthier.  This was a small little house.  It was 97 degrees in the 
middle of summer.  There were no sidewalks.  Or what was there was scary-looking.   
 
20:27:48 
 
And we were asked to go out and take a little walk.  And I looked near the front door, 
and there was a golf club sitting there.  Now, the closest golf course was probably about 
100 miles away.  So I asked what was that sitting there for.  And the mother looked at 
me and she said, “That’s to beat away the dogs, the feral dogs that are running all over 
the place from the drug lords who are either jailed, dead or MIA and just so we can get 
to our car.” And I said, “You have a dog yourself.  Where do you walk it?”  “We have to 
drive three-four miles away to a small park, and that’s what we do.”  So I went out, and I 
took a walk with them because my producers told me to.  And we went outside, and I 
took the fastest walk of my life.  And as we were coming around and we were being 
filmed, of course, the producers were in a car and I was on the sidewalk or whatever 
was out there, I noticed the dogs coming.  They were about three blocks away, totally 
freaked me out.   
 
20:28:43 
 
And I realized, wow, let’s break into a run.  You’re walking so well.  Let’s run.  And so we 
did, and I ran for my life.  I suddenly realized as we sat in there, as they ran into the 
house, and the kids were crying by this time because they were scared, they said, 
“Where’s the cookies?”  It feels good.  And the grandmother looking at me, saying, “No, 
we just learned something different.  Let’s just pray.”  And I looked around and I said, 
wow, obesity is the government’s business because it’s not really obesity, really, at the 
end of the day.  Wow, health, the fitness to be able to live and survive -- that’s really 
what it’s about. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Pamela Peeke.  And that concludes our closing statements.

And now it’s time to learn which side has argues best.  And now it’s time to learn which 
side has argued best.  We’re asking you again to go to those keypads at your seat to 
register your vote.  Again, our motion is this: “Obesity is the government’s business.”   
 
20:29:44 
 
If you agree with the motion, this side’s arguments, press number one.  If you disagree, 
this side's arguments, push number two.  If you remain or became undecided, push 
number three.  And we'll have the results of that vote in about one minute and 45 
seconds.  And so while we're waiting for that, I just wanted to say a couple of things.  
One, I wanted to thank these panelists for the level of integrity and intelligence and 
honesty they brought to this thing. 
 
[applause] 
 
And also, you in our audience for the questions that you brought up and for your 
boisterousness and liveliness, and it was clear you were there with all of us, so thank 
you to all of you for your participation. 
 
[applause] 
 
A couple of things about our organization, Intelligence Squared.  We are delighted that 
this was a sellout.  We've been delighted since Bob Rosenkranz set this thing up to see it 
grow and grow.   
 
20:30:46 
 
This is our 58th debate tonight.  The audiences just keep getting bigger.  We appreciate 
that you're here and that you made it down.  Please tell your friends we're going to keep 
going and keep getting bigger and better.  And to that end in fact, last week -- we do a 
podcast based out of this.  And last week, Forbes magazine published a list of the top 
five podcasts that will change the way you think.  And we were number two on that list.  
And we're delighted. 
 
[applause] 
 
And you know, it's a scary thing to change the way you think.  But you've experienced it.  
It's not so frightening.  And our next debate is on March 13th.  Our motion is this:  China 
does capitalism better than America.  And supporting the motion, speaking in support of 
the motion, Orville Schell who is director of the Asia Society Center on U.S.-China 
relations.  And his partner will be Peter Schiff who is an investment advisor and a former 
economic advisor to Ron Paul.

Speaking against, Minxin Pei, who is a professor of government at Claremont McKenna.  
And his partner is Ian Bremmer, founder of the Eurasia Group, a global risk consultancy.  
So we'll have the results in just a moment.  I just want to say that, for me, in this debate 
as a person with a very slight tendency to overweight, I -- which to me was the elephant 
in the room tonight.  I -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
I had an interesting experience today.  I've been reaching -- I did a great deal of research 
for this debate as I usually do.  I had a sheaf of stuff I've been carrying around with me.  
And I'm a New Yorker, but I now live in Washington.  So I flew up today, and I checked 
into one of those hotels where when you check in, they give you a cookie. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Like a great big, giant chocolate chip cookie.  And I looked at the cookie, and I looked 
down at my sheaf, and I have decided that I'm going to carry a sheaf with me 
everywhere I go from now on because I was able to say no to it.  So to all of those who 
wrote stuff that got into that research, I appreciate it.   
 
20:32:48 
 
So we'll have the results -- oh, they're coming out now.  So what I'm going to do is read 
the two sets of numbers and declare our winner.  Remember, the side that has changed 
its numbers the most in the course of this evening will be declared our winner.  Our 
motion is this:  "Obesity is the government's business," and here are the results.  Before 
the debate, 55 percent supported the motion.  19 percent were against, and 26 percent 
were undecided.  After the debate, 55 percent remain in support of the motion.  That 
has not changed at all.  35 percent are against.  That is up 16 percent.  10 percent are 
undecided. The side against the motion, "Obesity is the Government's Business" carries 
the debate. Our congratulations to them. 
 
[applause] 
 
And thank you from me, John Donvan of Intelligence Squared U.S.  We will see you next 
time.
