We should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports 
Moderator:                  Bob Costas 

For the motion:          Radley Balko, Norman Fost, Julian Savulescu 

Against the motion:  George Michael, Dale Murphy, Richard Pound 

 

 

 

BOB COSTAS 

…  And now I’d like to introduce Robert Rosenkranz, who is the 

chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation, and the sponsor of 

Intelligence Squared, who will frame tonight’s debate.  Bob? 

[APPLAUSE]   This is Bob.  

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Well thank you very much.  And, uh, uh, on behalf of, uh, Dana 

Wolfe, our executive producer and myself, uh, I’m just, uh, 

thrilled to welcome you. When we scheduled this event some, uh, 

five months ago, we had no idea it would be so timely.  Just in 

the past month the, uh, Mitchell Report was released, naming 

some eighty eight Major League Baseball players alleged to have 

used steroids and, uh, uh, other drugs.  Roger Clemens’ denials 

have been heard in 60 Minutes and were front page news in 

Sunday’s New York Times.  Uh, record breaking sprinter Marion 

Jones was sentenced to six weeks in prison-, or six months, I

should say, in prison, for lying to a federal grand jury about 

steroid use.  Uh, Congressional hearings, uh, on steroid use and 

the Mitchell Report actually started today in Washington. Uh, 

closer to home, just a few days ago, Ben Johnson dropped out as 

our panelist on his counsel’s insistence, because of Johnson’s 

involvement in a le-, a related legal case that was just noticed for 

trial.  Well timely we certainly are, but what is the debate?  This 

is not a debate about whether cheating in sports should be 

accepted.  That would hardly be interesting. Instead, it’s about 

whether the rules governing professional sports should ban 

performance-enhancing drugs.  After all, we routinely use 

performance-enhancing drugs, uh, to enhance our, uh, mental 

performance. A virtual pharmacopoeia of drugs is used to help 

people, including minors, stay awake, improve concentration, 

alter moods.  And the whole point of competitive sports is for 

spectators to see athletes striving to be the very best they can be. 

We want their training and equipment to use the best science and 

technology.  So why is the use of performance-enhancing drugs 

an exception? Is there persuasive evidence that these drugs are 

health risks?  If so, how do those risks stack up against the risk 

athletes assume every day by getting into a racing car or a boxing 

ring, or on a football field or a baseball diamond? Why shouldn’t 

athletes make their own informed determinations about risks and 

benefits of performance-enhancing drugs?  And how should we 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 3. 

 

 

 

think about the wisdom of rules that are inherently so intrusive 

and difficult to enforce?  Well to help us grapple with these 

interesting questions, we have an exciting panel, including 

professional athletes and medical experts.  And as our moderator, 

we have Bob Costas, perhaps the most famous sportscaster in 

television and radio today. Bob, the evening is yours. [APPLAUSE]  

BOB COSTAS 

Thank you again, Bob.  So this is the sixth debate of the second 

Intelligence Squared US Series.  The resolution being debated 

tonight is formally, you know what it is, but formally it is, we 

should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive 

sports. Here’s a brief overview of the way the evening will work.  

Members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of 

the argument, and the presentations are limited to seven minutes 

each.  When opening arguments are complete, I’ll open up the 

floor to brief questions from the audience.  And after the Q&A, 

each debater will make a final two minute summation. And 

finally, you vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad attached to 

the armrest of your seat, and I’ll announce your decision on 

which side carried the day or the evening, when, uh, the 

festivities conclude. Let’s start with a pre-debate vote.  Please 

pick up the keypad attached to the armrest on your left. For 

audience members sitting along the aisle to my right, your 

keypad is attached to the audience on your right side next to your 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

neighbor.  So, the resolution is, we should accept performance-

enhancing drugs in competitive sports.  After my prompt, please 

press one to vote for the motion, two to vote against the motion, 

or three if you are undecided.  You may begin voting now. 

[PAUSE] Has everybody cast their initial vote?  You’re all set?  All 

right.  Now to introduce the panel.  And please hold your 

applause until all six are introduced.  For the motion, former 

policy analyst for the Cato Institute, senior editor and 

investigative journalist for Reason magazine, Radley Balko on the 

far end.  Professor of pediatrics and bio-ethics, and director of the 

program in medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin, Norman 

Fost. And Uehiro chair in practical ethics at the University of 

Oxford, and director of the Oxford Center for Practical Ethics, 

Julian Savulescu. Against the motion, former host and creator of 

the Sports Machine, the award-winning sportscaster George 

Michael.  The former Atlanta Brave two-time National League 

MVP, multiple Golden glo-, Glove Award-winner, and founder of 

the I Won’t Cheat Foundation, Dale Murphy. And the former 

chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency from 1999 through 

2007, chancellor of McGill University and partner at the 

Canadian law firm Stikeman Elliot, Richard Pound. [APPLAUSE] 

For most of the evening as points of view are exchanged, all of us 

will be seated, but as each debater makes his initial seven minute 

presentation, we will call him to the podium.  And we will begin

with someone who is for the motion, “We should accept 

performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports,” Norm Fost.  

Norm?   

NORMAN FOST 

Thank you.  Everyone in this room uses performance-enhancing 

technology and drugs. We use cars and computers to make our 

work more efficient.  We use caffeine, alcohol, and Viagra to 

improve our performance.  We send our children to fancy schools 

and Suzuki lessons to improve their cognitive skills, and enhance 

their musical ability. And every athlete in recorded history has 

used performance-enhancing drugs.  Babylonians and Romans 

used herbs to improve their performance in battle.  Naked Greeks 

put on shoes to run faster.  Kenyan runners trained at altitude to 

improve their oxygen-carrying capacity.  And runners everywhere 

carbo-loaded before races to enhance their performance. Why 

then, do we have a replay of the Salem witch trials?  To discredit, 

humiliate, and incarcerate, uh, elite athletes for doing what has 

been a standard practice for millennia?   And why, out of the 

thousand and one ways in which athletes enhance their 

performance, have steroids and growth hormone been selected for 

particular vilification?  The short answer is that they’re illegal and 

that these athletes are breaking the rules and perhaps the law, 

and therefor it’s immoral. But this begs the question, as Mr. 

Rosenkranz said, why are they banned in the first place?  We 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 6. 

 

 

 

contend that the reasons given are morally incoherent, wreak of 

hypocrisy, and are based on ice cold wrong information. I will 

identify six reasons that are offered why we should ban these 

drugs.  Number one, critics say that they confer an unfair 

advantage.  But advantages are only unfair if they’re unequally 

distributed.  The usual solution is to expand access. When Bob 

Seagren showed up at the ’72 Olympics in-, with a fiberglass pole, 

it was not banned, but, a-, uh, there was a time to allow others to 

practice with it, and it was incorporated.  When Kenyan runners 

were found to enhance their performance by raising their 

hemoglobin by training at altitude, the reaction was not to ban 

abnormally high hemoglobins, or to prohibit others from training 

at altitude, but to encourage everyone to do it. The unfair 

advantage aim, uh, the unfair advantage claim is further 

undermined by rampant hypocrisy.  In the ’88 Olympics, when 

Ben Johnson lost his gold medal because of steroid use, on the 

same day and the same press den, Janet Evans, the American 

swimmer who had won the 5k swim, bragged about the greasy 

swimsuit that we had kept secret from the East Germans.  

Johnson used a drug that was available to everyone, although 

illegally, virtually on the training room tables.  Evans used a 

secret technology available to none of her competitors and 

bragged about it. The press cheered American ingenuity and 

made Johnson a pariah.  Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner,

preaches about a level playing field, but presides over a league 

where the Yankees’ payroll is three to four times that of most 

competitors, including my beloved Brewers, [AUDIENCE 

LAUGHTER] and guess what?  The Yankees always make the 

playoffs. Two, critics say these drugs are harmful, but they rely 

on information that’s wiley-, wildly exaggerated or just fabricated.  

We are told repeatedly that these drugs use heart disease, cancer, 

and stroke, while human growth hormone has been given to 

almost a million children for fifty years, and there’s still no real 

serious side effects that have been discovered.  Oral testosterone 

dis-, did cause liver cancer, but for twenty years athletes have 

been using injectables, which have never been associated with 

cancer. Lyle Alzado the football player, was a poster child for the 

horrors of steroids.  He died of a brain tumor.  Then the New York 

Times and Sports Illustrated told us on cover stories that this was 

due to steroids without a single quote from an informed physician 

or a single source showing any association with steroids, because 

there is none.  But still, Costas, I mean, excuse me, [AUDIENCE 

LAUGHTER] uh, Alzado…[LAUGHS]  

BOB COSTAS 

That is deep-, deeply, deeply Freudian. [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]  

NORMAN FOST 

…eh…Alzado is constantly rolled out as a poster child for the 

horrors of steroids.  I ask you in the audience to quickly name, in 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 8. 

 

 

 

your own minds, a single elite athlete who’s had a stroke or a 

heart attack while playing sports.  It’s hard to come up with one. 

Anabolic steroids do have undesirable side effects: acne, 

baldness, voice changes, intrangent infertility.  But sport itself is 

far more dangerous, and we don’t prohibit it. The number of 

deaths from playing professional football and college football are 

fifty to a hundred times higher than even the wild exaggerations 

about steroids.  More people have died playing baseball than have 

died of steroid use.  Three critics say that allowing their use is 

coercive, that you’re forced to use them.  But the first year that 

baseball did universal testing, anonymous testing, only six 

percent of the players were positive. From those numbers, it 

seems that 94% were able to play at a very high level and didn’t 

feel coerced at all.  Coercion is the use or threat of force that's 

never occurred in this country to the best of my knowledge.  

There is no entitlement to play professional sports; it’s a privilege 

requiring an enormous sacrifice and taking on enormous risks, 

with or without steroids.  Many walk away from it and choose not 

to do it, and no one is forced to take it on.  Four, critics claim 

that steroids undermine fan interest, and this is simply 

empirically false, baseball attendance has ridden steadily in the 

steroid era, professional football is even more popular, and Barry 

Bonds, widely assumed to be a steroid user, is the biggest draw 

in sports, adding ten thousand fannies in the seats everywhere he

goes.  Chicks love the long ball, guys love the long ball, they don’t 

care what they're using.  Fifth, critics claim that steroids 

undermine the integrity of records.  This is naïve, the records are 

not comparable with or without steroids or growth hormone.  

Baseball fences are shorter, the mound is lower, the ball is 

livelier, and Coors Field is a mile above sea level.  By one 

estimate, Babe Ruth playing in today’s ball parks would hit a 

thousand home runs, not the mere seven hundred and fifty that 

Hank Aaron and Bonds have hit.  The only valid comparison is 

with peers playing in the same arenas with the same equipment 

against the same opponents, and Ruth hit more home runs in 

one season than any other team.  He is in a league of his own, 

and no one has come close.  Finally, critics claim that steroids 

present bad role modeling for children— 

BOB COSTAS  

One minute.  

NORMAN FOST 

Everyone agrees these drugs should be banned for children.  The 

adverse effects are different, they stunt growth, they are not 

competent to make informed choices.  I support testing in 

schools, not to punish the kids, but to catch the peddlers.  

Anyone caught selling drugs to children should be hung, followed 

by a fair trial.  [LAUGHTER]  In closing, when you go out to 

dinner tonight, enjoy the wine that relaxes you, or start your day

tomorrow with a double mocha latte that gets you going, but 

please be less critical of others who, like you, try to enhance their 

performance in a variety of ways.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  

BOB COSTAS  

Thank you, Dr. Fost.  And now speaking against the motion, Dick 

Pound.  

RICHARD POUND 

Thank you.  This evening’s debate deals with one of the most 

important problems facing sport today: doping, the use of 

performance enhancing drugs and methods.  It’s important 

because it affects the health of the athletes who practice it, and 

those who emulate the sport heroes thought they admire.  It’s 

important because it goes to the very heart of sport and its 

integrity.  I want to focus on two elements in this portion of my 

remarks: health and integrity.  So let’s start at the beginning.  

Sport, like this debate, is governed by rules, to which the 

participants agree.  In fact, the rules are the essential element of 

sport as we know it.  Some of them may seem arbitrary, why the 

race is a hundred meters as opposed to ninety-five or a hundred 

and five, but they are the rules, and they are the rules on which 

we agree.  One of those sport rules is that participants do not 

take certain drugs or use certain methods for performance 

enhancement.  And also, we should be clear here, until there is a 

rule against the use of something, it may be foolish, it may be 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 11. 

 

 

 

dangerous, but it can't be criticized as a breach of ethics or a rule 

of conduct. Don’t get led off into the wilderness by examples from 

ancient Greece and so forth that preceded the rules that we now 

face today.  Once there is a rule, however, that becomes the deal, 

and part of the game, whether the rule relates to drugs, 

equipment, or anything else central to the sport.  And those rules 

become our deal with each other’s, other, as participants.  If you 

don’t like the rules, unlike society in general, you're not obliged to 

participate.  You can find somebody who wants to play by the 

rules that you prefer.  Almost all of the prohibited substances and 

methods have the potential to damage the health of the athletes.  

In the 1950’s and 1960’s before there were rules, veterinary 

products were used to beef up the human cattle. Shot putters 

went from throwing from sixty feet to seventy feet.  It’s true, they 

had terminal acne, testicles the size of jelly beans, a sperm count 

of zero, and were in a perpetual rage, but boy, they could sure 

toss the shot a lot further.  The initial anti-doping rules were 

adopted mainly as a result of concerns regarding health.  A 

Danish cyclist died during the 1960 Olympics in Rome, that was 

the Olympics in which I participated.  And he died as a result of 

drug use.  He didn't just get sick, or incur a long term health 

problem, or fall off his bike and skin his knees.  He died.  If a 

particular sport rule proves to be no good or unnecessary, or in 

need of amendment, the sport can change it.  There’s no problem 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 12. 

 

 

 

about that.  But you as a participant cannot do it unilaterally and 

clandestinely.  Why do you suppose that no one, no one with any 

responsibility, let me underline that, is willing to say let the 

athletes do whatever they want?  Even the professional leagues 

don’t say that.  They know perfectly well there’s a danger to 

health.  With the rules comes a question of trust.  We have 

expectations of each other that we play in accordance with the 

rules that we agreed upon as part of our participation, including 

rules prohibiting drug use.  We’re ready to demonstrate that 

compliance at any time, that’s also part of our deal.  We don’t 

hide behind spurious claims of privacy.  We agree on the 

penalties if there’s a breach of the rules.  And the sport rules on 

drug use are no different from sport rules regarding such things 

as gambling.  Pete Rose has been kept out of the Baseball Hall of 

Fame because of gambling, because nobody was really sure 

whether they were watching real sport.  In the, in more modern 

times, my, my view is that Henry Aaron has a record, Barry 

Bonds has a number.  When there’s a breach of that trust, you 

have to see what it is.  And drug use in sport is no more or no 

less than cheating, and in most cases, dangerous cheating.  

Remember that, that athletes don’t take these drugs to level the 

playing field.  They do it to get an advantage.  And if everyone else 

is doing what they're doing, then instead of taking ten grams or 

ten cc's or whatever it is, they’ll take twenty, or thirty, or forty, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 13. 

 

 

 

and a vicious circle simply gets bigger.  The end game will be an 

activity that’s increasingly violent, extreme, and meaningless, 

practiced by a class of chemical and/or genetic mutant 

gladiators.  The use of performance enhancing drugs is not 

accidental, it is planned and deliberate with the sole objective of 

getting an unfair advantage.  I don’t want my kids, or your kids, 

or anybody’s kids to have to turn themselves into chemical 

stockpiles just because there are cheaters out there who don’t 

care what they promised when they started to participate.  I don’t 

want my kids in the hands of a coach who would encourage, 

condone, or allow the use of drugs among his or her athletes.  I 

was always struck by Vince Lombardi, a wonderful coach.  

There’s one thing he said that I wish he hadn't, when he said, 

“Winning is the only thing.”  It’s not.  I liked it much better when 

he said, “If you're not fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with 

enthusiasm.”  That’s a much better message.  So, going forward, 

what we need is an increased change of attitude.  Cheating in 

sport destroys everything— 

BOB COSTAS  

One minute.  

RICHARD POUND 

…that the athletes set out to accomplish.  It turns them, among 

other things, into liars.  Marion Jones persisted with a lie for 

more than seven years.  Ben Johnson lied to me in 1988.  I was 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

really looking forward to having him here tonight, twenty years 

later.  It’s too bad his lawyers pulled him out of this at the last 

minute.  But attitudes can change, even big attitudes like this.  If, 

if ten years ago I had said that in ten years from today it would be 

illegal to smoke a cigarette in a restaurant in Paris, you’d have 

laughed.  So, it’s important for me to keep up, keep the question 

of doping and drug use from becoming banal and being turned 

into various shades of gray.  The issue of cheating is not gray, it’s 

black and it’s white.  Drug use may not affect fan interest, but it 

should, and that's our failure as fans, compounding the failure of 

drug-using players in the leagues.   

BOB COSTAS  

Please finish up.   

RICHARD POUND 

Are these really our personal values, that dangerous cheating is 

what we stand for?  Bishop, let me finish with Bishop Fulton 

Sheen, he had a great thing.  He said, if it’s wrong, it’s wrong.  

Even if everybody is doing it.  And if it’s right it’s right, even if 

nobody’s doing it.  [LAUGHTER]   

BOB COSTAS  

Our thanks to Dick Pound, and uh, I indicate no disapproval of 

the opinions about to be expressed by Radley Balko when I note 

that he is ironically named to be on themselves panel.  Radley, 

Radley Balko, for the motion that performance enhancing drugs 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 15. 

 

 

 

in competitive sports should be accepted.   

RADLEY BALKO 

Well, let me start by saying, for those of you who might be 

confused, I am not Ben Johnson.  [LAUGHTER]  On the train ride 

from DC this morning, we passed through Baltimore.  Doing so 

reminded me of one of my favorite authors, Baltimore native H.L. 

Mencken, who I think would have had a good laugh at the 

hypocrisy, the posturing, the uh, moral prudery that’s associated 

with this steroid controversy.  Eighty years ago Mencken aptly 

summarized this debate when he wrote, quote, “The urge to save 

humanity is almost always a false face for the urge to rule it.”  So 

why are we here tonight?  Is this about saving sport, or is this 

about some people imposing their view about what sport should 

be?  If we’re here to talk about fairness in competition, I'm 

dubious.  Take representative Tom Davis, one of the more cam-, 

camera hungry politicians to demagogue this issue. After the 

2000 census, Representative Davis maneuvered to have his 

Congressional District gerrymandered to include as many 

Republicans as possible, ensuring his continual reelection, 

eliminating the real number of options for his constituents to 

vote.  He ran the next year unopposed.  Davis also snuck a, a 

provision into an unrelated piece of Federal legislation preventing 

an apartment complex from going up in his district because, he 

told the Washington Post, he feared it would bring too many 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 16. 

 

 

 

Democrats into the district.  This guy is cheating at Democracy, 

and he’s lecturing baseball players about fairness.  If we want to 

talk about the health risks of professional sports, we might 

discuss the ballooning weight of NFL lineman over the last twenty 

years, or the corresponding life, drop in life expectancy that’s 

come with it.  Or you might talk about the particularly hellish 

world of thoroughbred horse racing jockeys, who subject 

themselves to sweat boxes, diuretics, suppositories, and 

intentional eating disorders.  In fact, any world class athlete 

subjects his body to stresses it wasn’t really designed to endure.  

And as we’ve seen with government bans on consensual activity, 

from alcohol to gambling to cocaine to prostitution, prohibitions 

not only don’t work, they make the activity in question more 

dangerous by pushing it underground.  So what about the 

children?  Survey data actually shows that teen steroid use has 

mirrored the use of other elicit drugs over the years.  It went up 

mildly in the 1990’s, and has since either dropped off slightly, or 

leveled off since 2000.  It’s likely that the same trends that govern 

cocaine or marijuana use govern teen steroid use far more than 

what’s happening in the sports pages.  In fact, a study released 

last year, and one of the few studies to actually attempt to find 

out what motivates teen boys to take steroids, found that the 

most reliable indicator of steroid use was a teen’s own self, self 

esteem and body image.  The suggestion, and I think we can all 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 17. 

 

 

 

agree it’s pretty intuitive, is that teenage boys who do take 

steroids do so not because they want to look like Barry Bonds or 

Mark McGwire, but because they want to look good for teenage 

girls.  So what is this debate really all about?  I’d suggest it’s 

about paternalism, and it’s about control.  We have a full blown 

moral panic on our hands here, and it’s over a set of substances 

that, for whatever reason, has attracted the ire of the people who 

have made it their job to tell us what is and isn't good for us.  Our 

society has an oddly schizophrenic relationship with 

pharmaceuticals and medical technology.  If something could be 

said to be natural, we tend to be OK with it.  If it’s lab made or 

synthetic, we tend to be leery.  But even synthetic drugs and 

man-made technology seem to be OK if the aim is to make sick 

people better, or broken people whole again.  And so when we 

talk about expanding or transcending what we consider to be 

normal, uh, then a certain uneasiness starts to set in.  There was 

an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education last month about 

university professors taking stimulants like Adderall to increase 

their academic productivity.  Oddly, the article quoted, quoted 

several professors who considered this cheating at academics.  I 

have to confess, I really don’t understand this way of thinking.  

Academics is the search for truth and knowledge, if a drug can 

make that search more productive with few side effects, why in 

the world wouldn't you take it?  It’s also important to note that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 18. 

 

 

 

what we consider completely natural and acceptable today was 

quite out of the ordinary not too long ago.  A hundred years ago 

life expectancy in the US was fifty, today it’s seventy-eight.  

Thanks to technology, medicine, and pharmaceutical, we’re today 

taller, stronger, faster, healthier, and expecting to live longer than 

ever before. Genetically advanced agriculture, anti-aging 

technology, and other advancements we’ve yet to see today will 

likely push our longevity even farther.  It’s an old cliché that 

sports is a metaphor for the human condition, but there’s a lot of 

truth to that.  As technology helped humanity obliterate a lot of 

these milestones, and helped us move beyond what, until a 

hundred years ago, had been a long, bleak history, similar 

advances over the years in nutrition, training, and using 

technology to improve technique have enabled sports records to 

fall with astonishing regularity.  Sports is about exploring and 

stretching the lengths of human potential.  Going back to even 

the pre-modern Olympics, when athletes ate live bees, and ate 

crushed sheep testicles to get a leg up on the competition, uh, 

sports has never been about physical ability alone.  It’s been, 

been about ingenuity, innovation, and knowledge about what 

makes us faster and stronger, and avoiding what might do us 

harm.  It’s always been part of the game.  It shouldn't be 

surprising, then, that many of the biggest proponents of banning 

performance enhancing drugs in sports are also suspect of some 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 19. 

 

 

 

of these continued advancements in human achievement.  Leon 

Kass, former, formerly President Bush’s top advisor on bio-ethics, 

this is the same Mr. Kass who champions rigorous sports testing, 

has also spent much of his career actually lamenting the fact that 

human beings are living longer than ever before.  He considers 

this contrary to some odd concept of natural order.  Uh, of course 

there have been luddites and naturalists like Mr. Kass standing 

athwart the tide— 

BOB COSTAS  

One minute.  

RADLEY BALKO 

…of human progress for much of human history.  The essence of 

the agreement today I think is what people like Mr. Kass and 

some of our opponents tonight, they have a decidedly different 

definition of what’s pure, natural, and human than what I do.  I 

think the difference is that I'm sort of willing to take a live and let 

live approach and let everyone sort of explore their own 

boundaries and their own potential.  Um, whereas I think some of 

our opponents are more interested in opposing their view of what 

is natural and what is, uh, human on everyone else, which of 

course brings us back to Mencken.  I think, uh, our opponents 

want to legislate away what they believe are bad decisions, and if 

a free society means anything, it means we should be able to 

make all decisions, including the bad ones.  Thank you.

[APPLAUSE]  

BOB COSTAS  

Radley Balko, thank you.  And now speaking against the motion, 

Dale Murphy.   

DALE MURPHY 

To, to accept this motion would simply set us back.  Accurately 

just mentioned, studies, recent studies are showing that young 

athletes and high school kids are, are using performance 

enhancing drugs to a lesser degree.  To legitimize, um, the 

performance enhancing drugs in sports I feel would send the 

wrong message to young athletes.  There are certainly legitimate 

uses for human growth hormone and steroids, um, as, as we all 

know.  That’s why they’re a controlled substance under a doctor’s 

orders.  But to hit a baseball further, or to run a hundred yard 

dash faster is not the reason and the legitimate use of these, uh, 

of these drugs. Um, Dr. Fost mentioned that at one point in time 

there were six percent that were using, um, performance 

enhancing drugs in the major leagues.  It really makes my point 

exactly.  Ninety-four percent of the guys were not using, then that 

tells me that you don’t need these things to be the best athlete in 

the world, that there are plenty of legitimate ways to get bigger, 

stronger, and faster that everyone has access to, equal access to.  

Um, if accepted, what about those, for instance, in Major League 

Baseball, what about those who do not want to use it?  The 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 21. 

 

 

 

playing field, then, once again, is, is not level.  Um, the only way, 

someone said earlier, the only way you could probably make this 

work is that if you forced everybody to take performance 

enhancing drugs, which um, we all know wouldn't work. Um, 

people do not want to see, I would argue the point that people do 

not want to see performances, uh, based on, uh, false premises, 

that it is, it is their ability, athletically or psychologically or 

mentally, alone, um, that if it’s being enhanced people do not 

want, accept that.  You mentioned Barry Bonds adding, um, 

seats, um, fans in the seats every game he played.  I would have 

to say that in San Francisco he was, um, generally accepted, but 

everywhere else he went, I think those ten thousand extra went 

there to jeer him and his accomplishments.  After the season, 

after all this has come out with Mark McGwire, I think most of us 

look back now and say we got caught up in something that we 

really didn't want to support.  If there was no alternative, I could 

understand us giving into this problem.  Certainly there are a lot 

of problems that young people have and society has.  But this is 

one of them.  If, uh, if there are a, a percentage of young athletes 

still taking performance enhancing drugs, to me it’s still a 

problem.  Um, and if there was no answer to, uh, this problem I 

think I would understand giving in, and voting, uh, in favor of 

this motion.  But I believe that there is a pro—there is an answer 

to the problem.  And, uh, as was mentioned earlier we look at 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 22. 

 

 

 

smoking in public.   Uh, we— most of us grew up with that being 

totally acceptable and now it’s against the law, there’s truly been 

a culture change.  There can be a change in culture in 

professional athletics, and I believe that it is starting.  We need, 

uh, better testing, harsher punishments, and, and people will 

decide not to get involved with performance-enhancing drugs.  

Uh, gambling in baseball is the perfect example.  Um, the culture 

of, uh, professional baseball players is the one thing they know, 

and, and one thing they learn from the minute they sign a 

professional contract, is that if you gamble on the game in any 

way, shape or form, your career will be over.   Uh, my 

understanding is, uh, I don’t have any statistics to show this, but 

once one of the greatest hitters, uh, is kicked out of the game 

because he gambled on the sport, that reinforced the culture in 

baseball that you don’t gamble on baseball.   I believe we can 

change the culture, and to accept this motion, really would set us 

back with the progress that we have made.  After tonight, I think 

you will see—you will feel, uh, as you listen closely, that, you feel 

as I do, that there is no sustainable, logical, reasonable, um, uh… 

reason, for these things to be accepted.   If you put any of these, 

uh, alleg—these, uh, positions under scrutiny, I think you will all 

come to understand, that we simply do not need this in sports at 

any level.  Let alone the high school kids that see professional 

athletes and are tempted to use them.   If you put an age limit on 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 23. 

 

 

 

use, you’re still gonna have abuse at the younger ages.  To me it’d 

be much better…to change the culture and the idea and the 

thinking about competing in sports.  And we are making 

progress, and studies have shown that.  Certainly we don’t want 

all of our athletes to look like the American Gladi—Gladiators or 

professional wrestlers.  Um…if, if that’s what we want, with all of 

our ath—athletes, um, then I can understand that but I don’t 

think that’s what the public wants.   As far as baseball is 

concerned, certainly people like the long ball.  Um, but, uh, this, 

this past year was, in the la—in the last 10 years, this past year, 

had the seventh fewest home runs of the last decade, and yet we 

broke records again with attendance.   Attendance is good, home 

runs do not have to be up.  People love the game, they appreciate 

the game, they appreciate finesse.  Um, again, we don’t all want 

to look like professional wrestlers out there and I don’t think 

that’s what the fans want.   Um…uh…I think the, uh, um…the 

thing too you need to be careful about is drawing, uh, as—   

BOB COSTAS 

One minute—   

DALE MURPHY 

—as was mentioned earlier is drawing, um, the opposing side, 

drawing, drawing analogies and conclusions, with things that 

really are not, uh, are not comparable.   For instance— um, um, 

comparing, uh, anabolic steroids or performance-enhancing 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 24. 

 

 

 

drugs to the Greeks wearing tennis shoes.  Or to the ancient 

Greek athletes, uh, eating bees.  This is not what we’re talking 

about and that is not—to me does not compare, what we’re 

talking about, is drugs that are a controlled substance that have 

very many good, legitimate uses.   As was mentioned over a 

million kids take human growth hormone, they don’t take human 

growth hormone without exhaustive studies to make sure that 

they are not already producing enough on their own.   When kids 

abuse these drugs, and athletes abuse these drugs, I don’t think 

there’s any question that we know, uh, that there are side effects.  

And some of ‘em we do not know now.   

BOB COSTAS 

Wrap up—   

DALE MURPHY 

Especially with our use.  What concerns me is the example that 

the athletes at the highest level set for our youth.  I feel like we’re 

making progress and a vote in favor of this motion would, would, 

uh, be definitely a step backward, backward, in our efforts to, uh, 

correct this problem.  Thank you.    

BOB COSTAS 

Dale Murphy, thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Now as the format 

indicates before we hear from Julian and from George, I’ll direct, 

uh, a question of my own toward either side of the debate.  Dick 

Pound, you have stated that there are obvious health risks to the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 25. 

 

 

 

use of performance-enhancing drugs, steroids in particular.  Are 

those health risks truly obvious.    

RICHARD POUND 

I—I think they are too anybody who’s, who’s studied these, uh, 

issues, and, and I think it—they’re obvious to, uh, the folks that 

have had to deal with, uh, badly damaged or dead athletes.  If 

you take cycling as an example they, there, there’ve been dozens 

and dozens and dozens of, of, of young men who’ve had heart 

attacks.   They’ve had heart attacks because their hearts can’t 

pump the sludge that their blood has become, uh, as a result of 

EPO.   

BOB COSTAS 

Doctor—   

RICHARD POUND 

So yes, there are real dangers—   

BOB COSTAS  

Dr. Fost points out that, there have been more players killed, one 

at the major league level and many at the amateur level, playing 

baseball, than have been killed because of steroid use as baseball 

players.  And many more killed or seriously injured playing 

football, which is incidental to playing the sport, than…we’re able 

to determine have suffered serious health consequences because 

of steroid use, how would you respond to that?  [PAUSE]  Yes—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 26. 

 

 

 

RICHARD POUND 

Me still?  I—I would say that the, part of the difficulty with this is, 

is collecting data, both his and, and other data, because, for 

many years, all of this use has been clandestine, and hidden.  

And so you don’t have the, the, the, the data that are, uh, as 

accurate or as complete as you’d like.   

BOB COSTAS  

Radley Balko, uh, you are advocating a live-and-let-live approach 

to this.  Isn’t it a reasonable response to that to say, fine, that’s 

one argument for a different day about society in general.  But all 

sports have rules which regulate the competition.   No one can 

stop me in my back yard from using an aluminum bat if I wanna 

play a game of my own.  But they can in a major league game.  

Cork and saliva are perfectly natural and legal substances but 

not in the context of major league baseball.  So why are these—

why are these things analogous.   

RADLEY BALKO 

Well, I—I agree, um, I think we’re—what we’re debating tonight is 

what the rules ought to be, um, I’m not advocating, uh, uh, I’m 

not defending the people who have been caught cheating, I think, 

uh, I think Mr. Pound is right, when you enter into a league and 

you agree to, to compete, uh, you agree to a predetermined set of 

rules.   Um, but I think tonight what we’re trying to determine is, 

is what those rules ought to be.  Um, and I think that, you know, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 27. 

 

 

 

I think that athletes, uh, care about their bodies and they care 

about their, their earning potential.  Uh, they care about the next 

season, and I think they are going to seek out a competitive 

advantage, but they’re not going to do so to the point where, they 

jeopardize future earning potential or they jeopardize the next 

season.  I think, I think people, uh, have, I think athletes have a 

little bit, uh, more respect for their bodies than that.    

BOB COSTAS  

Although you’re probably aware that there have been surveys of 

Olympic athletes who have been asked the question, if it would 

guarantee a gold medal, would you reduce your life expectancy by 

20 years to get it.   You’re dealing with people who are in their 

late teens to…early twenties in many cases, they have a certain 

sense of vulnerability, a reduced lifespan from 80 to 60 may seem 

somewhere in the distant future.  A huge percentage of them 

answer yes.    

RADLEY BALKO 

Well, I mean and if, if the, you know, US Olympic Committee 

wants to, to, uh, set those rules, uh, you know, I, I, I think there 

are important distinctions to be drawn, uh, uh, between amateur 

athletics and professional athletics but, uh, you know, I—I think, 

uh, a couple ones, I think…  First of all I think, private leagues 

and private sports, uh, professional sports organizations should 

be able to set their own rules, I’m not advocating, uh, that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 28. 

 

 

 

Congress mandate to the, the NFL that they have to allow 

performance-enhancing drugs.  Uh, but I also think, don’t think 

that it’s any business of Congress telling leagues that they’re—

they have to ban them as well, uh, I think that, uh, uh, the 

league should be able to set their own rules and I think the 

people will, uh, athletes will, will, uh…lobby to get the rules that 

both reflect their desire to get a competitive advantage but also 

protect their health.   

BOB COSTAS  

All right, now let’s, uh, return to the formal presentations, and, 

uh…presenting his viewpoint for the motion, Julian Savulescu.    

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

The finest, uh, Italian cyclist, Fausto Coppi was once asked, and 

winner of the Tour de France was once asked, uh…how often had 

he taken la bamba, or amphetamines during his career, he said, 

only when absolutely necessary.  And when asked precisely how 

often that was he said, almost always.  [LAUGHTER]  Another 

Tour de France, Jacques Anquetil in a debate with a French 

politician said, what do you expect us to do, ride the tour on 

mineral water?  Where our team agrees with, uh, Dick Pound 

and, and, uh, the opposition is that this is really only the tip of 

the iceberg.   The war on drugs has failed, drugs have always 

been present in sport, and we’re only seeing probably less than 5 

percent of the drug-takers being caught.  Not only has it failed, it 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 29. 

 

 

 

must fail.  Growth hormone is extremely difficult to detect, blood 

doping is also extremely difficult to detect, and in the future we’ll 

have gene doping.   Insulin-like growth factor can be injected into 

muscles, to improve muscular strength, it would have to be 

detected with a muscle biopsy.  Uh, science has created super-

mice capable of running six, uh, kilometers instead of 200 

meters, by altering their glucose metabolism.   They’ve created 

Schwarzenegger mice with vastly stronger muscles and marathon 

mice capable of running much faster marathons, these could all 

be done in humans.  We will not be able to detect these changes.   

Not only is the war on drugs bound to fail, uh, it also has other 

adverse effects, it reduces interest, this year, uh, in the Tour de 

France the race leader Michael Rasmussen, was, uh, sacked by 

his team on allegations of taking drugs.   There’s always a cloud 

over winners, of whether they’re taking drugs or not.  It’s unfair, 

the honest athletes are penalized because they’re denied access to 

safe performance enhancers and of course the rich can buy the 

undetectable enhancers.   They can buy hypoxic air tents for 

7000 US dollars which are legal, whereas EPO, which is banned, 

costs only 120 US dollars a month.  But most of all it’s unsafe.  

What happens is there’s pressure to develop undetectable 

performance enhancers with no eye to the safety.   The BALCO 

scandal illustrates what a back yard situation we have at the 

moment.  What is policy and the current zero-tolerance approach 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 30. 

 

 

 

to drugs in sport, is inconsistent and confused.  External 

technologies like hypoxic air tents, or altitude training, are 

acceptable, they raise the red blood cell level, yet if we do this 

directly by retransfusing our own blood, blood doping, or using 

EPO, a natural hormone, that’s illegal.   Yet they all have exactly 

the same effect.  Some enhancers have been permitted in sport.  

Caffeine increases the time to exhaustion, or reduces the time, 

uh, increases the time to exhaustion by 20 percent.  It used to be 

illegal, athletes were stripped of their medals for taking caffeine, 

it’s now legal, and it hasn’t corrupted the spirit of sport, it hasn’t 

had the effect of creating violent mutant gladiators, as the 

opposition has suggested.   Creatine also increase the time to 

exhaustion by 10 percent, it’s also legal.  Tour de France riders 

use intravenous nutrition to give them enough calories, uh, 

overnight, and of course Tiger Woods has used lasik eye surgery 

to give him better than 20/20 vision.  None of these have had 

adverse effect on sport.   One of the major arguments is that it’s 

against the spirit and integrity of sport, Dick Pound wrote—raised 

this issue.  When Dick Pound was asked in an interview with the 

New York Times which performance enhancements he thought 

were against the spirit of sport he said, it’s like pornography.  You 

know it when you see it.   Well of course D.H. Lawrence’s novels 

were thought to be pornographic a century ago, they’re not now.  

Professional classical musicians regularly take beta blockers to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 31. 

 

 

 

reduce, trim and enhance their performance.   The music sounds 

good, it’s not against the spirit of music.  The spirit of sport is 

entailed in what sport is, it’s the display of human physical 

excellence.  Indeed, just as we can increase the artistic 

expression through the use of beta blockers to enhance musical 

performance we could use them to enhance performance in 

archery, or indeed, in many, uh, sports requiring control of 

anxiety.   Ben Johnson famously said, the human body was not 

meant to run at the speeds it’s asked to run today.  To recover 

from the grueling training necessary to run those times you need 

steroids to increa—increase recovery.   And of course, Tiger 

Woods has used lasik eye surgery, and that hasn’t been seen to 

compromise the spirit of golf.  To say that we should 

reduce…drugs in sport or eliminate them because they increase 

performance, is simply like saying that we should eliminate 

alcohol from parties because it increases sociability.   So our 

proposal, is that we allow a modest approach.  We allow 

performance enhancers which are safe, and consistent with the 

risks that athletes already entail.  You’ll notice that Dick Bou—

Dick Pound has had to reel out examples from the ‘60s of deaths 

from steroids, when they were taken orally.   And indeed the 

blood doping deaths all occurred in the ‘90s before the 

International Cycling Union set a maximum hem—hematocrit of 

50 percent.  No athlete today is dying in competition from taking 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 32. 

 

 

 

EPO.  Indeed I would prefer to take growth hormone prescribed 

by a doctor, than compete in professional American football, 

because I know of no ventilator-dependent quadriplegic caused by 

taking growth hormone.   The drugs need to be consistent with 

the spirit of an activity, creating webbed hands and feet, which is 

possible, which is possible, would compromise the spirit of 

spearing— swimming.  But allowing athletes to recover from 

injuries consistent of sport.   We should set limits, as the 

International Cycling Union has done, on the hermatocrit…and 

test health, not test for drugs.  It makes no difference whether an 

athlete’s hermatocrit goes from 46 to 48 percent, by altitude 

training or by taking EPO or blood doping.  It’s a waste of time 

trying to detect [UNCLEAR]—   

BOB COSTAS 

One minute.    

JULIAN SAVULESCU  

Drugs in sport, far from being against the sport, embodies the 

human spirit.  We are not horses or dogs, flogged to display our 

maximum biological potential, the spirit of being human, is to 

make choices.  To be human is to be better.   To make, to make 

choices, and performance enhancement as we’ve argued per se is 

not against the spirit of sport, it embodies the history and spirit 

of sport.  It’s true that cheating is ruining sport.  But there are 

two ways to reduce cheating.   One is to ramp up the war on 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 33. 

 

 

 

drugs which is bound to fail, the other is to change the rule, the 

rules to allow regulated, supervised access.  We agree that you 

should hear—adhere to the rules.   But the rules will provide a 

better spectacle, protect the athlete’s health, narrow the gap 

between the cheaters and the honest athletes, if we allow access 

to safe performance enhancers.  One of the greatest advantages of 

allowing, uh, the, the access—   

BOB COSTAS 

Please wrap up.    

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

—the access to performance enhancement is the, the limited 

funds that are used by what are $22 million, could be better 

devoted to detecting those drugs which are seriously against 

athletes’ health, rather than wasting time on substances that do 

not harm their health, and are actually already a part of the 

sport.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

BOB COSTAS  

Julian Savulescu, thank you, and now our sixth and final 

debater, speaking against the motion, George Michael, George.    

GEORGE MICHAEL 

Don’t start my timer.  He’s from St. Louis, he’s a Cardinal fan like 

me.  Bob, I have embroidered Mark McGwire’s 70 home run 

single-season T-shirts, $39, do you have any?  Do you wear ‘em?

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 34. 

 

 

 

BOB COSTAS 

Uh, they’d be too big for me.  [LAUGHTER]    

GEORGE MICHAEL 

I gotta give mine away, it kills me that he had to be on anabolic 

steroids but that’s another story, the reason I’m here tonight, is 

that I’ve talked to a lot of these athletes, I’ve spent the last…I 

guess since I first talked to Rich Pound almost, almost six weeks 

talking to athletes…and trainers, and they all say the same thing.  

Don’t use my name.  Don’t use my name.   So I’ll avoid the names 

but there are a couple things we need to know.  Number one, the 

rules of the game say that steroids and for good reason, 

performance-enhancing drugs are absolutely illegal.  Cheating is 

cheating and you can’t change it, you can do it any way you want 

with any documentary but you can’t change it.  Steroids however 

you have to know this.  They will make you faster, they will make 

you stronger, and they make help you look and feel and be 

younger.  That’s a lot of attraction.  Steroids will make you 

wealthy.  Steroids will make you famous.  Steroids will help you 

get success and if you don’t believe it, look at some of the guys 

that hold the records.   During the course of my preparation I 

talked to a Hall of Famer.  I said let me ask you something.  I said 

with the steroids, you didn’t have ‘em when you were playing.  

What if there were steroids now.  And he said if it got me back on 

the field, regardless of the penalty, I’d do it.   I thought man, Hall 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 35. 

 

 

 

of Famer, you wanna play—he said you don’t know what it’s like, 

not to be able to excel at the game anymore.  Said steroids are the 

greatest attraction, it’s like walking on the beach with no one 

around, you and a beautiful girl.  You know what’s gonna 

happen.  [LAUGHTER]   Said, well.  I had to tell my wife, I can’t 

talk about that one.  However…even though there is no clinical 

proof, let me repeat, there is no clinical proof that steroids 

directly lead to death, there are certain guys have suffered 

something, now, Lyle Alzado was mentioned.   Lyle Alzado is—

as—Alzado is not a name to me.  I knew him, I interviewed him, I 

liked him.  Thought he was crazy, but that’s why we got along.  

Lyle Alzado…this is what’s not commonly discussed, when he was 

a freshman in college, weighed 190 pounds.   When he graduated 

as a senior and he started steroids in 1969 as a freshman.  When 

he graduated it was 300-pound muscle mass.  That’s a gain of 

110 pounds, and you knew he was going big in the NFL draft.  

Went on to become the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1977.   

Couple of weeks before he died he said, damn, if I’d never done 

steroids and human growth hormone, I wouldn’t be dying today.  

He died, at the age of 43.  43 years old.  Ken Caminiti.  He’s a 

third baseman for the Padres, it’s spring of 1996.  He’s chasing a 

fly ball, he goes out, he dives.  He tears his rotator cuff.   Ken 

Caminiti was a good guy, a tough guy, a bull of a guy. He said I 

gotta get well, so he played even though he was in great pain.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 36. 

 

 

 

Said Ken.  Go down to Tijuana, get you some anabolic steroids, 

you’ll be back on the field better than ever.  So he did.   In the 

year 1996 when he got hooked on steroids and didn’t just do 

cycles, but did double cycles, so don’t tell me we’re gonna monitor 

it.  Ain’t nobody gonna monitor it.  He used so much steroids, 

that he became a giant of a man, he was bulging, Ken Caminiti 

went from hitting .282, to hitting .330.   He went from 23 home 

runs to 40 home runs, he had 130 RBI’s, he made millions on a 

free-agent contract, and, he was absolutely hooked, he said, the 

more I used the more I had to use, because if I didn’t use I felt 

like I was going on the field naked.  Nobody wants to walk out on 

a field naked.   But that’s how he felt.  ‘Cause he said, I was 

hooked.  He was the MVP of baseball in 1996.  Eight years later 

he was dead, at the age of 40.  But, there’s no clinical proof that 

steroids led to his death.  Even though, he was an ala—anabolic 

steroid type free.   If any of you are Yankee fans, think back to 

1999.  The Yankees win the World Series.  They have a relief 

pitcher you may or may not have heard of named Dan Naulty.  

You ever heard of him, Bob?   

BOB COSTAS 

Yes.    

GEORGE MICHAEL 

Dan Naulty pitched for the Twins then became [sic] with the 

Yanks.  Now follow this, in 1992 Don Naulty was six foot eight, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 37. 

 

 

 

he’s a strapping right-hander, he weighs only 165 pounds.  Guy 

said to him, Don, you gotta get on some steroids, man, you put 

some body on you.  So he did.   In 1999 he was with the Yankees, 

he weighed 245 pounds.  That’s a weight gain of 60 pounds.  And 

it was all muscle.  Unfortunately he described himself as being 

suicidal, he said, “I was absolutely nutso.”  Now he didn’t die, he 

survived.  But he had to have major surgery because his veins 

were clotted against his arteries.   He had to have major surgery 

because he tore the muscle right off—the, the muscle and the 

groin completely off the bone.  Dr. James Andrews, a man I 

consider to be one of the foremost absolutely best surgeons of all.  

He said—he’s a north—noted orthopedic surgeon, he said 

that…now check this out.   That in 2002, 17 percent…17 percent 

of total baseball payroll went to guys who were on the injured list 

with muscle tears, muscle strains, ruptured Achilles tendon, and 

on goes the list.  He said that we have had a 200 percent increase 

in just the five years prior to 2002.   Baseball owners paid $370 

million to players who were not able to play.  Most of them 

accord9ing to Dr. Andrews, were related to their use of anabolic 

steroids.  And you now wanna admit—legalize it, and govern it?  

No definitive clinical proof though, that it was the result of 

steroids.  No proof.   I’m probably the only guy in the room who is 

friends with professional wrestlers, I started in 1980 with Bob 

Backlund.  I’ve MC’d a lot of their events, I’ve enjoyed ‘em, I love 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

‘em.  Guys that are just names to you like Hulk Hogan, Ricky 

Steamboat, Nature Boy, Rick Flair, these are all friends of mine.  I 

wanted to call and check with some of the wrestlers—   

BOB COSTAS 

One minute—   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

—I used to know, how they’re doing today.  How’d they recover 

after the use of steroids.  I went to call ‘em and you know what I 

found?  Of the wrestlers who were professional stars, 40 were 

dead by the age of 40.  70 were dead by the age of 50.  But there’s 

no clinical proof that they died of steroid abuse even though they 

all used steroids.   Here’s the bottom line.  I am not willing to pay 

the price for legalizing steroids and performance-enhancing 

drugs, ‘cause I’ve seen too often what it can do.  I don’t wanna go 

to the cemetery and tell all the athletes who are dead there, hey 

guys, soon you’ll have a lot more of your friends coming, because 

we’re gonna legalize this stuff.   The only good news out of it?  

They wouldn’t hear the news.  Because they’re all dead.  Thank 

you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

BOB COSTAS  

Our thanks to George Michael, and again, according to the format 

I’ll pose a question to each side of the table.  Dr. Fost, if there 

were unfettered access to performance-enhancing drugs, isn’t it 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 39. 

 

 

 

reasonable to posit that, even now, or even during the so-called 

steroid era, there were some constraints, some fear of being, uh, 

caught, there were some tests, however flawed—  But if it’s all 

wide open, it would go beyond any levels we’ve seen heretofore, 

and could possibly, get into an area where not only would the 

competition be grotesque, but where there would be real and 

verifiable health risks.    

NORMAN FOST 

Nobody knows but my guess is it would be exactly the opposite.   

BOB COSTAS 

Why.    

NORMAN FOST 

Because if athletes could go to doctors and get drugs without 

having to go to Mexico or to BALCO Labs, they could A, get drugs 

which had been studied and tested and approved by the FDA, 

they’d know what they were taking.  They could get drugs that 

would be manufactured in an American manufacturing facility 

with oversight by the FDA, and they’d be getting advice from 

doctors on which drugs were safe and effe— effective, which now 

they can’t find out even if they want to because the stuff comes 

from Mexico.    

BOB COSTAS  

All right, suppose we were to adopt Julian’s suggestion, that there 

were regulated, permissible regulated use of performance-



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 40. 

 

 

 

enhancing drugs, and in each case it was appropriate to the spirit 

of the particular sport, that’s fine in the ideal.   But it’s naïve to 

believe that each competitor, many of them obsessed with victory 

and believing in the full bloom of youth that they’re invulnerable, 

would stay within those limits, once there were unfettered access, 

they could just take as much as they wanted to gain whatever 

short-term competitive advantage they wanted, couldn’t they?    

NORMAN FOST 

Uh, whatever a doctor would prescribe to them and probably 

some would go outside the system as they do now—   

BOB COSTAS  

Well couldn’t they get more than the doctor prescribed, people do 

that all the time now with HGH, there’s a certain amount you can 

prescribe plausibly for certain conditions, even for anti-aging 

purpose, and people just double it, triple it, quadruple it, to 

whatever level they want, right?   

NORMAN FOST 

Yeah, that’s what they’re doing now, the difference is that you’d 

have drugs which could be tested, you’d have follow-up studies so 

that they would know what the facts are. You’d know whether 

any of these deaths that George Michael refers to have anything 

to do with steroids.  As he said, there’s no evidence that they do.   

But there are other adverse effects of steroids that I would worry 

about, but we’ll never find out about them, because we can't 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate

study them.  So, I think athletes might be more constrained from 

using them if there was more data out there that they could know 

about.   

BOB COSTAS  

Anybody else on this side of the table want to add anything to 

that, or respond?   

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

Can I?  

BOB COSTAS 

Julian.   

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

So what, if this is the honest athlete, and this is the cheater, at 

the moment the cheater has a significant advantage.   

BOB COSTAS  

Part of this will be heard on radio.  So Julian is holding his left 

arm at a certain level and his right arm above it.  [LAUGHTER] 

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

So, so what will happen if you allow access to safe performance 

enhancers is the honest athletes will come up, but of course the 

cheaters will still take, as you suggest, an advantage in the black 

market.  But what you will be doing is narrowing the advantage 

that the cheater has, because now there’s a market for safe 

performance enhancement.  So you’ve made the honest athletes 

better off by bringing them closer to the cheaters without 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 42. 

 

 

 

compromising their health.  That's the reason why you want to 

create a market for safe performance enhancers.  So growth 

hormone, we heard all this discussion about steroids, growth 

hormone is a very safe substance.  Now, you may be able to 

achieve a lot of the benefits that you can achieve with steroids by 

using growth, growth hormone.  And you’ll be developing new 

substances that will be competitors for, at the moment, the stuff 

that, that is simply on the black market.  

BOB COSTAS  

George?   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

Julian.  Would you hear what you just said!  If I don’t want to do 

drugs, I can't play against you.   

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

If you don’t want to take the risks of a spinal cord injury, you 

can't play professional football.   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

No, come on, say with the drugs— 

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

No, no, no— 

NORMAN FOST  

George, George, there’s a, for three years in the NFL there’s a 

ninety percent chance of permanent disability.  If you want to 

play in the NFL, that’s what you buy into.  People choose to do

it…  

[OVERLAPPING VOICES]  

BOB COSTAS 

How do you, how do you define permanent disability?   

[OVERLAPPING VOICES]  

GEORGE MICHAEL 

I'm talking about anabolic steroids.   

NORMAN FOST 

I'm talking about… [OVERLAPPING VOICES] …there’s a ninety 

percent chance of permanent disability.  People make that choice.  

You want to, you want to ban professional football because— 

GEORGE MICHAEL 

No, but you play within the rules, and if you get hurt, as Bob 

says, that’s an unfortunate accident.   

NORMAN FOST 

But the reason you want these rules is because you're concerned 

about the health and safety of the athletes.  Why aren't you 

against football?   

BOB COSTAS  

A question that can be posed later in the debate when the format 

actually calls for direct questions from either side of the table.  

Here, one more question to this side, and then we’ll announce the 

results of the preliminary voting by the audience.  I’ll pose it to 

Dick Pound, but again, Dale and George can respond as well.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 44. 

 

 

 

Dick, after all your years with the Olympics and with WADA, are 

you troubled by the fact that despite best efforts, the penalties are 

almost by definition disproportionate?  You catch a handful, and 

we can reasonably assume that a larger group goes free.  Marion 

Jones was never caught by Olympic testing, sophisticated as it 

was.  She was caught by the legal system.  And the same year 

that Ben Johnson was caught, others had statistical anomalies in 

their performances, and for whatever reason, they were not 

caught.  Does that trouble you?   

RICHARD POUND 

Oh, sure it does, of course it does.  Any time you see somebody 

who’s cheated and gets away with it, that's very troubling.  It’s 

one of the reasons why, why in WADA we devote, I think it’s 

about twenty-five percent of our entire budget to scientific 

research, so we can, we can find EPO, we can find HGH, we can 

find, uh, evidence of blood transfusions.  And we’re developing a 

test that is not a muscle biopsy, for genetic manipulation.  We’re 

getting a screening test that I think will be able to detect the stuff 

very unobtrusively by the time it comes on.  So yes it, of course it 

bothers us, but you don’t, you don’t go in the direction Julian’s 

suggesting, which is, you pick the lowest common denominator, 

help the guys who want to play honestly catch up with the 

cheaters, instead of bringing the cheaters back down to where, 

what they promised to do, which is not to use these things.  I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 45. 

 

 

 

think it’s a complete reversal of responsibility and approach.   

BOB COSTAS  

Dale?  George?  Anything to add?   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

Yeah, I was, I was going to say, as I said earlier, if, if I didn’t think 

we were making progress, and that this is a winnable battle, 

however long it takes, um, then I would understand giving in.  

But I, I can't, I can't comprehend just giving up.  Um, those who 

are against smoking in public have stayed with it, have stayed 

with it, and have stayed with it.  And it has worked.   And we can 

change culture, we can change the way people feel about things.  

And, and this is a battle about fighting, instead of just giving in.   

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

Here, here’s a reason to think this battle is unwinnable.  Given 

the massive prize money, and the incentives to cheat, and the low 

probability of being detected, you can win the battle if you reduce 

the prize money, but that’s not going to happen.  All you can, 

unrealistically, increase the detection rates, but you're not going 

to achieve that either.  The economic models all push this into a 

prisoner’s dilemma where people irresistibly will cheat given the 

incentives that are on offer, and the probability to—

BOB COSTAS  

Who many rich canoeists do you know?  [LAUGHTER] 

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

It’s not, it’s not— 

RICHARD POUND 

It’s just money, I agree that it’s— 

BOB COSTAS  

There’s a whole array of, a whole array of Olympic sports, 

obviously that have little or not financial reward attached to 

them.   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

Mr. Balko, let me, let me make one quick point.  You took, took 

on the horse industry, I’ve been named the top American Paint 

Horse Breeder, and the American Quarterhorse Breeder twice.  

So, I’ve had a lot of horses in my barn, a hundred and fifty at a 

time.  We’ve never used a sweat box.  Ever.  I will not allow 

steroids.  Ever.  When you talk about the horse industry, and you 

know how we get horses ready for shows or race, make it real 

general that some people do, because I would never do it.

BOB COSTAS  

All right, we’re going far afield here, so— [LAUGHTER] 

GEORGE MICHAEL 

So what?   

BOB COSTAS  

Briefly— 

GEORGE MICHAEL 

It involves steroids.   

BOB COSTAS 

Briefly Radley, and then I’ll try and get back to the format.  Go 

ahead.   

RADLEY BALKO 

I was referring to, there was a cover story on Sports, in cover, 

Sports Illustrated a couple of years ago about the lengths that 

jockeys go through to, to make weight.   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

Oh, the jockeys, OK.   

RADLEY BALKO 

Right, the jockeys, not the horses.   

BOB COSTAS  

OK.   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

You want to get back to your format?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 48. 

 

 

 

BOB COSTAS 

Yeah, we have to get back to the format because, uh, they, they 

threaten me with draconian punishments if I, uh, went too far 

afield.  So, what we do at this point, before opening it up to, uh, 

some back and forth between the panelists, and then ultimately 

to a long session of Q&A, most of it from the audience, we let you 

know the results of the initial balloting.  Now, this is before any of 

the debaters took to the podium, the proposition is, we should 

accept performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports.  

Before the debate began eighteen percent of you were for the 

motion, sixty-three percent were against, nineteen percent were 

undecided.  You’ll have a chance to vote again after the debate 

has concluded, and we’ll see if those numbers move in one 

direction or the other.  Now we’ll allow the panelists to question 

each other directly.  Norm Fost will go first, and you can ask a 

direct question of any panelist on the other side of the table.  

NORMAN FOST 

I'm going to try to squeeze in two, two questions, if I can.  Uh, I 

want to ask Dale Murphy a question.  Andy Petitte, the Yankee 

pitcher who recently, he was named in the Mitchell Report, and 

he admitted to using, um, growth hormone.  And he said the 

reason I used it was because I had injuries, the my doctor said 

my injuries could heal faster, um, which is true, that’s the way 

these things work, they let you to repair injuries faster so you can 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 49. 

 

 

 

train harder and get back on the field.  If Roger Clemens said 

that, if Ben Johnson said that, if they all said that, which they 

equally could have said, I used them because they help me heal 

faster, would that have been, are you OK with what Petitte said, 

and would you be OK with them?  And I want to ask— 

BOB COSTAS  

Let’s, let’s let him ask, answer that first, then you ask your 

second question.  Dale?   

DALE MURPHY 

Yeah, absolutely not, it’s, it’s still trying to get an advantage over 

the guys that are not taking human growth hormone to recover 

from an injury.  That’s why guys take steroids.  It’s not 

necessarily to look like Barry Bonds, but it’s to recover quicker.  

Pitchers, that’s why pitchers take them.  Um, so I think in answer 

to your question, it would not be as big a story.  Andy Petitte was 

smart.  But is it still right?  No.  It’s still not within the rules and 

the spirit of the game to take steroids or human growth hormone 

to recover from an injury quicker, because a lot of guys are 

following the rules, and they don’t get to recover faster because 

they, they kept the rules.  So it’s still wrong.  I think he had a 

good P.R. agent and lawyer to say this is how you get it off your 

back.  It doesn't make it right.   

RADLEY BALKO 

But, but we’re talking about what the rules should be, and, and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 50. 

 

 

 

I'm interested, as a former player, of your opinion, if, if it’s true, 

that the side effects of HGH are minimal, particularly when 

compared to steroids, and it does help, I mean, these are people, 

athletes are people whose livelihoods depends on, on basically 

what amounts to physical labor, right?  And if a guy can, uh, get 

back into the game quicker because of HGH, is that any different 

than a, you know, a construction worker who wants to get back 

on the job quicker because his pay check is dependent on it, 

taking something, a drug that has minimal effects that helps him 

recover quicker?   

BOB COSTAS  

Reasonable question, let me focus it a little bit.  Um, are we in a 

pass/fail mindset about the whole array of performance 

enhancing drugs, especially after the Mitchell Report, if we talk 

about baseball, where if you're in the Mitchell Report, you're 

guilty, no matter what you did, you're as guilty as the most full 

blown juicer. And should even those who were generally against 

the use of performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports, 

should they consider that possibly we’ve lumped all these drugs 

and all the circumstances under which they might be used into 

the same grouping, and we might be able to take a more nuanced 

approached, and that maybe using HGH short term to help rehab 

an injury is not the same thing as going steroids full blown and 

going from a one hundred sixty pound whippet who hits twenty

home runs to some sort of gargantuan figure who hits seventy-

three?   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

Are you referring to Barry Bonds?   

BOB COSTAS 

It was just a number.   

DALE MURPHY 

I retired, I retired— 

BOB COSTAS  

He hit seven sixty-two.   

DALE MURPHY 

I retired at, at thirty-seven, Barry Bonds hit seventy-three home 

runs at thirty-seven.  Um, you know, what, what’s the future 

hold?  I mean, it, do, does it help you heal quicker?  Yeah, that's 

why guys take them.  But do we need them?  No. You're going to 

heal a little slower.   

PANELIST 

Isn't that— 

DALE MURPHY 

I mean, you're going to, let’s, let’s stop the abuse of a controlled 

substance.  Human Growth Hormone for kids helps them grow 

when they're not producing enough of their own.  That's a 

legitimate use for it.  But for a, a pitcher to get back quicker, to 

me, in sports, you're going to get back a little later.  It’s OK.  I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 52. 

 

 

 

want to stop the abuse.  And I think to allow any of it in, for 

whatever reason, increases the odds of abuse, and increases, 

again, the kids seeing the example that they have to take this 

stuff to succeed.  It just isn't needed.  It’s not needed— 

BOB COSTAS  

In the, in the interests of time, Norm, quickly your second 

question.   

NORMAN FOST 

Well just first, as a doctor, I don’t understand what medicine’s 

about if it’s not about trying to help people recover from injuries 

and heal, and if you're— 

DALE MURPHY 

But not to hit home runs.   

NORMAN FOST 

And if you have a, if you have a drug that doesn't, has almost no 

side effects, and it helps people heal, I don’t know how it differs 

from anything else that— 

BOB COSTAS  

Your question.  

NORMAN FOST 

Second one, Dick Pound, um, a lot of the discussion here has 

been about fair competition.  Um, knowing that Janet Evans used 

a greasy swimsuit that was not available to her opponents, did 

you speak out at the time against that?  Would you speak out 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 53. 

 

 

 

against it now?  Do you think her medal should be taken back?  

And if not, why not?   

BOB COSTAS  

Dick?   

RICHARD POUND 

I, I think you’ve got a, a completely bizarre perception of the 

difference between Ben Johnson and Janet Evans.  I mean, Ben 

Johnson used a prohibited anabolic steroid.  There was a rule 

against it. There was no rule about whether you could have nylon 

swimsuits or greasy swimsuits.  

NORMAN FOST 

Do you think it was fair?   

RICHARD POUND 

I think it was, I don’t think it was, uh, I don’t think that’s the 

question here.  Did she break…  What if she practiced harder?  I 

mean, frankly, I, I greatly admire Janet Evans, I think she won 

the Olympics because she trained harder and was a better 

swimmer than everybody.  I don't think the swimsuit made any 

difference, and there’s been subsequent tests on all of these suits.   

And the International Swimming Federation said, wear whatever 

you want, it does not appreciably, if at all, effect performance.  So 

I think you, you’ve got your, your priorities really mixed up on 

that question.

BOB COSTAS  

Dick, you're right back at the microphone, because it’s your turn 

in the running order here to pose a question to the other side.   

RICHARD POUND  

Well, I was struck by something that both, um, both Radley and, 

and Norman said talking about, uh, you know, having access to 

all of this, and coercive rules.  I mean, coercive rules, you're 

talking, you make it, you make it sound like it’s three guys at the 

IOC headquarters making up all these rules.  The anti-doping 

rules are approved by two hundred plus companies, two hundred 

plus national Olympic committees, seventy-five or more 

international federations, athletes commissions from all over the 

world. It’s a consensus about what is right for sports.  And, you 

know, maybe the question to you is how come all you guys with 

these fabulous ideas aren't able to persuade two hundred 

governments and two hundred national— 

BOB COSTAS  

Two whom specifically are you directing the question?   

RICHARD POUND 

Well, I’ll address it to both, because the other is, not all of the 

athletes you're talking about will have access to a Yale medical 

doctor.  What about the athletes in Mexico?  In, in Bulgaria?  I 

mean, you— 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate

BOB COSTAS  

Norm, Radley— 

RICHARD POUND 

If you want, you want equal, you want equal playing fields, you're 

not talking the same.   

RADLEY BALKO 

Well, what about the athletes who have the funds to travel to 

Colorado Springs to train in high altitude versus low income 

athletes who might not?  Uh, you know, there, there are built-in 

advantages and disadvantages.  I think actually making a, uh, a 

cheap, a relatively cheap drug that mimics that effect, like EPO, 

which is much, much cheaper than, you know, flying an athlete 

out to Colorado to, to train at high altitude, um, actually 

democratizes, uh, that effect.  I don’t think it actually, uh, makes 

it more difficult, uh, to achieve parity.   

BOB COSTAS  

Once again, Radley, stay at the microphone, because it’s your 

turn to question the other side.  Unless Norm, you wanted to 

have a quick response?   

NORMAN FOST 

I just wanted, Dick keeps reminding us that these athletes broke 

the rules, as if we’re not all agreed about that.  I didn't know the 

debate topic was, should athlete be allowed to break the rules.  

No is the answer.  OK, that’s the end of that debate.  The 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 56. 

 

 

 

question is, why the rules are there. Why do we have a rule that 

prohibits a doctor from prescribing a drug that helps you heal 

that has no side effects?  Where did that come from?  I haven't 

heard an answer to that yet.   

BOB COSTAS  

Isn't it fair to ask whether you’ve limited the definition of why 

someone might use steroids?  It’s not so high-minded as, it helps 

you heal.  Many of the people who undertook taking steroids had 

no problems.  Their only problem was they wanted to run faster, 

grow bigger, hit more home runs.  So, there’s no medical 

indication for that, it’s performance enhancing.  That's why we 

call them performance enhancing drugs.   

NORMAN FOST 

All athletes want to get back out there and work out and get back 

on the field as soon as possible.   

BOB COSTAS  

You make it sound like they're all on the disabled list.  

[LAUGHTER]  Many of them were quite good to begin with, then 

they, they went from good to super human by using performance 

enhancing drugs.   

NORMAN FOST 

Yeah, what it, what it enables them to do is to train harder and to 

recover from injury quicker, and that’s why they get better.  Yeah.

RICHARD POUND 

I tell you what, I had an experience with medical ethicists a few 

years ago, and I, I posed a question after the panel.  I said, listen, 

let’s say I'm a track and field athlete.  Call me Ben, not a real 

name.  [LAUGHTER] And I come to you, and I say, listen, I would 

like to win the Olympics in Seoul.  I can't do this unless I use 

anabolic steroids.  There’s nothing therapeutic about this.  And I 

have to tell you that it’s totally contrary to the rules of the sport 

under which I compete.  Would you prescribe the anabolic 

steroids?  And the entire panel of medical ethicists said, of 

course.  And I said, what!?  And they said, yeah.  And I said, on 

what basis?  They said, the autonomy of the patient.  Sounds like 

Radley.

Sorry, I didn't hear what—

people to break rules.  But uh, if an athlete came, well, I’ve said 

it, if, if Ben Johnson, somebody named Ben came to me and said, 

I've got an injury, do you know anything that will help it heal, and 

it’s risk-less, and there’s no rule against it, um, I’d say, I can't 

think of any reason not to— 

BOB COSTAS  

And, and what if the person came to you and they didn't want to 

make up a story, as they might have to, and they said, I have no 

injury.  And I train like a demon.  But I’d like to have benefits on 

top of that, would you prescribe the steroids for them?   

NORMAN FOST 

Well, first of all, I'm, I'm not in sports medicine for a reason, so 

I'm, I'm not into prescribing it.  But uh, that athlete would 

misunderstand it if he thought he, the reason that stops athletes 

from working out, and why you can't lift weights eight hours a 

day and five days a week, is because you're suffering recurring 

injury.  They may not understand that.  All they know is that 

they're sore and they can't work out, and that limits their ability 

to improve their performance.   

BOB COSTAS  

So you believe the sole benefit of steroid use, we’re not talking 

about HDH, we’re talking about growth steroid use, is simply the 

ability to work out harder and recover from injury, that in and of 

themselves, they do not, on top of that, enhance performance and

allow you to do something which you could not do, if for some 

reason you could work out that hard without steroids?  

NORMAN FOST 

Bob, if you and I started taking steroids now, we’re not going to 

look like Dale Murphy anytime soon— 

BOB COSTAS  

Of course not— 

NORMAN FOST 

Or Barry Bonds.  Uh— 

BOB COSTAS  

You, you can't, you can't win the Indy 500 in a Honda either, but 

if you have… [LAUGHTER]  But if you have Indy, if you have two 

Indy cars, and one gets auto fuel and the other gets rocket fuel, 

you might have a different outcome.   

NORMAN FOST 

As best we know, the, the main way they work is by enabling you 

to work out harder.  Steroids without working out are not going to 

really change anything very much.  They do increase your 

aggressiveness, which also makes you, helps you to work out 

harder, so they have a psychological effect.  But I think it’s all 

tied to working out.   

BOB COSTAS  

All right, against the rules, I briefly became part of the debate— 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

GEORGE MICHAEL 

No!   

BOB COSTAS  

I’ll slap myself on the hand and turn it over to Radley to ask a 

question of the other side.   

RADLEY BALKO 

Sure, my, uh, question is directed at George.  Um, let’s say for the 

sake of argument that the, the names that you mentioned during 

your presentation did die directly as a result of their using 

steroids.  Uh, during alcohol prohibition people drank alcohol 

that was, uh, wood alcohol, uh, they drank alcohol that was, gin 

that was distilled in bathtubs, toxic, nasty, nasty stuff.  The 

reason they drank is because safer, cheaper, um, better 

alternatives weren't available at the time.  Uh, once prohibition 

ended, you know, nobody drinks bathtub gin anymore.  Uh, 

nobody drinks wood alcohol anymore.  Um, assuming that all 

these deaths were tied to steroids, all these deaths occurred 

during a period where steroids were illegal, and were still 

prohibited.  So, they were prohibited its entire time, people were 

doing them anyway, why not lift that veil, let people who are going 

to do it anyway get steroids from, from a doctor, get steroids from 

more reputable distributors so they don’t have to go to Tijuana.  

Maybe it wasn’t steroids itself that killed them, maybe it was the 

fact that it was some black market steroids that they weren't 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 61. 

 

 

 

being, um, advised by a reputable doctor.   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

You're absolutely correct, and maybe, you know, if they were 

controlled better, maybe Lyle Alzado wouldn't have died.  Maybe 

Ken Caminiti, who got most of his from Tijuana, wouldn't have 

died.  But what about the tight end I talked to a couple of weeks 

ago who admitted that he gained sixty pounds, this guy is only 

thirty-eight years old, gained sixty pounds, beat up his wife, went 

to his coach and said, coach help me, I'm doing the juice, but 

God, I beat up so and so. I know these people.  He didn't get his 

from Mexico.  Now, I don’t know where he got them.  But if, the, if 

you, if you allow one, if Bob can do steroids, if we’re playing side 

by side, he hits two thirty, I hit two thirty, we both move up to the 

next level.  If he’s allowed to do juice, when I sit back to sitting on 

the bench in St. Louis, I’d have done juice.  So that, so whether 

it’s legal or illegal is, is immaterial.  If we make it legal the 

problem is only going to become worse.  In relationship to alcohol, 

I don’t happen to drink, so I'm not a good one to discuss it with.   

RADLEY BALKO 

Well, I guess my point is, if we’re talking about the safety of 

athletes, isn't it better to have this all happening above ground 

and in the open air— 

GEORGE MICHAEL 

No, it’s better to have it, if you use it, you're out of baseball.  It

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate

should be a very strong penalty.  Nothing, Pete Rose, one thing 

about the, Dick made the point earlier, and Dale followed up, 

they know that if you gamble, you're dead.  So that’s the way it 

should be with steroids, unless the doctor says, you know what, 

I'm going to go to the commissioner and say, Dale needs to have 

this, so he’ll be able to come back.  Then I accept that.   

BOB COSTAS  

Dale, your question for the other side of the debate?   

DALE MURPHY 

OK, um, Dr. Fost, you mentioned the increased, uh, intensity of 

workouts of those on steroids.  Would you consider that “’Roid 

Rage?”   

NORMAN FOST  

 “’Roid Rage” as I understand it refers to people who do criminal 

things, that is who assault people or— 

DALE MURPHY 

OK, but is “’Roid Rage,” quote, unquote, without getting into the 

technicalities of what “’Roid Rage” means, isn't that one of the 

side effects of taking anabolic steroids?   

NORMAN FOST 

You become more aggressive when you take steroids, and that is 

one part of why I think some athletes feel they can work out 

harder, they sort of get more aggressive.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 63. 

 

 

 

DALE MURPHY 

They, so is it psychological, or is it a brain chemistry thing?  It’s 

totally psychological?   

NORMAN FOST 

I think there is a psychological effect, right, that impels them to 

train harder.   

DALE MURPHY 

So, when you increase the testosterone, and, and you increase 

your intensity, um, isn't that, that is a, an effect, you're saying?  

That, it will effect you that way?   

NORMAN FOST 

Sure, sure.  

DALE MURPHY 

And also are you saying that HGH, the only thing it does is help 

you heal faster?  

NORMAN FOST 

No, it has many— 

DALE MURPHY  

Do you think these guys, in other words, do you think guys took 

HGH for other reasons other than healing faster?   

NORMAN FOST 

Well, they took it so they could get back on the field sooner, could 

body build better, could lift weights, could train more vigorously, 

all of which enhanced their muscle mass.  That’s the ultimate 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate

goal, is to become stronger.   

DALE MURPHY 

OK.  

BOB COSTAS  

Decreases fat and, and increase muscle mass.  

NORMAN FOST 

Right.   

DALE MURPHY 

So, so the ability to recover faster and work out harder and gain 

muscle mass, steroids does help muscle mass product, 

productivity?   

NORMAN FOST 

Combined with working out, yeah.   

DALE MURPHY 

And if I don’t want to do that, are you saying in the future, if the 

motion is accepted, that essentially, I am at a tremendously 

unfair advantage if I decide that I do not want to take this stuff?   

NORMAN FOST 

I don’t know about tremendously unfair, I think that— 

DALE MURPHY 

Well, I would, I would say tremendously unfair.  

NORMAN FOST 

Well I don’t—

DALE MURPHY 

I mean, we can look at numbers, we can look at performances, 

um— 

NORMAN FOST 

Dale, you're exhibit A, I mean, I'm assuming you didn't use any of 

these drugs, and you're an All-Star, and uh, you know, one of the 

great players of— 

DALE MURPHY 

Well doesn't, then doesn't that make my point?  

NORMAN FOST 

You didn't seem to be at very much of an un-, of a disadvantage?   

DALE MURPHY 

But doesn't that make my point that we don’t need them?  

NORMAN FOST 

There’s all sorts of reasons— 

DALE MURPHY 

Why, why do we need them if, if people are able to perform at the 

highest level without them, and that it also provides a huge 

advantage if you use them, but you can still be a world class 

athlete, why would we need them?  Why not ban them and, and 

change the culture to the point to where guys think a lot time 

before they take this stuff?  Why do we need them?   

NORMAN FOST 

Well we don’t, we don’t need them, and we don’t need sports

either.  We don’t need tackle in football, we can play two hand 

touch, it’s just— 

DALE MURPHY 

Yeah, but we’re not talking about— 

NORMAN FOST 

It’s just not as much interest.  

DALE MURPHY 

We’re not talking about football, the people that die, that’s not the 

argument.  The argument isn't the inherent risks of any sports 

tonight, it’s performance enhancing drugs.  You don't need them 

to be a, a world class athlete.  You do not need them.  And if you 

don’t take them, you're at a huge advantage.  And so I, I just, I 

cannot understand it.  Wouldn't you agree, one last question, 

that the example that the young people see, wouldn't you say that 

abuse of these kind of drugs is particularly, we talk about side 

effects, wouldn't you agree that it’s particularly, um, harmful to 

young people, that we may not even know abuse of these kind of 

drugs— 

BOB COSTAS  

Again, let me— 

DALE MURPHY 

…what may happen.  

BOB COSTAS  

Let me slightly redirect it, would you agree, Dr. Fost, with 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 67. 

 

 

 

superior medical knowledge, would you agree that there are risks 

for adolescents that are not present, at least to the same degree, 

and you might argue at all, for adults?   

NORMAN FOST 

Absolutely, and I said in my remarks that I thought they should 

be banned in children, there should be testing in children, there 

ought to be— 

BOB COSTAS  

All right.  

NORMAN FOST 

…harsh penalties for suppliers to children— 

BOB COSTAS  

If that’s the case then, isn't it inevitable, if you were to allow 

unfettered access to performance enhancing drugs beyond a 

certain threshold of competition and a certain age limit, that 

those who aspire to play at the collegiate level, and ultimately to 

play at the professional level, wouldn't just be influenced, they’d 

be nearly compelled to begin using sooner than you would 

advocate— 

NORMAN FOST 

No— 

BOB COSTAS  

…to get there?  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 68. 

 

 

 

NORMAN FOST 

[LAUGHS]  I don’t think so.  First of all they couldn't, wouldn't be 

able to get them through prescribed channels, they wouldn't be 

able to get them through illegal channels— 

BOB COSTAS  

Plenty of people get them now— 

NORMAN FOST 

And that’s why we need rigorous testing and criminal penalties 

for those who do it.  Look, I'm much, it’s interesting how we 

obsess about this issue, which again, has caused very little 

serious harm to adolescents, and the ones who do use them, as 

Julian said, are using them mainly to bodybuild, not, they're not 

being used, for the most part, in uh, competitive sports.  Most of 

the adolescent use is in the gyms, not in the playing field. But 

listen, alcohol kills fifty thousand people a year, and what are the 

big leagues doing about that.  When players drink, I don't hear 

anybody talking about lifetime bans for drunk driving by baseball 

players.  That kills fifty thousand people a year, including 

innocent victims, including a lot of kids, and here we are talking 

about something that kills almost nobody.  Chewing tobacco is a 

big problem among youth in this country, and we have the 

networks showing Terry Francona drooling every ten seconds 

during the World Series.  What kind of— 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 69. 

 

 

 

BOB COSTAS  

Although they have banned it in the minors, and they would ban 

it at the Major League Level if they could unilaterally impose it.  

But they can't— 

NORMAN FOST 

And most seriously of all is the violence by professional athletes.  

I'm talking about sexual assault, and criminal violence, rampant 

in professional sports.  No lifetime penalty, no ban, do a little 

community service, and come back.  What message does that 

send— 

BOB COSTAS  

Is, isn't that why, to uh, the side of the table that is against the 

motion, isn't that why the argument against the use of 

performance enhancing drugs is best focused on competitive 

issues, the sanctity of the records, uh, the level playing field 

argument.  And if we start moralizing about health dangers, or 

relative impact on society, then you run up against all the 

arguments that Dr. Fost just laid out, and isn't the best argument 

for this side of the table the argument about competitive balance, 

or competitive fairness?   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

True, but Doctor, remember what Dr. James Andrews said, that 

is we have more torn muscles, we have more pulled muscles 

because we have too much muscle mass for the body, and that’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 70. 

 

 

 

the direct result of steroids and the workouts with steroids.   

BOB COSTAS  

Very briefly.   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

That, that’s the best man.   

RICHARD POUND 

I find, I mean, one of the things here are like the guy who’s pulled 

over on the highway by the, by the policeman saying, but, but 

officer, why are you stopping me, there are all kinds of people 

going faster than I was?  But to, to deal with the, the young 

people, I mean, you're familiar with, with the state imposed 

doping programs in East Germany and some of those, and the 

medical data arising from that.  Clearly there are health impacts, 

adverse health impacts on the athletes— 

NORMAN FOST 

Yeah, those were horrible, and that was close to coercion, and, as 

I said, the side effects in kids are sufficient to have very rigorous 

penalties against those who do that sort of thing.   

BOB COSTAS  

Julian, your question.   

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

OK, so on the topic of children, it’s a major plank in your 

argument.  Dale Murphy said it would send the wrong message to 

children, and, and Dick Pound said, uh, you didn't want your 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 71. 

 

 

 

children or anyone else’s children becoming chemical stockpiles.  

So, the argument, as I understand it here, is we need to ban 

performance enhancing drugs in adults to protect our children.  

So, my question to Dick Pound is, don’t we have, already in 

society, different rules and laws for children and adults, so on 

your argument, um, we should ban everyone from driving 

motorcars, because some children may illegally drive them and 

kill themselves.  So, my question to you is, do you think we also 

should ban driving cars in adults because it might be abused by 

some children?   

PANELIST 

Well, or using alcohol.   

RICHARD POUND 

Isn't, isn't that a silly question?   

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

That, that’s the, why, why do we accept the rules— 

[OVERLAPPING VOICES]  

RADLEY BALKO

RICHARD POUND  

No, no, no.  I mean, the issue, the issue…  

[OVERLAPPING VOICES]  

RADLEY BALKO 

…what’s the difference?   

RICHARD POUND 

Because the community at large, sport is not going to solve every 

problem on the face of the planet, even though we come to affairs 

like this and like to pretend it can.  Uh, but the community, 

governments, National Olympic Committee, Sports Federations, 

the public at large say, here are things that you should not take, 

and there’s a reason for them.  They're, they're either, they're 

performance enhancing, they’re risk to health, or they're contrary 

to a defined term, not a pornographic definition, uh, called Spirit 

of Sport.  And you, you examine every, um, substance or method 

against that matrix, and if it meets two of the three criteria, then 

chances are it may be on the list.  There’s a good reason for it.  It 

may be wrong.  Maybe somebody’s got the science wrong.  Maybe 

they do.  Nobody’s perfect.  And science goes on.  But, in the 

meantime, that’s the community, and that’s the values that, that 

are reflected in, in the community.   

BOB COSTAS  

All right, we are running behind on time, and I will take some of 

the blame for that.  George Michael, last question, and then we’ll

open it up to the audience, and we’ll try and pick up the pace.  

George?   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

I’ll just make it real quick.  Doctor, you said that only six percent 

of the tests came back positive?   

NORMAN FOST 

In that year, that first year of universal testing.   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

Let me just say this.  Bob, you’ve got to back me up, I only have 

one statement.   

BOB COSTAS  

Yeah?   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

It was the single worst drug testing in the history of sports period.  

Don’t ever refer to that six percent— 

BOB COSTAS  

If you, if you failed, if you failed that test— 

GEORGE MICHAEL 

That was a disgrace, an American disgrace.  

BOB COSTAS  

…then you failed an I.Q. test simultaneously.  [LAUGHTER]  No—

…that an announced test that didn't, that didn't test for all, a 

whole array of designer steroids, and still showed somehow six or 

seven percent failing, no one thinks that’s the limit of it.  In fact, 

you could reasonably… [OVERLAPPING VOICES] …many 

multiples beyond that—

hearings.  What is its technical legitimacy in doing that, and 

philosophically do you think it’s any of their business or not—

any of Congress’s business to be involved as they have been,

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 76. 

 

 

 

RADLEY BALKO 

You—you can probably guess my answer, um…uh, just a very, 

very quick anecdote, when baseball first objected to the, the, uh, 

Congress’s jurisdiction to look into this matter, uh, Congressman 

Davis and Congressman Waxman sent a letter back to baseball, 

stating that Cong—their, their particular committee, the 

Government Reform Committee, had jurisdiction over any matter 

at any time.   Uh, this is the, the sort of arrogance of Congress, 

they think that there’s nothing that they don’t have authority, uh, 

and jurisdiction over.  Um, I, I…people  are gonna say that, uh, 

the baseball anti-trust exemption, uh, somehow means that they, 

they have to sort of bend to the will of Congress.   Uh, I would 

submit that if, if that’s your argument, then, everybody who gets 

a government benefit, uh, sort of throws, uh, all of their rights 

out the window from student loan recipients to, uh, public 

housing recipients to, you know, corporate subsidies, so—  Uh, I, 

yeah, I, I don’t think this is an issue of Congress, I think baseball 

can determine what its rules ought to be, uh, on its own.   

BOB COSTAS  

On the other hand, uh, even though there may have been plenty 

of grandstanding involved, you can’t deny that there was 

movement after Congress first, uh, convened hearings in 2005.  It 

was, it was a perfect storm, there was Canseco’s book, BALCO 

was breaking, and the Congressional hearings were part of it, but 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 77. 

 

 

 

it seemed to move the issue along.   

RADLEY BALKO 

Oh, absolutely it did, and we—whether, whether or not that’s a 

good thing or bad thing that individual Congressmen can force an 

entire industry to sort of bend to their will, uh, I, I, I happen to 

find that troubling.   

NORMAN FOST 

And I, I have to say there’s something fishy going on, when the 

Congress holds hearings and the President takes time in a State 

of the Union address told about the horrors of steroids, which as 

far as I know haven’t killed any kids yet this year or not very 

many—   

DALE MURPHY 

Yes.    

NORMAN FOST 

And, and smok—and smoking, George, will kills 400,000 people 

every year, 400,000, 90 percent of whom start smoking in 

childhood,  but this is not worthy of Congressional hearings or 30 

seconds of the State of the Union address—   

BOB COSTAS  

Well, the—the nation lacks an effective steroid lobby…  

[APPLAUSE]  Unlike the tobacco lobby—  

NORMAN FOST

BOB COSTAS 

They don’t have an effective steroid lobby.   

NORMAN FOST 

There’s something going on other than deep concern for the well-

being of children.  

BOB COSTAS 

Congress’s involvement.  Dale maybe, what do you think?    

DALE MURPHY 

Well, I, uh…I think, uh, it’s been helpful, I think though what we 

will find is that the Mitchell Report will—something that was done 

internally, will be of most help, uh, to this problem.  Um, I think 

it’ll be a catalyst for us to make some progress.  But I, I gotta say, 

if the argument is smoking or alcohol or prohibition or lasik 

surgery, that’s not what it says up there.  [LAUGHS]  It says 

should we allow performance-enhancing drugs, I still don’t see 

the correlation between bringing in the problems with alcohol 

which are real, I would love to next year to come back and 

discuss whether baseball should, uh, get rid of all their beer 

sponsors.   I would be in favor of that, but that’s not the question 

tonight.  There, there—it is a relatively small problem, totally 

agree with that.  But that’s just not the question tonight.

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I always thought that competitive sports meant a natural 

competition, a motivation, an incentive, a desire to want to be the 

very best.  That’s what we always teach our kids no matter what 

it is that we do—what they wanna do in life.  And it seems to me, 

that by taking any kind of a performance-enhancing anything, 

you are taking away the naturalness of wanting to achieve.   Of 

wanting to be the best, of wanting to grow.  It says just pump me 

up, and you have a good business thing here, and put me out.

BOB COSTAS 

Dr. Fost, a brief response—   

NORMAN FOST 

Like Carnac I can answer the question without even knowing the 

question.  [LAUGHTER]

BOB COSTAS 

Place—place an envelope to your forehead when doing so in that 

case.   

NORMAN FOST 

Um, that’s a nice notion about sports and it’s certainly what we 

ought to promote for our kids but it hasn’t been what sports has 

been about at an elite level for 7,000 years and that’s why I 

mentioned the Babylonians,  if you took the steroids and the 

growth hormone away, what you would have is literally a 

thousand other things that athletes do to enhance their 

performance, none of them natural.  Uh, athletes drink Gatorade 

from a factory, they take pasta to carbo-load that’s made from a 

factory.   Uh, they don’t eat potatoes out of the ground to carbo-

load, they put on fancy shoes, they train at altitude, they do 

everything—   

RICHARD POUND 

Can I interrupt, Doctor—  [LAUGHS]   

NORMAN FOST 

—there a—there’s no athlete since the beginning of time, who 

competed naturally to win a race.    

RICHARD POUND 

Doctor, I gotta interrupt.  You’re comparing drinking Gatorade to 

taking anabolic steroids?

NORMAN FOST 

No, I’m not, I’m just saying that—   

RICHARD POUND 

What are you—well then why bring it up, it, it’s—   

NORMAN FOST 

It’s really what she bring—she said, it should be just about 

nature, just, people on—by their own natural ability, I don’t know 

a single athlete who relies on his or her own natural ability to 

compete.   

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

Do—do you think a hypoxic air tent is natural?  Is that a—is that 

a—a hypoxic air tent.  This is what all US athletes use to, to boost 

their—   

RICHARD POUND 

Well, my understanding is the reason they do it is to level the 

playing field with those that live at high altitude, which, this 

training is readily accessible and, and permissible.   

NORMAN FOST 

But not—   

RICHARD POUND 

Performance-enhancing drugs are not permissible.   

BOB COSTAS 

To the audience—   



Media Transcripts, Inc.

RICHARD POUND 

So—    

BOB COSTAS  

To the audience, yes.  Yes, ma’am.   

SARAH SCHORNO 

I’m Sara Schorno with the Huffington Post.  And this question is 

more for those against the notion, um, maybe particularly Mr. 

Pound.  Setting the legalities aside and the fact that it’s against 

the rules, um, what difference do you see if any between an 

athlete using performance enhancers to stay in the game and say 

an actress using injections and cosmetic surgery to stay in the 

movies?   

RICHARD POUND 

Be—because what we’ve agreed…in sport—   

SARAH SCHORNO 

But setting the rules aside is what I’m saying, I mean you 

mentioned a lot of ethics, and you mentioned a lot of unfair 

advantages.  So using those two examples that you’ve used, what 

do you see the difference is.    

RICHARD POUND 

Well, you, you have to have rules in order to have sport.  You, you 

can’t have sport without rules, it’s not, uh, it’s not, you know, the 

only, the world’s shortest rulebook I know is Australian-rules 

football.  You know.  “Get ball to end,” and, and, uh—  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 83. 

 

 

 

[LAUGHTER]   So I, I don’t think you can compare that.  We’re 

talking about sport.  What, what—  

SARAH SCHORNO 

No, no, I understand—   

RICHARD POUND 

—[UNCLEAR] actresses do—    

SARAH SCHORNO 

—I understand sport, but, one of the arguments that you’ve used 

is the ethics of it.  Um, that it’s against the rules because it’s 

unethical and because it’s unfair—    

RICHARD POUND 

No, no, no, that’s, it’s backwards.  It’s unethical because you 

have agreed to the performance of a, a particular skill in a 

particular way, and you’ve broken that promise.  You’ve cheated 

on your fellow competitor, that’s what’s unethical.   

SARAH SCHORNO 

So then do you think that if it were to be accepted in sports that 

it would then still be unethical, or if they did allow steroids within 

sports would it then be ethical to use them.   

RICHARD POUND 

It would not be unethical to use them.  That’s right.  No, no, it’s, 

it’s the rule.   

BOB COSTAS 

Couple more quick  questions.  Limit—we know—now all the

hands are going up, but we don’t have time for everybody so, 

whom have the fine folks out there decided—yes.   

JON FRANKEL 

Uh, Jon Frankel, HBO’s “Real Sports.”  Um, first thing is your, 

your statistic of 90 percent permanent disability in the NFL is 

way off and I’ve done pieces criticizing the NFL so it’s not fair to 

invoke that specific—   

NORMAN FOST 

What—what is the right number.   

JON FRANKEL 

Well, there’s—there is no real number, there’s, there’s no way to 

know what permanent disability is and that’s been one of the 

long-running arguments—   

BOB COSTAS 

How are you defining permanent disability, Dr. Fost.    

NORMAN FOST 

I was just quoting a New York Times study of, uh, people who 

had—weren’t able to perform  activities of daily living, um, I think  

was the definition, but I don’t remember precisely.   

BOB COSTAS 

Jon—   

NORMAN FOST 

But if you have a different number I’d like to know what it is.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 85. 

 

 

 

JON FRANKEL 

Well, what I really would like to get at is you, you are talking 

about the fact that there are no, or minimal side effects when it 

comes to steroids and you’re comparing adults versus youth.  

Um, I haven’t turned on a television and seen a commercial for, 

um, some sort of medicine that doesn’t spend half its time telling 

us about the side effects, so I’m—I dare find it hard to believe that 

steroids don’t have some side effects that don’t have serious 

health implications.   Um, you all on this side of the panel for the 

motion, seem to suggest that, any advantage, whether it’s 

drinking caffeine or such is a good advantage, so it is worth 

doing.   So, I wonder whether you advocate insider trading, 

um…uh, in that, in that way, because it clearly gives us an 

advantage.  My other point is to the kids, and it’s been brought 

up by the side against the motion and that is, why should my 

son, who at eight years old, who already watches Barry Bonds, 

when he gets to the high school level, and there’s a kid who plays 

second base, who’s—he knows is taking something,  and all he 

wants to do is play second base on his high school baseball team, 

he may not even wanna make it to college or to the pros.  He just 

wants to play at the high school level.  Inevitably he’s gonna be 

faced with that decision of, should I take, or should I not.   

BOB COSTAS  

All right.  Are all advantages positive advantages, and what about 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 86. 

 

 

 

the scenario that Jon Frankel just laid out, who wants to 

respond, Radley—   

RADLEY BALKO 

I’ll take the first part if, if you wanna take the second, um, I—  

Look, I don’t know what advantages are harmful  and what 

advantages are helpful, I mean my, my position on this is that, 

part of the problem is, is what we don’t know, uh, because 

everything is, is, is black market and is, and it is under this veil.  

Uh, I think my point is that we need to lift that veil and, and trust 

adults to make their own decisions about what risks they’re going 

to take.   

BOB COSTAS 

Norm?   

NORMAN FOST 

I think your son, uh, should, we should do everything we can to 

stop him from smoking, from drinking, from using steroids, and 

other things that are harmful and that he is not in a position to 

make informed choices, so I’m in favor of whatever we can 

reasonably do, to prohibit it, make it illegal, make it criminal, to 

test, to use kids as indicators for these activities when they’re 

occurring, so I’m completely sympathetic to your concern, and I 

think we should do everything we can to stop it.    

BOB COSTAS  

We apologize to all those audience members who had good 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 87. 

 

 

 

questions of their own but because of time we have to move on to 

the summation portion but before we do that let me pose a 

question to this side of the table.  It’s often tossed out, well, 

people use various medications for this reason or that, or, uh, the 

woman from the Huffington Post used the example of an actress 

who might resort to plastic surgery as she ages, other 

performance enhancers of various kinds.   But isn’t that a 

specious argument because, there is no objective competition for 

who has the fewest wrinkles.  And if, and I don’t mean to be 

flippant, but if there were some kind of competition, that people 

cared about, and that people entered into in good faith,  and that 

had an ongoing history that people cared about, and that 

competition entailed how frequently and with what level of, uh, of 

effectiveness one could perform sexually, then perhaps you 

might,  you might have to put in rules against the use of Viagra, 

one com—competitor to another.  But that doesn’t apply, that 

doesn’t apply to the use, or the suggested use of Viagra, it doesn’t 

apply to the suggested use of plastic surgery.  In competitive 

sports, which are, which are conducted with a structure and with 

objective rules and goals, it seems to me that whatever anyone 

uses for performance enhancement of one kind or another, 

outside those spheres, isn’t analogous.  Response? 

RADLEY BALKO 

No, I agree, I mean we’re—but, but we keep going back to the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 88. 

 

 

 

rules here and, none of us is advocating breaking the rules, uh, I 

mean the purpose of this debate tonight is to deter—we’re 

debating what those rules ought to be.   Uh, I’m not saying that 

once you enter into an agreement with a league that says you will 

not use these—this list of substances, I’m not defending people 

who then go and use those substances, I mean that—that’s fraud 

basically.  Um, what we’re debating here is what those rules 

ought to be—   

BOB COSTAS  

But you would agree that what is used outside competitive sports 

and taken for granted in society, really is not a persuasive 

argument for what should be allowed within competitive sports.  

You have to make a different argument and maybe there’s a good 

one but that isn’t it.   

RADLEY BALKO 

Uh, I think it’s a different argument to say that because we use 

liposuction or, or get, uh, Botox injections, that that’s the same 

as, uh, uh, entering into an agreement, uh, to, to, to have a 

competition, uh, under, under set guidelines—   

BOB COSTAS  

Yeah, if there were a flat-abs competition and one guy had to do 

sit-ups and someone else got liposuction, it wouldn’t be a fair 

competition, if anyone cared about that competition.    



Media Transcripts, Inc.

RADLEY BALKO 

Absolutely, if it—if you’re having a beauty contest and the, and 

the judge—and the, the criteria is natural beauty and someone 

went out and got breast implants, uh, and won the competition—  

BOB COSTAS  

Right.   

RADLEY BALKO 

—I, I, I would object to that,  yes.    

BOB COSTAS  

All right, it is time now…on that uplifting note, uh, [LAUGHTER]  

for our, for our summation.  And, and here is the order of debater 

presentation, it begins with Dick Pound.  Two minutes.   

RICHARD POUND 

Thank you, I think that, that out of the mouths of the other side 

you’ve heard, um, all kinds of reasons why this, uh…motion 

should be voted on in our, uh, direction.  Human nature is not 

gonna change.  Um, the—we’ve heard from a number of the, uh, 

other, uh, the other opponents talking about, there would be 

ongoing development of these things, without care for safety.   In, 

in the cat-and-mouse game of trying to improve what’s out there, 

there would be no care for safety, so that if you have a doctor 

prescribing 10 cc’s of…anabolic steroid, uh, and everybody’s 

doing that, then there’s no more advantage.  So the person who 

wants the advantage is gonna use 20, or 30, or 40.   And that will

be pursued, uh, as will the, the sort of, uh, research in that 

area—  We had Kelly White, uh, American sprinter, come to the 

World Anti-Doping Agency after she got caught in the BALCO 

situation.  They were giving her the clear THG.   She said she was 

having two enormous menstrual cycles every month, and she had 

blood pressure that was going right to the roof, and she went to 

Conte and the others and said, uh, this is happening, he said oh, 

huh.  Well, maybe you should take a little less and, and, oh, and 

drink some more water.   They had no idea…the stuff was going 

from a laboratory bench into her system.  And, and the system of 

other athletes.  Uh, excellence within sport is what everyone 

searches for, but it’s excellence within agreed rules.  And, and the 

community speaks.  That, that—    

BOB COSTAS 

30 seconds, Dick.   

RICHARD POUND 

30?   

BOB COSTAS 

30.   

RICHARD POUND 

The community has spoken, I think the community has a 

legitimate interest in things that may be a health interest.  You 

know, what happens in the major league influences triple-A, 

double-A, single-A, high school ball.  There are pyramids in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 91. 

 

 

 

hockey and basketball.   This is a public-health problem.  And 

finally I thought, um, one point made by, by Dr. Fost was, was 

quite telling.  He said, more or less, that alcohol—in response to 

this gentleman’s question, alcohol, tobacco, steroids, and other 

dangerous things should be discouraged.  And I agree with him 

entirely.    

BOB COSTAS  

Now his summation for the motion, Norm Fost.   

NORMAN FOST 

Uh, every person on this panel agrees that people should play by 

the rules, and there isn’t anyone up here who has defended 

breaking the rules.  The topic that’s here for debate tonight is, 

what are the basis of those rules.  If there was a rule prohibiting 

people playing with red hair, we would say of course if you have 

read hair you can’t play.   But we wouldn’t say that that was a 

sensible rule.  So rules have to have some moral basis or some 

rational basis.  The fact that they simply are there doesn’t tell us 

anything about the basis of them.  When we look at what the 

claims for them are, they seem hypocritical, inconsistent, or 

based on bad facts.   People say they’re based on concerns about 

fair competition, but sports allow grossly unfair competition, 

Olympic sports, countries against countries, baseball, Yankees 

against Brewers, the leagues tolerate unfair competition, so I 

simply don’t believe them when they say they’re passionately 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 92. 

 

 

 

concerned about fair competition.  They say they’re concerned 

about harm.  When the president of the—   

BOB COSTAS 

One minute—   

NORMAN FOST 

—National Hockey League, says that he’s— has screening for 

drugs because he’s concerned about the safety and health of the 

athletes, and there’s no laughter in the press room, you have to 

really wonder about what’s going on.   Uh, if you have good 

arguments you don’t make up things.  We have Lyle Alzado being 

rolled out again tonight, three times.  There’s not a doctor in 

America who knows anything about steroids and cancer who 

thinks Lyle Alzado’s tumor had anything to do with steroids.   

There’s not another steroid user ever who had the kind of cancer 

he had.  So if the headline had said “Lyle Alzado, Alcohol User, 

Has Brain Cancer,” I guess we’d be talking about alcohol causing 

brain cancer.   

BOB COSTAS 

20 seconds.    

NORMAN FOST 

So the need to roll out misinformation over and over again 

suggests there’s not much going on the other side.  Thank you.   

BOB COSTAS 

And now speaking against the motion in summation, Dale 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 93. 

 

 

 

Murphy.    

DALE MURPHY 

Well, um, tonight was—it—the, the motion is about performance-

enhancing drugs, should they be allowed in sports, I agree with, 

uh, what has been said, that it wasn’t about breaking the rules.  

But I’ve also heard performance-enhancing drugs tonight 

compared to your morning latte, uh, to lasik eye surgery, maybe 

we should not allow glasses, or a contact lens.   Uh, but that is 

not the question, if the question was about alcohol abuse, again, I 

think  we would all love to come back and talk about that.  But 

performance-enhancing drugs is the issue, and to me, this, no 

matter how long it takes, this is a, a, a battle worth fighting.   

Um, what happens if I’m a major league baseball player under a 

doctor’s supervision, he tests me, looks at me, looks at my blood 

pressure, looks at all the factors and decides, you know, Dale, I 

don’t think you are gonna be on our guinea pigs as Dr. Fost, um, 

uh, intimated that we, we could use major league baseball 

players for if we—  

BOB COSTAS 

One minute.    

DALE MURPHY 

—if we let this go.  Because your blood pressure is, you know, I 

know you’re trying to have kids, we don’t wanna boost your 

testosterone.  Um, it—I—if, if, if it is generally acceptable to use 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 94. 

 

 

 

these things in my sport, but I can’t use ‘em or choose not to, I 

am at, at totally unfair, um, disadvantage.   Speaking of the 

Yankees, and that they have more money than anybody else.  Dr. 

Fost must’ve not been following the Yankees during the ‘80s.  

When they had more money than anybody else.  If, if somebody 

with a lot more money than George Steinbrenner wants to buy 

the Yankees, again, that is fair competition, you can spend your 

own money, um, but it doesn’t guarantee success.   Again, 

performance-enhancing drugs somehow was linked to the fact 

that the Yankees have an unfair advantage because they have a 

higher payroll.  Again, the two don’t compare, that’s what we’re 

discussing tonight, and—  

BOB COSTAS 

Time to wrap up.   

DALE MURPHY 

And, um, to me, again, uh…Julian mentioned a zero-tolerance 

rule, that it’s confusing and we don’t know what’s out there.  In 

baseball there is not a zero-tolerance rule.  I wish there was, I 

think we would make great strides.  In the—and again, in 

comparing that to the zero-tolerance—  

BOB COSTAS 

Time.    

DALE MURPHY 

—rule we have, on gambling on baseball.  We can make progress

BOB COSTAS 

Radley Balko.   

RADLEY BALKO 

Um— I—I’ve been really disturbed over the last month, listening 

to sports talk radio over…the—   

BOB COSTAS 

It’s generally disturbing, Radley.    

RADLEY BALKO 

Yeah.  Well there—there’s been a, a certain amount of glee and 

kind of a “gotcha” mentality to, to the Marion Jones situation 

and, uh, you know…I find it troubling that a woman is—a young 

woman is being pulled away from her kids, uh, and put in jail, 

uh, for six months leaving her kids without a mother, uh, for that 

time, over, uh, you know, a, a decision she made about her own 

health knowing the risks involved.   Now granted she broke the 

rules.  But, we’re in a…sort of a feeding frenzy about this at this 

point and it’s a, it’s a common tactic or it’s a common 

phenomenon, uh, when drug issues hit the media, uh, things 

tend to spin off into a moral panic.  And, we sort of saw it tonight 

from our opponents, I mean the question tonight, the entire time 

is what should the rules governing sports be.  And, a commoner 

frame particularly for Mr. Pound was that, well, we shouldn’t 

allow—

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 96. 

 

 

 

BOB COSTAS 

One minute.   

RADLEY BALKO 

—performance-enhancing drugs in sports because the rules say 

we shouldn’t allow them.  Um, and I guess what I’m hoping you’ll 

take away from this after listening to our side of this is that 

maybe, every now and then we should sort of take a step back 

and examine whether the rules themselves are moral and are 

justified.  

BOB COSTAS 

And some applause for Radley for actually using up only a 

minute and 120 seconds, Wow.  that was good.  All right.  

[APPLAUSE]  Speaking against the motion.  And summarizing his 

viewpoint, George Michael.   

GEORGE MICHAEL 

The mother went to jail because Mom cheated, not with steroids, 

but it was a check-cashing scheme, and people like interviewed 

her a lot, before she ever became a star.  And I bought in and 

believed everything she said when she said she didn’t use.  I 

believed her.   So that’s maybe why you might hear a little glee.

GEORGE MICHAEL 

—a kid wanted to play—   

BOB COSTAS 

His cousin—    

GEORGE MICHAEL 

Hey.  Wanted to play baseball.  He was good, not great.  But he 

found out, someone told him, he’s 19 years old, he was told use 

steroids, and you’re gonna be good enough.  You’ve got everything 

you need, just need some more power.  So he starts using 

steroids and he becomes good.   This is not make-believe, this is 

real.  Efrain Marrero, 19 years old, his parents found out, and 

like good responsible parents Dad said, get off that stuff, because 

he was starting to get a little nutso.  Get off that stuff or you can 

never play another baseball game.  He obeyed his parents.

bedroom and he blew his brains out.  But there’s no evidence, 

that it was steroids that did it.  Time up.    

BOB COSTAS  

Actually breaking Radley’s record by seven seconds.  

[LAUGHTER]  And the last summation comes from Julian 

Savulescu.  Julian.    

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

Okay, both sides agree that cheating is ruining sport, and that 

this is really the tip of the iceberg.  Their position is that we 

should increase the war on drugs, our position is that we should 

adopt a policy of regulated access to performance enhancers that 

are safe enough, and that are consistent with the particular 

sport’s spirit.   This is not a debate about steroids.  If indeed, 

these claims which are largely anecdotal claims are true, that 

steroids have these terrible effects, our side grants that steroids 

under those circumstances should be banned.   However, that 

doesn’t deal with the use of human erythropoietin up to a 

hematacrit of 50 percent, it doesn’t deal with caffeine which is 

already a performance enhancer that’s been legalized, it doesn’t 

deal with growth hormone.  There are many, many substances, in 

baseball, you could use Modafinil to increase reaction time, you 

could use new neutropics such as the Piracetam family to 

increase reaction time.  These substances may well be safe 

enough.  The question is should performance enhancers be 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate 

 “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Page 99. 

 

 

 

allowed, and there are many performance enhancers, our side 

believes, which should be allowed.  Their position is bound to fail, 

it has been failing, it will fail because the prize money and the 

sophistication of the drive to technology—   

BOB COSTAS 

45 seconds.    

JULIAN SAVULESCU 

Paradoxically, it harms athletes.  Our proposal is enforceable, it 

frees up the limited resources to focus on drugs that may be 

affecting children, which we grant should not have access to 

drugs, it could be focused on drugs which are substantially un—

un— harmful to athletes, and drugs which hare against the true 

spirit of sport.   This is not a debate about steroids, it’s about 

whether performance enhancement itself is against the spirit of 

sport.  As we’ve argued, performance enhancement is not against 

the spirit of sport, it’s been a part of sport through its whole 

history, and to be human, is to be better, or at least to try to be 

better.    

BOB COSTAS  

Julian, thank you.  We also thank all of our audience members, 

and again, though we had a spirited and I think every informative 

debate I wish we had had more time for questions from the

thank the debaters and the audience, uh, for their participation.

before the debate, 18 percent of you were for the motion that 

performance-enhancing drugs should be permissible in 

competitive sports.   After the debate, 37 percent agree with this 

side of the table.  Before the debate, 63 percent were against the 

motion.  Now 59 percent are against the motion.  Before the 

debate, 19 percent of you were undecided, and after the debate, 

only 4 percent of you wander into the night still shaking your 

heads, so—  [LAUGHTER]   In summation,  59 percent against, 

37 percent for, so, they improved their position, once the debate 

was over but not enough—   

RICHARD POUND
