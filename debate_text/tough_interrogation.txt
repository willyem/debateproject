ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Thank you and welcome, with me is Dana Wolfe, our executive 

producer.  Well, tonight our resolution is, “Eliot Spitzer Should 

Resign.”  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  Well—well, okay, we’re not 

quite that timely.  But the issue of tough interrogation of terror 

suspects is also very much in the news.   President Bush has just 

vetoed an act of Congress which would have limited the CIA to 

the same interrogation techniques as those approved in the Army 

Field Manual.  But what do these limits amount to, what effect 

might they have on the information that we can glean about 

terrorist activity?   Tough interrogation is not our euphemism for 

torture.  But it does invite discussion about where to draw the 

line.  And terror suspects are not routine criminals.  The threats

they pose are of a different nature entirely.  The discourse on the 

subject has tended to conflate Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and 

waterboarding, and the infamous Justice Department torture 

memo.  We picture an administration running roughshod over 

Geneva Conventions, and our own historic traditions of civil 

liberties and human rights.  More pragmatically, how much 

useful intelligence has actually been gained, and have the costs 

in terms of public support for our policies at home and our image 

as a nation abroad been worth it?  On the other hand, it’s easy to 

forget that the Geneva Conventions are reciprocal agreements, 

giving rights to armed soldiers on both sides of a conflict.  These 

rights are conditioned on soldiers wearing uniforms, in order to 

protect civilian populations from collateral damage, as much as 

possible.  Well, how is this relevant to terror groups who don’t 

abide by Geneva principles, who don’t wear uniforms, and whose 

very purpose is to kill and maim civilians?  CIA terror 

interrogation practices are hardly transparent.  But military 

interrogations are governed by very elaborate legal and 

procedural safeguards.  For the military, it’s highly problematic to 

impose on terror suspects the same physical hardships we use in 

training our own troops, or the same psychological stress 

involved in civilian police interrogations, or even the same degree 

of sleep deprivation experienced by young investment bankers at 

Goldman Sachs.  [LAUGHTER]   We have a superb panel to help

Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary.”    Let me give you 

a brief rundown of the evening.  It’s a really interesting format, 

members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of 

the argument, those presentations will be limited to seven 

minutes.  When opening arguments are complete I’ll open up the 

floor to brief questions from the audience, and after the Q-and-A 

each debater will make a final two-minute summation.  Finally, 

you’ll get to vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad attached to 

your armrest, and I will announce your decision on which side 

carried the day.  But, let’s start with a pre-debate vote.  Pick up 

the keypad attached to the armrest on your left…  Looks like this.

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

Thank you very much.  I will argue that stress interrogation 

techniques are both necessary for getting information from 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 5. 

 

 

 

suspected terrorists after 9-11, and effective in doing so.  I will 

base my arguments on the actual experience of interrogators in 

Afghanistan and elsewhere.   This is not a debate about torture.  

The stress methods that interrogators developed, such as short 

periods of sleep deprivation and isolation, were light years from 

torture.  And to call them such, degrades the moral opprobrium 

that rightly attaches to the term.   As my colleagues will 

demonstrate, the use of stress techniques on terrorists is lawful.  

The burden therefore falls on our opponents, to explain why legal 

and essential methods to gain critical information about future 

terrorist attacks should be off-limits.   It didn’t take long for 

interrogators working in Afghanistan, to realize that the 

traditional army interrogation techniques were nearly useless 

against the Al Qaeda operatives and Taliban fighters whom the 

military was picking up in the fall of 2001.   Those traditional 

techniques, a set of 16 psychological gambits assembled during 

the Cold War, were designed to help young Americans, soldiers, 

debrief Soviet prisoners of war on the battlefield.  The 16 gambits 

have been crafted for use against conventional soldiers, lowly 

grunts, conscripted into a state army, who are often only too glad 

to be taken off the battlefield and out of the war.   Army lore held 

that 95 percent of lawful prisoners of war would divulge 

information upon direct questioning.  In Afghanistan, this ratio 

was reversed.  Virtually none of the terror detainees was giving 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

up information.  Tried-and-true approaches, like appealing to a 

prisoner’s love of family, often had little purchase.   If an 

interrogator offered a jihadist prisoner contact with his wife or 

children, in exchange for information, the jihadist might respond, 

quote, “I’ve divorced this life.  I don’t care about my family,” end 

quote.  Unlike lawful prisoners of war, the terror detainees were 

never off the battlefield.  They continued their vicious attacks 

against their captors at every opportunity while in detention.  

Some of the detainees had been trained in resistance techniques, 

and knew the limits of American interrogation rules.   Others 

quickly learned what those limits were.  So the interrogators 

began cautiously experimenting with stress techniques, such as 

marathon questioning sessions or aggressive behavior, to put a 

detainee on edge.   The purpose of such methods was to recreate 

the shock of capture, that vulnerable mental state immediately 

following capture, when a prisoner is most frightened, uncertain, 

and likely to give up information.  Uncertainty is an interrogator’s 

most powerful ally.  It can lead the detainee to believe that the 

interrogator is in total control, and holds the key to his future.  

An interrogator facing a resistant Taliban explosives-maker, for 

example, might angrily hoist the prisoner up by his collar, and 

storm out of the interrogation booth.   The detainee had 

previously understood that American interrogators couldn’t so 

much as lay a finger on them.  Suddenly, he doesn’t know what 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 7. 

 

 

 

the interrogator’s limits are.  That frightening uncertainty can 

change his calculations about whether to cooperate.   According 

to interrogators in—in Afghanistan and Guantanamo, stress 

worked.  The harsher the methods that the questioners used, the 

sooner they got good information.   Eventually, the military 

codified a set of stress techniques for use in Guantanamo and 

Iraq.  These included keeping a detainee awake at night, putting 

him on cold Army rations instead of hot meals, isolation, 

environmental manipulation, and impersonating a foreign agent.   

All were hedged round with numerous bureaucratic and medical 

safeguards.  None of the stress techniques that the military 

approved for use on terror detainees had anything to do 

otherwise with Abu Ghraib.  Abu Ghraib was the result of the 

unconscionable and culpable breakdown of military discipline, 

throughout the detention camp.   Soldiers sprayed graffiti on the 

walls, engaged in public sexual misbehaver, and operated 

bootlegging and prostitution rings.  Elliot Spitzer is not known to 

have used any of them.  [LAUGHTER]  The guards’ sadistic and 

sexualized treatment of prisoners was an extension of the chaos 

they were already wallowing in.   It had nothing to do with 

interrogation.  Had the rules for prisoner treatment and 

questioning been followed at Abu Ghraib, the abuse couldn’t 

have happened.  In conclusion, the stress interrogation 

techniques that interrogators developed to break detainees’

resistance, were necessary, effective, and lawful.   They were far 

from torture.  In certain instances as—as Bob said, they 

resembled what army recruits and professionals go through as 

part of their training.  As a reality check, here’s the Senate’s 

definition of torture.   It is that barbaric cruelty which lies at the 

top of the pyramid of human rights misconduct—such as 

sustained systematic beating, application of electric currents to 

sensitive parts of the body, and tying up or hanging in positions 

that cause extreme pain.

One.    

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

It would be reckless to ignore the experience of interrogators on 

the ground, who came up against detainee resistance that was 

potentially catastrophic in consequence.  Intelligence about terror 

planning is our only sure defense against attack.  Nothing else 

matters.   Interrogators facing the urgent need to get life-saving 

information from terrorists with likely knowledge of future plots, 

should be allowed to use stress when the questioning techniques 

designed for lawful prisoners of war are not working.  Thank you.

JOHN HUTSON 

Thank you.  Gee, it all sounds so…sweet and benign.  Uh…ask 

‘em a few questions, have ‘em stand up for a while, you 

know…make them take their shirt off, get ‘em a little cold maybe.  

300-pound Iraqi general… stuffed in—head-first—into a sleeping 

bag, bound up with electrical wires, sat on by a Army warrant 

officer…   Hand put over his face every time he screamed out for 

Allah…  Released, put back in, died.  Dead.  That was a stress 

position.  Guy was prosecuted, got six months for some orders 

violations, but, basically, was released because it was an 

authorized stress position.   Taxi driver Dilawar, hung from the 

ceiling, by his wrists. Five days after he’s—not captured, but 

turned over, turned over, to American forces in exchange for a 

ransom, beaten to a point where, according to the autopsy, by an 

Army doctor, his legs are pulpified.  Dead.  By the DOD’s own 

count, approximately 40 people have been killed in the hands of 

the United States, in detention, as homicides.  So let’s not kid 

ourselves that this is some sort of benign search for the truth.  

Torture was never intended to be that.  Torture was intended 

originally, to be an effort to get false confessions.   You’re a 

heretic, you’re a traitor to the king, you’re a witch.  We’ve given a 

bad name to torture.  We’ve misapplied torture, we’re trying to 

use it to find the truth, for Pete’s sake.  My experience has been, 

in doing these kinds of things and these—with these kinds of

groups, that there are a number of people who have a number of 

different points of view about it.   Some of you are moved by 

history, tradition…some of you are moved by the morality of it, 

the moral imperative.  Some of you are moved by diplomacy.  

Some of you are simply moved by the practicality of it.  Are there 

better methods, or is this the best method.  What I want to do is 

address six aspects of torture, or, benign interrogation, whatever 

you want to call it, stuffing people in sleeping bags head first and 

binding them up, and then give each of you the opportunity to 

pick the one that you kind of think works, and then my 

colleagues will hone in on some of them.   First one is that it 

inflames, enrages the enemy, and causes them not to surrender.  

There’s a reason the Nazis surrendered to the Americans on the 

Eastern front and not to the Russians.  In the first Iraq war, tens 

of thousands of Iraqis surrendered to us because they knew that 

they would be treated decently.   My friends, they’re not 

surrendering to us anymore.  It endangers our own troops.  We’re 

the ones on the front lines.  It’s the—it’s US troops at the pointy 

end of the spear, forward-deployed in more locations on more 

occasions in greater numbers than all the other forces of this 

world combined.   There is a reason that the United States 

wanted there to be a Geneva Convention, it wasn’t to protect 

them from us, it was to protect us from them.  And we’ve lost 

that.  John McCain said, that he believes he was treated 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 11. 

 

 

 

incrementally better because the Vietnamese knew—North 

Vietnam knew—that we were abiding by the Geneva Conventions 

in spite of the fact we didn’t have to.   According to the 

arguments, based on the same rationale that the administration 

uses now.  It interferes with our ability to build coalitions, in the 

future wars are gonna be fought by coalition forces.  The United 

States should not and cannot go alone.  We were just put on the 

list of human-rights violators by Canada.   We got them to take 

us off, but the point is…Canada, the Aussies, the Brits, aren’t 

going to want to fight with us if they can’t expect us to comply 

with the Geneva Conventions, and we’re going to be out there at 

the pointy end of the spear, all by our lone.   It causes Americans 

to become torturers.  It’s one thing for us to send our good men 

and women into battle and ask them to give that last full 

measure of devotion.  It’s another thing to send them into battle 

and ask them to become torturers and come home that way.  

Fifthly, it’s simply not the most effective method.  People say, 

“Does torture work?”  Torture-, does torture work isn't the right 

question.  The question is, is there another more effective way to 

do it.  Let me quote to you from, say, General Petraeus, who one 

would think would know something about it.   Some may argue 

that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other 

expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy.  They 

would be wrong.  Beyond the basic fact that such actions are

illegal, tort history shows that they are frequently neither useful 

nor necessary.

The fight depends on securing the pop-, boy, that went fast.  

[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]  I just…

JOHN HUTSON 

…got into this.  The fight depends on securing the populations, 

which must understand that we, not our enemies, occupy the 

high moral ground.   And then finally, and I’d like to return to 

this, because I think it’s, if I get another chance, I think it’s the 

most important issue.  This is an asymmetric war.   In an 

asymmetric war you want to, you want to pit your greatest 

strength against the enemy’s greatest weakness.  Fortunately, in 

this war, that works for us, if we will do it.  Because our greatest 

strength is our ideas and our ideals.   The enemy is completely 

bereft of ideas and our-, and ideals.  Thomas Paine said in 1776, 

“The cause of America is the cause of all mankind.”  Several 

hundred years later, that great geopolitical commentator Bono 

said [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]  America isn't just a country, it’s 

an idea.

BROOKE GLADSTONE  

Ok, thank you.   [APPLAUSE]  For the motion, David Rivkin.  

DAVID RIVKIN 

The critics invariably portray, as you just heard now, 

waterboarding and other stress techniques as torture.  I would 

stipulate easily and readily that waterboarding and other stress 

techniques is a fairly unpleasant practice.   It offends our 21st 

century sensibilities.  It’s something that’s difficult to talk about.  

But I also believe we’re at war with an implacable and ruthless 

foe that thinks nothing about killing civilians by the thousands 

and is seeking to kill millions more.   I don't think anybody would 

disagree about obtaining intelligence is vital in this war.  And we 

can debate, theoretically, the proposition that other techniques 

work, but it’s a matter of fact.  There are instances where 

hardened anti-operatives did not prove susceptible to these 

kinder, gentler techniques, and yet provided intelligence when 

they were subjected to stressful interrogation techniques.  But 

my overarching message to you is that this is a policy debate.  It 

should be a policy debate, which is why asking the question that 

has been posed today is useful.  The obsession of legalities is not 

helpful.  The legal definition of torture is necessarily vague.   The 

torture defined in the ’94 statute which was passed to implement 

obligations under an anti-torture convention, as quote, 

“Intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, both physical 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 14. 

 

 

 

and mental.”  Much of the legal debate about torture boils down 

to the question of how severe is severe.  As far as the physical 

pain and suffering is concerned, it’s almost certainly the case 

that some forms of waterboarding have been practiced by the CIA 

on only three occasions that we know of, with three different 

high-value detainees, rise to the level of torture.  And some 

probably, particularly those that did not involve full inundation of 

the subject do not.  The reason for this is because the physical 

discomfort suffered by the subject of-, being subjected to this 

technique while [UNCLEAR] was not severe enough.  As far as the 

mental severe pain and suffering is concerned, it bears 

emphasizing that Congress deliberately adopted a narrow 

definition of the term “severe” to encompass only, and I quote, 

“prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from the threat of 

imminent death or mind altering substances.”  In my view 

waterboarding and other techniques practiced by the CIA do not 

fit this definition for at least two reasons.  First of all, the practice 

of waterboarding used by the CIA was extremely short, sixty to 

ninety seconds, which certainly suggests even to our lawyer that 

it’s not protracted.  Significant to the question of what is, what 

constitutes protracted was further debated by Congress in 2005 

and 2006 in the context of two key pieces of legislation when 

Congress handled-, and once again, the answer was that there 

has to be some duration, some timeline for something to be 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 15. 

 

 

 

considered protracted.  Second, the high-value terrorist being 

interrogated are perfectly aware that they’re not in any danger of 

death, that the CIA was after information, their lives were not in 

danger.  When Congress passed in the Detainee Treatment Act 

something called “shocks the conscience standard”, which makes 

it even harder to argue that these techniques are always, 

inherently, and absolutely torture, because the shock, shocks the 

conscience standard, by definition-- and it’s something that 

borrows from American case law-- it is inherently a context-

specific standard.  It is not something that you would be able to 

answer in the abstract.  It’s also worthy to point out that while 

the original Justice Department so-called “torture memo” was 

perhaps overly broad in its definition of what level of pain and 

suffering constitutes torture, lots of legal council came up with 

some more nuanced analysis.  Significantly, ladies and 

gentlemen, this analysis was developed by lawyers, at least some 

of whom where critical of the administration’s policy.  Indeed, as 

reported in the media, including by Stuart Taylor of the National 

Journal, the lead author of the subsequent memo by OLC on this 

issue was none other than senior DOJ official Daniel Levin, who 

himself had been subjected to waterboarding as a part of his 

research.  I know that trusting the gallowman is not an argument 

most of you like these days, but I would certainly be inclined to 

trust Dan Levin, who by the way was reportedly forced out by 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 16. 

 

 

 

Alberto Gonzales for not being sufficiently solicitous of the White 

House positions on various other issues.   Now, presented with 

this argument, the critics claim, “Well maybe it’s not torture, but 

maybe it’s cruel inhuman degrading treatment”, which is another 

set of legal buzzwords.  Yet cruel, inhuman and degrading are 

even more capacious terms than torture.  For some detainees, 

the mere fact that they’re being questioned by a Jew or a woman 

is an intolerable humiliation.  Are we supposed to countenance 

and approve this kind of racist sentiment?   Meanwhile, it’s also 

the case that there has to be some reasonable definition of what 

is cruel, inhuman and degrading, because I would submit to you 

that there is a degree of humiliation, cruelty, and degradation in 

any kind of custodial interrogation.   There’s yelling, there’s 

screaming.  Threats are being made against a person or his loved 

ones.  Andy Fastow of Enron fame was told by his interrogators 

that his wife would be imprisoned for a long time, and I would 

submit to you that it was probably a cruel treatment.   So there 

has to be some parameters of behavior that’s clearly-, is cruel 

and degrading and humiliating, but yet does not violate the law.  

My bottom line is this: while the waterboarding debate implicates 

legal issue, we cannot simply abandon the field to the lawyers.  

The lawyers have no special right or expertise to deal with those 

issues.  So our duty as a society is to approach these debates 

seriously, in a mature fashion.   To ask what is really consistent

with our values.  Incidentally, we’ve talked about mistakes.  My 

good friend John mentioned mistakes.  And yes, shoving 

somebody’s head in a sleeping bag is not a good thing.  But as 

you may recall, these problems occur in other contexts.  When I 

was at the Justice Department, one of my responsibilities was 

investigating various bad things that happened in the Bureau of 

Prisons.  And let me assure you ladies and gentlemen, in a 

situation when there is no blessing for stress techniques, instead 

in fact-- prisoners in federal and civil and state penitentiaries not 

being interrogated at all have…

…involving mistreatment by the guards of a child in a boot camp,

trying to set him straight.  This is not an easy debate.  We should 

not focus exclusively on the question of how to deal with enemy 

combatants.   We should ask a broader set of questions of what 

level of coercion are we prepared to tolerate in our public policy, 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

something that our government is doing.  We should not come up 

with one set of regimen for captured unlawful enemy combatants 

when we waterboard our own personnel.  Then there are things 

going on other spheres of public life, including as I mentioned, in 

boot camps that are harsh.  And--, but the last point is whatever 

we do, we should be honest and transparent about this debate.  

We should not use misdirection.  We should not talk in terms of, 

“Well let’s adopt the same standards as an Army field manual.”  

Because ladies and gentlemen, the Army field manual, by the 

way, allows the level of “Mutt and Jeff” technique that does not 

allow the interrogator playing the bad cop to be disrespectful, to 

be tough on an individual.  So here we have politicians 

advocating the level of kindness towards the unlawful enemy 

combatants that exceeds that that’s been adopted with regard to 

interrogation of criminal suspects.   That is not…

represent different fears.  I’m here to represent the facts, not their 

fears.  I have been working for 30 years on torture, on not-

torture for interrogation is, and I quote, the “clumsiest method,” 

and only a, quote, “fool” would use it.   And this is from their 

interrogation manual from Burma in 1943.  Now I don’t care 

whether you call it torture, tough stuff, muffin stuff, not torture.  

The only question really is, as you say, whether it gets the bad 

guys, and here is where everybody gets into storytelling--you’ve 

heard a few.  I have one too.   A World War II vet came up to me 

after a lecture and he said, in France, we caught this German 

soldier and we pulled a knife to his throat and said, where are 

the other soldiers.  And I said, did you get good info?  And he 

said yeah, sorta.   I said I’m happy for you, I really am.  I really 

am.  Because if you had bad info, you’d be dead.  You would be 

dead.  The problem is that everyone who knows that torture or 

not-torture doesn’t work, is dead.  For those for whom it works, 

they are walking around saying it worked for me, it worked for 

them, if…  This is what we call in social science a biased sample.  

[LAUGHTER]   If you take real data from the best studies, armies 

using torture who carefully and selectively selected suspects, 

eighty—8,000 to 20,000 minimum is what you need to get the

best-case scenario, and the best-case scenario that they manage 

to generate out of these cases is 20 to 78 innocent people had to 

be tortured for each bad guy they got.  20 to 78 innocent people 

for each bad guy.   Now, for every accurate piece of info then you 

have to torture in the thousands if you’re professional about it—

this is not retail business.  This is wholesale.  So you tell me, 

does torture work?  I’ll give you the opinion of the professional 

Gestapo.   In 1942 the Czech resistance assassinated Reinhard 

Heydrich, Reichsprotector of Czechoslovakia, Hitler wanted 

results, he didn’t care how, he said these guys don’t listen to 

anything, and the Gestapo got the three bad guys but to do that 

they tortured and killed 7,545 individuals, annihilating two 

villages.  They also got 100 resistance members on the side they 

weren’t looking for but that’s pretty typical results, Battle of 

Algiers, Vietnam, we can go through them.  At this point, enter 

Heinz von Panwitz, a career policeman and head of the Gestapo’s 

anti-sabotage unit from Prague, he said don’t be stupid.   Depend 

on public cooperation, build up rapport, put out a reward.  They 

got over a thousand tips and in fact what broke the case, what 

broke the case, was when Korda, a member of the Czech 

resistance betrayed the entire operation.   Korda wasn’t tortured, 

he lived well, he collected a huge reward, in fact he lived long 

enough to be executed for treason after the war.  [LAUGHTER]  

The professional Gestapo repeatedly decimated the resistance

through public cooperation and informers, in France, Denmark, 

Poland, Norway, Russia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, even in the 

concentration camps.   The Gestapo turned to torture when they 

lost seasoned pros like Panwitz during the war.   And then they 

had young men with whips running around and why learn good 

policing when you’ve got a whip.  Huge government funded 

studies, our government-funded studies, have proven Panwitz 

was right.   If you don’t have public cooperation the chances that 

a crime will be solved falls to 10 percent.  Pathetic results.  The 

Gestapo knew public cooperation was the best anti-terrorist 

method.  Public cooperation works even when time is short.  July 

21st, London, seven guys get on buses with ticking bombs.   The 

British police got all of these guys in 10 days, and the ticking 

bombs.  The big break came in 24 hours when the parents of 

Mukhtar Said-Ibrahim turned their son over after seeing the 

security video.  These were loyal British Muslims.  Would they 

have turned their son over if they knew he was gonna be—not-

tortured?  The answer is no.  Good torture isn’t just a source of 

bad intel, it destroys the only thing that really works, public 

cooperation.  Good rapport weakens even the strongest bond we 

know, good rapport…restores the bond between parent and child.  

Even when time is short.  Using these techniques during World 

War II, the British managed to catch 290 German spies hiding 

among 42,000 refugees crossing over from Europe without

torturing any of them.  I don’t split hairs over what torture is and 

what is not torture.  If what makes torture moral or not-torture 

moral, if it saves innocent lives then the truth has to be that 

torture is immoral.  Because it takes far more innocent lives than 

it has ever saved, and that’s true for not-torture.   Actually, some 

not-torture we use is even worse than torture.  Take sleep 

deprivation.  We use it all the time.  Professional Spanish 

Inquisitors, professional Spanish Inquisitors, wouldn’t go near it.  

They knew sleep deprivation has hypnotic effects under repeated 

questioning, people will generate visions.  Perfect for seeing packs 

of the devil and Al Qaeda everywhere.   That’s why crazy Scottish 

witch-hunters used it.  It was very effective.  But that’s them 

Protestants, not—a Catholic inquisitor would not go near this, 

quote, not-torture.  They knew it was unreliable, and yet we use 

it all the time as if it gets magical results, well it is, it’s magical 

thinking.  That’s all it is.   Good torture creates bad intelligence, 

involves torturing thousands of innocents, while the terrorists 

run free.  It destroys our soldiers who are forced to put in these 

positions [sic], we have the studies, and the organizations.  And 

limited time makes all these effects worse, not better.   That’s the 

data.  The professional Gestapo knew this.  The Japanese Kempei 

Tai knew this.  Even occasionally a Spanish Inquisitor figured 

this one out.

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

One.    

DARIUS REJALI 

With great respect, why shouldn’t we not learn from them.  Good 

counter-terrorism policy depends on winning public support and 

building up human intelligence.  Look.  I used to be on the other 

side.  I grew up in Iran under the Shah.  The Shah’s SAVAK 

tortured terrorists, and the Shah said I don’t torture, we just 

have different ways of doing that, we have to be tough on these 

medieval radical throwbacks.  They’re different.   And Khomeini 

said, medieval throwback, now look who’s talking, the guys who 

torture.  Nothing was a better recruitment tool for Islamic 

radicalism than not-torture.  And so the question is, how many 

countries in the Middle East do you want to lose?  How many 

witch-hunters do you want to follow.  There is intelligence out 

there.  It is time, it is really long past time for us to get our act 

together.  Thank you.

BROOKE GLADSTONE  

No exceptions.  We’ve all heard about the ticking-bomb scenario, 

a moment is precious; we need that information right away.  If 

you agree that there can be exceptions, then where do you draw 

the line?    

DARIUS REJALI 

You know…ticking time-bomb scenarios are wonderful stories, it 

was actually in a wonderful novel from World—from the French 

Algerian story, it’s a wonderful fantasy novel, never happened.  

But I will tell you this.  My book shows this.   Ticking time 

scenarios--if you want to torture under those circumstances, do 

you know what the best result—when it’s gonna get you the best 

result?  During peacetime non-emergency situations, when you 

need it least.  It’s—    

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

I don’t understand.    

DARIUS REJALI 

In other words, torture doesn’t work in wartime situations when 

you have a ticking time bomb, you have to do—it’s a volume 

business at that point.  It is not a retail business.    

BROOKE GLADSTONE  

I still don’t understand, if you have the ticking bomb, whether it’s 

wartime or not, and you know—somebody knows that there is—

DARIUS REJALI 

Look, there was a ticking time bomb in World War II in England, 

right?  Those guys who got off the buses, had a ticking time 

bomb.  It was sitting in the bushes in Brighton, outside a jail.  

The British got it, because they had public cooperation.  And if 

you want to torture, fine, but you’ll not find that bomb.    

BROOKE GLADSTONE  

And now, to this side.  David?  [LAUGHS]   

DAVID RIVKIN 

Yes.   

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

American leadership and our security, I think we can all agree 

are based at least in part on our alliances.   And if America is 

seen as a—is seen in its interrogation methods as a renegade, as 

it has on such issues as say the ABM treaty and the Kyoto 

accords, won’t that endanger our leadership role, and thus our 

security, if we lose that moral high ground and that leadership?   

DAVID RIVKIN 

Brooke, we certainly pay a high price for it but a couple of things 

need to be mentioned, first of all unfortunately the critics that 

promiscuously lump together, the kind of ordinary yelling, 

spittle-flying, psychological pressure, modest, sleep deprivation, 

and label it with the T word, are contributing to this problem.   

The notion that we as a society cannot draw nuances, cannot 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 26. 

 

 

 

draw distinctions between a tough treatment, which my colleague 

Darius here referred to as non-torture and true torture, is frankly 

silly because that’s not what we do in ordinary life.  In any other 

difficult issues.   But more important than that, I am not 

convinced, I’ve heard this argument many times, I’m not 

convinced, Brooke, that the alleged… price we’re paying for this 

aspect of our policy, is sort of a but-for problem.  There’re so 

many other things, that unfortunately our friends and allies do 

not like because they don’t take the threat of radical Islam 

seriously, they don’t believe in, in serious use of military power, 

they’re beyond that.   But if we took that off the table it would 

make a difference.  But the thing that makes me really angry is 

the notion that we are helping the recruitment of jihadis because 

we’re talking about a culture that countenances, without any 

problem, blowing up children, torturing American prisoners to 

death.   See if you tell me…you know, that, we’re people who are 

not troubled by that, they think it’s okay.  But if they ever read 

about some level of sexual degradation, humiliation being 

inflicted on somebody by us, that really ticks them off.  I will tell 

you these are the people who are not gonna win their hearts and 

minds no matter what we try, I find this argument absolutely 

absurd, and the final point about how our soldiers are treated.  

Ladies and gentlemen, our soldiers have been tortured in every 

single war, since the end of World War II.   So the notion that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 27. 

 

 

 

somehow there’s this nirvana, tell this to John McCain.  Tell 

people in Korea when over 50 percent of American POW’s were 

tortured and starved to death.  Look, we have to do the right 

thing because it’s the right thing.  But let’s not pretend that it’s 

going to impact how our people are going to be…dealt with.  By 

this enemy.   

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

Go ahead, Rick—   

RICK FRANCONA 

I think one of the points you were trying to make is that it will 

staunch the willingness of our allies to join with us in these 

coalitions.  I think John, you said coalition is the way we’re 

gonna go in the future.  I agree with that, but I don’t think that 

this aspect is going to pay that big of a role because when you 

look at the interrogation techniques that our allies use, they’re 

much tougher than we are.   Look at the way the French 

interrogate, look at the way the British interrogate, I— that 

they go far beyond our Army Field Manual.    

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

I would also say, in one sense, I take John Hutson’s argument as 

really a confirmation of what we’re arguing because he’s—you 

didn’t address stress, you talked about clear abuses of the 

interrogation rules.  There was no license for stuffing somebody 

in a sleeping bag and suffocating him to death, that was a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 28. 

 

 

 

violation of the rules, not an interrogation pursuant to them—   

JOHN HUTSON 

Nobody stopped it.    

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

And people that have killed detainees have rightly been 

prosecuted.  Most of the deaths occurred at point of capture, not 

in interrogation at that point when you are sort of still at war, 

and it’s a very ambiguous state, but in any case, out of the tens 

of thousands of prisoners that have been taken, 40 criminal 

homicides is…compared to wars in the past is a pretty low rate, 

but in any case, we are not arguing for torture.   My side here is 

talking about stress interrogation and I would say as David does,  

it is perfectly valid to distinguish between keeping somebody up 

late that it—according to the interrogators who’ve written about 

this and spoken about this, reversing somebody’s sleep 

schedules does get information, and burning somebody or 

destroying them and inflicting deliberate severe pain and stress 

on—and suffering on them.  We have to be able to make these 

distinctions.  And, again, to conflate the murder of detainees 

which is clearly a violation of the laws of war, with the calibrated 

use of stress I think, does no service to what we need to be 

debating in the future in the war on terror.

JOHN HUTSON 

Yes, the—   

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

—beforehand?   

JOHN HUTSON 

The—the point is that, in—  This is not an existential war.  World 

War II was an existential, Civil War was an existential war, this 

just happens to be the present war.  And, for us to be here in 

2008, and turn these people into supermen, that the Nazis and 

Imperial Japan were not, is just kidding ourselves.  The problem 

that we face now is that nobody, nobody in the administration 

has had said stop.  Nobody said, they may be terrorists, they may 

be evildoers, but they’re human beings, and we will treat them 

with the dignity and respect that Americans have always treated 

human beings, instead, we just let it run rampant.   In 1950 the 

armed forces officer said “Wanton killing, torture, cruelty or the 

working of unusual, unnecessary hardships on enemy prisoners 

or populations is not justified under any circumstance.”  We have 

backed away from that standard, and we have permitted good 

American men and women to engage in a kind of interrogation 

policy, not because we said, go out and torture, because we 

didn’t.   I mean how—I’d like to have a nickel for every time the 

President’s said, the United States doesn’t torture.  We don’t 

engage in extraordinary rendition.  But the reality of it is, what

was going on there, continued on.   You know, you look at the 

pictures at Abu Ghraib, you look at—you listen to the stories of, 

of what happened at Guantanamo, gloves off, fear down, and it 

was pretty clear that if it wasn’t the express policy it was the 

benign policy of the United States to engage in techniques that 

we had absolutely forbidden.   In 1903 we sent an American 

major to prison for 10 years for waterboarding a Filipino.  We 

prosecuted Japanese for waterboarding, and sent them to prison.   

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

John, to say it’s—we’ve let it run rampant is just not true, people 

that have abused prisoners have been prosecuted criminally.  

When Abu Ghraib came out—   

JACK CLOONAN 

Some, some have been—   

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

—there has been—   

JACK CLOONAN 

—some have been prosecuted—    

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

There has been investigation after investigation of that.  I would 

agree, I think Abu Ghraib, there has not been sufficient, 

responsibility laid on the commanders that let that situation get 

out of control, I think it needs to go way far up the Pentagon 

chain of command but it hasn’t,  but again, that happened in

contravention of the interrogation rules, the interrogation rules, if 

they had been followed to the letter, they said that every 

interrogation technique had to be cleared, had to be monitored.   

What was going on was not interrogation, this was a bunch of 

deranged, sadistic guards, working in the middle of the night, 

that were getting their jollies on these prisoners, it had nothing to 

do with the interrogation rules—

and you’re absolutely right, this was not the interrogations we’re 

talking about.  This was a bunch of military policemen running 

amok, it was a breakdown of—where were their officers, where 

were the NCO’s, it was a complete breakdown of the chain of 

command—

It was set up by the, by the command in Baghdad and there have 

been careers ruined for this, General Sanchez is out of the army 

now.  And he’s—he set up an unworkable chain of command, he 

put the intelligence people in charge of the prison.  You don’t do 

that—

techniques that were actually used in Vietnam.  Somebody told 

them what to do, it wasn’t a simple improvisation—   

[OVERLAPPING VOICES]   

JACK CLOONAN 

—we’re having this debate and the public should, I think, 

understand this.  We’re having this debate as if, and I think 

Heather articulated this point, tried to make this point, that 

everybody that came in on the battlefield in Afghanistan, whether 

they be Taliban or a so-called Arab insurgent, really had a lot of 

information.   Her position is that people were not cooperating.  

They were not cooperating, and because they had been trained.  

When the fact of the matter is they weren’t trained.  The fact of 

the matter was the reason why they weren’t cooperating, was 

because they didn’t know anything.   By and large, you have to 

separate the Taliban from the Arab Al Qaeda fighter.  They’re two 

distinct groups.  In point of fact, they don’t get along quite well.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 33. 

 

 

 

So if somebody is not cooperating, it doesn’t mean that they have 

been trained.   The fact of the matter is that a lot of our people on 

the ground in Bagram, and I’m quite familiar with it, on the 

military side, had no idea what they were doing.

Well, we’ll just follow up on some of this, I had several pages of 

notes here, but Heather and David went through them quite 

quickly, so—  [LAUGHS]  I’ll speak to some of the subjects that 

we’ve brought up here—all this is great theory.  I appreciate what 

all of the other speakers have brought to this, and most of the 

time we’re talking theory.   I’d like to inject some reality into this.  

I’m going to submit that I’m probably the only one on the stage

that’s been waterboarded.  I don’t consider it torture, but by no 

means do I consider it pleasant and it’s not something you sign 

up to do, you know, for your summer camp.   The Air Force did it 

during our training to show us what it was like, the purpose of it 

was to show us the treatment that we could expect as potential 

prisoners of war.  And the point was made and I want to 

underscore this, never in our history have we gone into a conflict 

and our prisoners been treated right, the Geneva Convention was 

an attempt to make that happen.   I submit that it has failed 

miserably.  It restricts what we can do, we make sure we treat 

people right, and we get no reciprocal treatment at all.  So it does 

not work—now.  John McCain will tell you that torture doesn’t 

work, and that he’s against it because of his experiences in North 

Vietnam.  No one can take away the fact that he was brutally 

treated, brutally tortured, and he has the gravitas to address this 

issue.   But you have to understand that John McCain was the 

victim of torture for the infliction of pain.  The Vietnamese were 

great at that.  They could hurt you, they could make you say 

things that maybe you didn’t want to say.   For the most part, our 

prisoners did very well.  They gave up what they thought their 

interrogators wanted to hear which is the biggest threat you have 

when you resort to torture.  Whoever you’re torturing, the 

subject, is going to tell you what he thinks you want to hear.   

Just like a defector, we’ve seen how bad information leads to bad 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

actions, remember Curveball.  The bad information about the 

Iraqi mobile labs.  This is another instance where people tell you 

things they [sic]  want to hear.   Someone being tortured will tell 

you anything, anything, to stop the pain, to stop the treatment.  

Waterboarding, someone mentioned a figure 60 to 90 seconds.  I 

can tell you that after about 35 seconds I was ready to tell them 

anything they wanted to hear.   And I knew this was an exercise.  

You know, and in the back of your mind, your instructors are 

telling you, project yourself into a situation.  Imagine this to be 

real.  I survived by telling myself, I know this is a game.  That 

they’re going to let me up before I drown.  So, there is that reflex, 

and waterboarding is so powerful, that it will make you say 

something.  So, in the hands of skilled interrogators, can 

waterboarding work?  Absolutely, but you have to know what 

you’re doing.   The North Vietnamese did not know what they 

were doing.  They were great at inflicting pain, lousy at extracting 

effective, useful  intelligence.  Now does it work?  Well, you hate 

to say trust the government.  But we have two government 

officials that say it worked.   That would be the former director of 

Central Intelligence, George Tenet, and the director of the bin 

Laden Unit, Alex Station.  Dr. Mark Shore, you’ve seen him on 

television, he’s making the rounds, I think he has a book out.  It 

can be effective if it’s done properly.  The question is, not, can we 

do it, the question is, should we do it?  And that’s where we have 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 36. 

 

 

 

to decide, or is the tough interrogation of these suspects 

necessary…do we want to go beyond whatever line that is.  I can 

tell you the line that the government is trying to draw, is the 

Army Field Manual, I worked under the Army Field Manual, it’s 

pretty restrictive, the new one is even more restrictive, they 

rewrote it in November of 2006.   It’s online, type in to Google, 

“Army Field Manual Interrogation,” it’s a voluminous document, 

it’s written in typical Army bureaucratese, there’s probably four 

pages in it worth reading.  So, and those are the ones that tell 

you the 16 psychological approaches you can use, none of which 

will be effective against a terrorism suspect because those 

techniques were written, just as someone said, to break a 

captured enemy soldier.   One probably with no resistance 

training whatsoever.  When we started taking large amounts of 

prisoners, in Desert Storm, we had thousands, tens of thousands 

of Iraqi prisoners that we had to interrogate, we had to assess, 

and determine if they were worth questioning.   And once we 

determined that they were worth questioning, most of the time if 

you asked them a question, they gave you the answer.  It was 

very surprising to us, to learn that all these techniques really 

weren’t necessary because the Iraqis had no training, most of 

them were happy just to be away from Saddam Hussein.  Very 

powerful tool.   The ones that did not want to cooperate with us, 

usually you found some major or lieutenant-colonel in the

Republican Guard that didn’t want to talk to you, and that’s 

when those techniques became somewhat effective, but there 

were always ones that would spit at you, because they knew you 

couldn’t hurt them.  They knew the Americans followed the 

Geneva Conventions.  They knew, that you weren’t gonna hurt 

them.  You couldn’t touch them.  Until some—and I won’t use 

any personal references here, some lieutenant-colonels I know,  

would throw them down to the ground, pull out a pistol, put it to 

their forehead and say, tell me what I need to know, whatever the 

question was, or I’m gonna blow your brains out.   That now will 

get you thrown out of the Army, without your retirement.  Back 

then it was not common use but it was pretty effective because, 

it’s real easy in theory to know that the Americans can’t hurt you.   

But, when the gun is on your forehead, you’re not sure if this is 

the one American that didn’t get the memo.  So this can be 

effective.  Now, I think we—

—we have to be somewhat reticent in applying these forms of 

interrogation.  But I think we would be foolish, absolutely foolish 

to outlaw them.  I think the President was right to veto any bill 

that limits what the CIA can do.   And this is only limiting the 

CIA, the neutered Department of Defense is already constrained

by the Army Field Manual.  The idea is to extend that to the entire 

government.  I think that’s a mistake, we still have to have this 

tool in our arsenal because some people in the government 

who’ve done this for a living, say that it works.  George Tenet said 

it saved lives, I don’t know that to be true, I don’t know it to be 

not true.  But I think we would be very foolish to take an arrow 

out of the quiver.   And I do think this is an existential war.  And 

I think it is a war that we’re gonna be fighting for a long time.  I 

think we need to apply every weapon we have.

JACK CLOONAN 

Good evening.  I don’t believe that harsh interrogation techniques 

actually work.  I’m going to explain to you why, and I’m going to 

explain a little of my background as to why I’ve come to that 

conclusion.  The question before us tonight is actually very, very 

important and it’s very, very important to you personally.   I’m  

going to take us down from this sort of nuanced, 30,000-foot view 

that we’ve had discussed thus far, and I’m gonna take it down to 

what I like to call the practical level, the operator’s viewpoint, 

because that’s where I come from.   That’s what my job was.  

That’s what I was charged to do.  I was charged in 1996, to 

eliminate bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and others as a threat to

US national security.   And I found myself in the enviable position 

of having to travel around the world, and find members of Al 

Qaeda, and gain their cooperation.  And I can assure you as I sit 

here tonight, being very proud of what the end result of that was, 

that I did not engage in any harsh interrogation techniques.   It 

didn’t involve sleep deprivation, it didn’t involve threats from 

dogs.  It didn’t involve hijinks, and all the other stuff that we’ve 

heard about.  We have a deficit, ladies and gentlemen, that we 

are facing.  And that deficit has to be, that we do not have as we 

sit here tonight, really good human intelligence.   Yes, we spend 

an awful lot of money.  We can intercept and suck up emails from 

all around the world.  But we don’t really know what we have.   

We have a very hard time processing what we have.  And when 

you have the opportunity to sit across the table from a real 

member of Al Qaeda, a person who has raised their right hand 

and swore bayat, or allegiance to Sheikh bin Laden, it’s your 

obligation to get information from them, and to ensure that that 

information is reliable.  I would think even Rick would freely 

admit, in some of his writings he has stated that harsh 

interrogation techniques typically don’t work.  In fact, rapport 

building is what works.  We’re always having this discussion 

about the ticking bomb.   The scenario that if we don’t get this 

information right away when we’re confronted with somebody 

who we believe has this sort of information, that lives will be at

stake, and that we have to engage in these harsh interrogation 

techniques or, as we’ve just described, waterboarding.  When Abu 

Zubaydah was waterboarded, and we now know that to be the 

case, he was waterboarded after he was in custody for thirty 

days.  He was waterboarded because the agency, the CIA would 

argue, because what we were trying to get out of him we weren't 

getting out of him.  Yet I have been able to speak to people who 

told me rhyme and verse about Abu Zubaydah.  Abu Zubaydah is 

not what you think he was.  Abu Zubaydah was a great travel 

agent.  He was a logistics person.  He was not what has been 

described, as a key Al Qaeda operative, quite the opposite.  So 

when we engage in these techniques, there is a pushback from 

the opposition.  And what does that pushback mean to you?  

What does that mean to you and your families?  Because when 

we push back and when we engage in these type of techniques, 

the opposition is duty-bound, the enemy, as we’ve heard 

described here tonight, is duty-bound to get revenge.  There is a 

constituency that you have not heard from tonight.  And that is 

Al Qaeda.  I am going to tell you what Al Qaeda has to say about 

torture.   I am going to tell you what Sheikh bin Laden had to say 

about torture.  And I'm going to tell you that from the prospective 

of having to deal with Ali Abdul Saud Mohammed who created 

the Encyclopedia of Jihad.  Who taught people what to do and 

not to do if in fact arrested by the unbelievers, we, the blood

people.   Bin Laden’s view was that any brother who was picked 

up and withstood torture for 72 hours, he and the other members 

of Al Qaeda would not seek revenge against him.  Even bin Laden 

understood and did not take revenge against those who 

cooperated with the United States.   Think about that for a 

moment.  I can talk to you about Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi, which 

you’ve probably  all heard about.  I happened to be on the 

receiving end of a lot of information that Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi was 

giving up to the FBI in Bagram, Afghanistan.  Ibn al-Sheikh al-

Libi is the man who’s alleged to have given information that was 

used in Colin Powell’s speech before the United Nations.  Ibn al-

Sheikh al-Libi agreed to cooperate with the United States…

…through rapport building.  And he agreed to cooperate with the 

United States, but he was duct taped, put into a cardboard-, or a, 

or plywood box, and shipped and rendered off to Egypt to be 

interrogated.   He had agreed to cooperate with us.  This was a 

policy decision that was made.  Good counterterrorism policy has 

to include the end result of what we do, whether it’s on the 

battlefield or whether it’s on the streets of New York.  Rapport 

building, treating people humanely, getting information, solid 

intelligence is what we’re after.  There’s too much at stake, your

safety is at stake, to engage in harsh interrogation techniques, 

which is going to cause the enemy to seek revenge against each 

of you.  

BROOKE GLADSTONE  

Thank you.   [APPLAUSE]  I have one last question and only a few 

minutes to get an answer, and I'm going to address the same 

question to both sides.  And that is, is this foe different from the 

other foes that we’ve faced?   This foe has stated, especially the 

high-value prisoners, those on the inside of Al Qaeda have stated 

that it is-, they are ready for death.  Can you break this foe by 

building a rapport?  Jack?  Rick?  

RICK FRANCONA 

Yeah, I’ll take that.  Ideally, you want to break any foe.  And Jack 

goes-- I mean, I agree that rapport building, if you have time, is 

the best way to go.  The question is sometimes you don’t.  The 

other point is sometimes you don’t have the time.   But I believe 

this foe is a different one that we’ve ever-- than we’ve ever faced 

before.  We’re not dealing with a state.   We’re not dealing with 

someone with defined borders.  The people--these are not soldiers 

in an army.  This is an ideal.  This is a-- these are committed 

warriors in a religious battle.  And I think that brings something 

that we’ve never dealt with before, and I don't think we’re very 

well-prepared to do that.

Jack seems to be arguing that it is silly to counterproductively 

use stress techniques and accomplish reliable rapport.  Nobody 

disagrees.  Nobody would-- be a fool to suggest to promiscuously 

use stress techniques.  But it’s equally foolish to say we should 

never use them.  Because there may be circumstances where

engaging in sleep depravation.  It doesn’t mean that I was 

engaging in some of these other techniques that we’ve now all 

identified.  The harshest thing I ever had to do was to let

moment.  But first, I want to announce the results of the pre-

debate vote.  And before the debate, for the motion, which is--, I 

want to have the exact wording here, “tough interrogation of 

terror suspects is necessary.” 46% of you voted for the motion.  

35% voted against the motion.   19% were undecided.  So, so 

much for some on the panel that thought this was going to be an 

excessively liberal audience.   [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]  So, now 

I’d like to open up the floor for Q&A.  Please stand up when you 

have your question.  I ask that you don’t start to ask your 

question until you have the microphone, this is radio.  Please 

make the questions short and to the point.  And it would be great 

if members of the press would identify themselves as such.  Have 

we got a question ready?  All right.  

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

The arguments on both sides so far have been mostly utilitarian.  

Torture works, torture doesn’t work.  Torture has side effects.  

But there hasn’t been much said about the moral high ground, 

and America showing leadership in an ethical and moral 

universe.  The “do unto others as you would have them do unto 

you.”  What about the moral issue in here, which I think is a 

problem that many of us have?   

DAVID RIVKIN 

Can I just say very briefly, let the record show, that nobody’s 

arguing on our side in favor of torture.  The shame, frankly, the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary” (3/11/08) Page 50. 

 

 

 

fault lies with the critics that damn everything with the T word 

and paint with a broad brush.   We’re not talking about torture.  

We’re talking about the level of coerciveness and unpleasantness 

that permeates our spheres of public life without drawing any 

opposition from anybody.  You tell me why in order for us to 

occupy the moral high ground we should eschew, give up, 

whatever verb you want to use, a level of coercion that is 

routinely used in other areas, including training of our own 

troops, specialized and advanced training, federal and state 

penitentiaries, boot camps for juvenile offenders.  That makes no 

sense for us as a society to-- instead of having a common 

baseline that is not torture--to have privileged, uniquely 

privileged-, only one set of people, captured Al Qaeda and Taliban 

terrorists.  If that is morality, it’s silly.  The… 

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

That’s David Rivkin.  Darius Rejali?  Do you want to try this one 

on?   

DARIUS REJALI 

Sure.  I’ll take that on.  Look, you keep on saying that we do 

these things domestically and we should do them internationally 

and what’s the problem.  Well, a couple of problems.  First of all, 

let me just say a couple of things.  A young professor comes to 

me and he says, “Could you tell me exactly what sexual 

harassment is?  I mean, if I do a little bit of it, is it ok?”  You’d 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

think that’s creepy, right?  These people are talking about, “Let’s 

do a little bit of it.”  And it’s creepy.  And it should creep you out, 

okay?   Because there are certain things you shouldn’t get 

anywhere near.  The line between domestic and international, 

whatever you want to call these things, not torture, is a thin one.  

And every war that we have used torture, the Philippines, when 

we used that in the insurgency, those guys, they come home, 

what kind of jobs do they get?  They get jobs as policemen, prison 

guards, and your private security officials.  And behind them 

follows torture.  Or not torture, call it what you will.  Chicago is 

paying twenty million dollars thanks to Mr. Burge and his fifty 

detectives who brought all their lovely techniques back from 

Vietnam.  Look, at the end of this war, whether these guys get 

their way or not, people are coming back.  And they’re going to be 

your cops, your neighborhood officials.  They’re going to be your 

private people.  And yes, there is a difference between domestic-

international.  But this stuff travels.

…is, if this is important for us to do, to save American lives 

because we’ve got this superhuman enemy that we have never 

faced before, because this foe is different and they are so 

dedicated, if this is important for us to do at some level, then to 

the moral imperative question, why should we stop at all?  Why 

not the rack?  Why not perfidy?  Why not treachery?  Why not all 

kinds of things?  Because if that’s the moral thing to do in order 

to save lives, then by George, we ought to be doing it across the 

board and not stopping ourselves anywhere short.  I think that 

the world has relied, we’ve, the United States has been far from 

perfect.  Our history is replete with examples of where we have 

failed in big things and in little things.   But the world has relied 

on us to stand for the rule of law and for human rights.  And it’s 

not a rule of law, if you only apply it when it’s convenient.   And 

it’s not a human right if it only applies to some people.  We need 

to stand tall in this, and not draw lines because this enemy is the 

worst enemy we have ever faced.   

DAVID RIVKIN 

I—I—   

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

I can—let me just argue that, first of all what we are doing is 

within the rule of law because a terrorist detainee is not covered 

by the Geneva Convention—

It’s how you define the law—   

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

And—we are— he is covered by the Convention Against Torture, 

there is no question.  We are obligated to follow the Convention 

Against Torture, that’s why it matters to make the distinctions 

that Darius refuses to.  We are not arguing torture on this side.   

And Darius, you seem to think that the only possible set of 

questioning techniques are these random— it was rather 

arbitrary what got put into the Army Field Manual.  You yourself 

know, there has been, contrary to the claims on the other side,  

there has been no serious empirical work on the—even on the 

Army Field Manual.   Are you suggesting that those are the only 

possible… questioning techniques that can ever be used, and 

that somehow they are handed down from on high as the 

absolute way of questioning.   There may have been 12, if Mutt 

and Jeff had  not originally been included in them, my guess is 

that if we were now pro—…

push it out of the water.  It’s a small group of people, and you 

need to have Iraqi civilians come in and turn people and I have 

not been the one who argued for the interrogation manual.   I 

have said, that all the studies show that unless you have public 

cooperation on your side, the chances that you will be able to 

clear and solve a crime will fall to 10 percent regardless of how 

you interrogate them, right.   So it doesn’t matter what you throw 

at this problem, right.  And the more you do your not-torture 

stuff, the more problematic it is, let me get to another thing.  

Barbaric, different kind of enemy, sure.  They’re vengeful.  And in 

the Middle East, they never forget.   You know this.  You know 

that in the Middle East they never forget.  You can get away with 

this.  Do they have weapons of mass destruction?  Well as I 

understand, Mr. al-Libi after he was beaten up by the Iraqis, by 

the Egyptians actually, said that, Saddam Hussein trained Al 

Qaeda in weapons of biological and chemical destruction.   The 

Pentagon yesterday produced this huge report that proved that 

this was entirely false.  But it went into the President’s speech in 

October in 2002 [sic] and it was part of the case that took us to 

war.  And let me tell you, I don’t know how many lives these not-

torture techniques have saved.   But I can tell you how many 

lives it’s taken.  It’s taken everybody who’s died.  [APPLAUSE]

do you have a question for the other side.   

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

Well, I’m just puzzled by the idea that, with—if you have Khalid 

Shaikh Mohammed  in detention, I’m not sure what the public 

cooperation is that you’re going to expect to get information from 

him.  The 9-11 Commission report, you’re claiming that 

interrogation stress did not work.   They said that half of the 

information in that report came from the interrogation of high-

value—   

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

Is that the question?   

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

Yeah, how do you—why are you disagreeing with the fact that, 

the interrogation of high-value detainees did produce valuable 

intelligence that allowed us to—

information that was of high value, was not stuff that he gave up 

after he was waterboarded.  The real critical stuff was in the 

apartment where he was seized.  He jumped out the back window 

and in the apartment was a treasure trove of computers, 

documents, cell phones and the like.   And so when they end—

started to do their routine grunt work, and do the document 

exploitation and all the other stuff, that’s what led ultimately to 

the arrest if you will or the capture of Khalid Shaikh, and Ramzi 

ben Al-Shif [PH].    

BROOKE GLADSTONE  

That was Jack Cloonan.  John Hutson, have you got a question 

for the other side?   

JOHN HUTSON 

Yes, I do.  

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

The side in favor of the proposition?   

JOHN HUTSON 

Yes.  There’s been a lot of talk about the Army Field Manual and 

the difference now between DOD  and the CIA.   The President 

just recently vetoed the Intelligence Bill, which contained—

would’ve made the CIA subject to the Army Field Manual.   The 

Army Field Manual says,  “Use of torture by US personnel would 

bring discredit upon the United States and its armed forces while 

undermining domestic and international support for the war

effort.”  Not making a distinction between the CIA and the army, 

just talking about domestic and intellectual support.  “It could 

also place US and allied personnel in enemy hands at greater risk 

of abuse.”   

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

There’s a question there, right—   

JOHN HUTSON 

Well, it—there’s going to be.  [LAUGHTER]  Which of—now 

these— the Army Field Manual, or the Intelligence Bill  that the 

Army Field—that would’ve incorporated the Army Field Manual, 

has the following prohibitions.  Which of these prohibitions would 

you say is okay for the CIA, and therefore for the United States.   

Forcing a prisoner to be naked, perform sexual acts—and this is 

what the President vetoed.  Forcing a prisoner to be naked, 

perform sexual acts or pose in a sexual manner.  Placing hoods 

or sacks over the head of a prisoner, using duct tape over their 

eyes.   Applying beatings, electric shocks, burns and other forms 

of physical pain, waterboarding, military working dogs, 

hypothermia or heat injure, mock-executions and depriving a 

prisoner if necessary of food, water and medical care.  Now, 

which of those do you think it’s okay for the CIA on behalf of the 

United States to engage in, in order to get information.   

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

Rick, do you wanna take that one?

Well, since I think he’s reading from my article—  [LAUGHTER]   

JOHN HUTSON 

No, actually I’m not.    

RICK FRANCONA 

That’s the Field Manual, right.  It’s—  well, this is what the Army 

is prohibited from doing, I’m not saying the CIA should be 

allowed to do any or all of these, I’m just saying you shouldn’t 

extend this manual to the CIA, the CIA operates under different 

rules.

because these were, this bill was vetoed—    

DAVID RIVKIN 

But that’s—with all due respect, John, that’s not all that the 

Army Field Manual does, my favorite example is, and I wish I had 

it in front of me.  If you look at the definition of a good cop versus 

bad cop, there’s a restriction on how bad a bad cop can be.  The 

bad cop cannot act in a manner that’s disrespectful to the person 

being interrogated.   I would submit to you it’s not a question of

violating the law on the domestic side.  In virtually every police 

station, the bad cop is pretty damn disrespectful to the drug 

dealers and rapists and muggers.  We’re talking about using the 

rules we’re not using in our criminal justice system.  That John is 

absurd, it’s insanity.  It’s not morality—

you’d walk away from that experience being very humble…and 

understanding what you’re up against.  To the gentleman’s 

question, about the moral imperative.   If you think, ladies and 

gentlemen and my distinguished colleagues over here, that we 

can defeat this enemy, with guns and bullets, and throwing 

money at this, you’re wrong.  This is an epic struggle, this is a 

struggle for the next generation, and it’s the biggest challenge 

that we’re gonna have to face.   And I don’t want to make it any 

more difficult than what it is.  And when you engage in some of

DAVID RIVKIN 

Why do you claim, that false, misleading information and lying 

only emanates from people who are being interrogated stressfully, 

the last time I checked, every criminal, every terrorist routinely 

lies and your job as an interrogator is to sift the truth from 

fiction.   Isn’t it the case that the biggest problem is, when a 

person says nothing, zero, nada.  Not the fact that somebody’s 

lying because you have enough time to cross-reference things, 

you can learn as much from lying, as from a person doing truth-

telling, but everybody lies.    

BROOKE GLADSTONE  

Okay.  Does anybody want—

DAVID RIVKIN 

Bad guys—bad guys lie—   

DARIUS REJALI 

—the question is analysis.  Look.  The guilty will lie no more nor 

—nor less, the problem is a selection problem.  You have a fuzzy 

context in which you can’t tell who is a big fish, who’s a small 

fish.  Who is Al Qaeda, who isn’t.  These are people who hide as 

ordinary civilians, you’ve all admitted this, right?   So you have a

selection problem.  You have to pull in large numbers of people, 

and there, you have to decide who is guilty and who is innocent.  

The guilty, you’re right, absolutely will lie no more or less if you 

do whatever you want to do to them, right?   But the innocent, oh 

my God.  If you start torturing—torturing the innocent to 20 to 

78 at that rate, you’re going produce a mound of false 

information.  You’re weighing down the exact war effort you want 

to win.  And not only that, I ask you, what American value does it 

promote to torture 20 to 78 innocents to get your one hit?   

BROOKE GLADSTONE

DAVID RIVKIN 

—here is what you are suggesting—first of all, you guys don’t 

have your act together.  The two people on both sides are making 

a utilitarian argument, it doesn’t work, we don’t need it.  You’re 

making an absolute argument that there are certain things called 

torture that you should never do.  Actually we agree.  The 

question is this, are we gonna be a mature society, have a serious 

discourse about what is or isn’t torture, it’s distasteful, but it’s 

necessary, are we just going to clap our hands and say everything 

is torture.

—I think it was Darius, you said that the motivation for 

cooperation the public…you used the public cooperation is how 

you would round these guys up.  I don’t—I’m not sure that’s 

always the case, would you say that’s why Al Qaeda in Iraq is 

being taken apart by the Anbar cooperative group out there, 

they’re doing it because we’re gonna kill them, not because we’re 

not going to be nice to them.   

DARIUS REJALI 

You know, one of the nasty things about Al Qaeda, and this is 

true about all terrorist torture, let’s be clear, these people are 

barbarians, right, they chop off heads.  They’re incompetent at it, 

they know they’re going to get a rise out of us.  I have relatives, 

let me just be—I’ll be honest with you.   I have relatives who used 

to collect eyeballs.  Right?  Beheading is ridiculous as, it’s clearly 

a bait, and it’s clearly designed to get us to make mistakes.  Now, 

one of the things any Oriental ruler would have known, is not to 

fall for that bait, right?   Terrorists don’t have fixed assets, they

don’t have jails, they don’t have places, they have to be on the 

run, they have to depend on safe houses.  What I’m finding right 

now in Al-Anbar, is we’re finding torture chambers.  You know 

what that means?  It means they’re feeling comfortable enough to 

build torture chambers.  That is not good.   

DAVID RIVKIN 

But wait a minute, it doesn’t work so it must hurt them more 

than it helps them—   

DARIUS REJALI 

Oh—it works—  [LAUGHTER]  I’ll tell you what it works for.  It 

works to intimidate, it works to make false confessions.  I am 

happy to stipulate that, although I will say this too.  We have all 

the records of French torture from the Ancien Regime.  And we 

know that these guys boiled people’s feet in oil.  They water-

boarded.  Do you know how many actually said anything?  Do we 

have a single document left of a confession, three to 14 percent.  

That’s what false confessions are.   And let’s not even worry 

about the true and false confe—  The other part of this is, you 

think that, well, if the guy breaks, oh, we’ll know whether it’s true 

or not.  Again, 40 years of psychological research will tell you 

this, we’re really, really bad at telling the difference between truth 

and lies, even interrogators, we’ve tested them, I’m sorry.  There 

is no argument here.

you have the time to do that, the biggest problem is not what you 

know about a suspect, it’s about what you don’t know.   And 

what you don’t know is what’s the timeline.  And you have to get 

to that very quickly.  And if you have any reason to believe that 

he’s got, you know, information of an imminent value, then 

you’ve got to ramp up the treatment.   You know, ideally if you 

think this guy, okay, this is a low-level Taliban guy who probably 

doesn’t know much, let’s sit down and talk to him, and find out 

who he might know, where the training camps here, the routine 

order of battle kind of stuff you’d want to prosecute a war.  But if 

you grab a guy, maybe bin Laden’s driver who was driving a set of 

orders somewhere, but you don’t know where, be nice to know 

where that is before the action happens.

teammates on this waterboarding question.  I heard Rick

Francona say, when he was subjected to it voluntarily, he broke 

after 30 seconds.  David Rivkin says 60 to 90 seconds, isn’t 

torture.  That seems like a long time for some— if Rick Francona 

has it—has it right, and…  Second, Rick Francona cites Michael 

Scheuer and George Tenet as sources saying that waterboarding 

was effective.  But…are those two credible?  [LAUGHTER]  Is 

George Tenet credible, he of the slam-dunk assessments and 

Michael Scheuer, who is going around the country saying that 

Israel is running clandestine operations against the United 

States, through the Holocaust Museum?    

BROOKE GLADSTONE  

Well, that’s—quite a question.  [LAUGHTER]   

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

Well, I wasn’t aware of Michael Schauer’s testimony, I would rely 

on the 9-11 Commission report, I don’t know what the relevance 

of the seconds that people have held out, but…clearly we have 

gotten actionable intelligence from the high-value CIA detainees.  

What I—what I don’t understand is obviously we do need to think 

about this, not just as a utilitarian matter but a moral one.  But 

why is it necessary, the moral position, to say that, we are not 

going to use stress on a single Al Qaeda detainee, and risk the 

possible destruction of hundreds if not thousands of innocent 

civilians, I—to me it—it’s not clear that the moral position, puts 

more value on the protecting of temporary extreme discomfort of

one person who is pledged to destroy as many Americans as he 

can, that that’s moral to protect him, and to sacrifice thousands 

of American lives, the idea that stress does not work, never 

works, is an easy out.  The fact is is that, regimes have 

used…torture, again, which is not what we are arguing for today.   

But even torture, has been shown to work, the French used it in 

the Algerian war, and they got information—

time ago now talking about the various considerations in—that 

we’ve been talking about today, tonight.  Legal, moral, diplomatic, 

practical.  But let me go to the one very quickly that I think is, for 

me, most convincing.   The enemy can’t beat us militarily.  

They’ve gotten a lift—they’ve gotten very little communication.  

They’ve got IED’s, they’ve got suicide bombers, they cannot defeat 

the United States of America militarily.   But I’ll tell you how we 

can lose this war on terror…we can commit national suicide.  

And the way we’ll commit national suicide, is by disarming 

ourselves, giving up our greatest weapon, and our greatest 

weapon isn’t our military might, or our natural resources, or the 

essential island nature of our land-mass—   

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

One.    

JOHN HUTSON 

It sure as heck isn’t our economy right now.  Our great strength 

is—Bono and Thomas Paine had it right—is who we are.  And if 

we give up who we are, who we are as a nation, that’s a victory 

for the enemy.  The enemy knows he can’t defeat us militarily.   

Killing us isn’t their goal.  Our will to win, defeating our will to 

win isn’t the enemy’s goal.  The enemy’s goal in the war on terror 

is to bring us down to them, to make us ever so slightly more like 

they are.  To make us as miserable and pathetic as they are.   

And if we engage in the same tactics…they will have won that

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

Heather?  Thank you very much, John Hutson, now Heather Mac 

Donald for the motion.    

HEATHER MAC DONALD  

Well, I agree with the opponents that we need as many highly 

trained interrogators as we can get, they should be as fully versed 

in language and cultural skills and that has—clearly has been a 

weakness.  But I would submit that the trained interrogators with 

the CIA were facing resistance that the existing tools that they 

had available to them were not able to overcome.   And I don’t 

believe that the 16 army interrogation rules are the only possible 

interrogation techniques that should ever be available as we face 

an enemy that is not going to seek revenge because we are using 

stress, because they wanted to kill us 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 

and destroy as much as we can.  I think that there are going to 

be times when—   

BROOKE GLADSTONE 

One.    

HEATHER MAC DONALD 

—stress is necessary.  If we are facing an imminent threat, if we 

have somebody with, with knowledge of the next plot, we’re not 

going to have time to spend the months that it can take to build 

rapport.   And if using stress on somebody with knowledge of the

BROOKE GLADSTONE  

Again—  [APPLAUSE]  Against the motion, Darius Rejali.   

DARIUS REJALI 

Is it better to be loved or feared.  Loved or feared.  The correct 

answer is that if you can fight with one hand tied behind your 

back and win, you will be loved and feared.  If—and that’s the 

American way.  If you want to be merely loved, you’ll be despised, 

if you really want to be feared, you’ll be despised.   My great-

grandfather wanted to be feared.  He was a very powerful Persian 

prince.  He didn’t hesitate to torture and kill anyone who got in 

his way.  He cloaked his values in blood.  And no one misses him 

today, and his world is gone.  I accepted this invitation today, 

regardless of this debate, win or lose, just to tell you all one thing 

I know.   Don’t make the same mistake my great-grandfather did.  

Don’t make the same mistake the Shah of Iran did.  No one will 

miss you either.  Do not close the values that I have come to this 

country for, do not close them in blood and make them a sham.  I

can follow bagpipes into battle if you want, but the reality doesn’t 

change.  In the end the Pied Piper keeps on playing all that hot 

air, the boys at the front die, and the pipers go back to the think 

tanks and have fine careers.   You can’t have—you can’t win a 

football game with a bunch of Hail Marys, you can’t do it based 

on interrogation based on faith.  We’ve told you the only thing 

that really works.  Public cooperation, rapport-building.  And if 

you’re still on the fence and you don’t know where to  vote, I just 

have it on good authority by the way, that Rick Francona is a 

card-carrying member of Red Sox Nation.  [LAUGHTER]

DAVID RIVKIN 

We are facing a very serious threat.  One of the reasons that is 

the case, it’s not a question of numbers, it’s not a question of 

technology, it’s the question of dedication.  It’s been decades 

since we fought people, who no matter how twisted and warped 

the ideology is, willing to commit the most inhuman acts, 

sacrificing not only themselves, mothers bringing their children 

up to die.  Expressing pride at that.   The force of that 

compulsion, of that conviction, is tremendously dangerous.  I 

would suggest to you that we’ve heard a lot of emotional 

statements today.  In my opinion not emanating from our side of, 

of this equation, but I ask you to use your rule of reason.   We as

human beings are all about making nuances, whether we’re 

dealing with our kids, our co-workers, dealing with our 

government.  The human—what we’ve heard repeatedly from our 

opponents, is, extolling you not to try to draw distinctions, not to 

try to rule the rule of reason.

But basically, adopt a rigid…unyielding framework, suggesting 

that anything that deviates from this framework, but degrees of 

coercion, which by the way are practiced in the criminal justice 

system, would absolutely allow most criminals to go free, because 

we’d not be able to suggest them to any psychological coercion, or 

frighten them, or their family members in any way.  That is not 

the way America has gotten to where it is.  This is not the way 

you’re gonna lead your own lives, this is not the way you’re gonna 

lead your professional lives, why should you lead that approach 

as citizens of this great body politic, use the rule of reason, and 

don’t worry about anecdotes about Spanish Inquisition, or the 

Iranian secret police.

I think honestly that we all on this stage tonight have learned

something about each other and I think that we all want to get to 

the same position.  I firmly believe that.  I think that we have a 

different way of going about it.  And we may differ in 

methodology.   I believe on our side and our argument, and I’m 

not making this just based on moral grounds, I’m making this 

from the position of a utilitarian, practical application of what I 

know to work.  And that because we have such a huge deficit in 

our ability to collect solid, good intelligence, I don’t want to waste 

the time trying to find that little dime I mentioned to you on the 

beach.   We don’t have time to do that, the enemy as David 

suggested is very committed.  Bin Laden has issued a fatwa and 

in that fatwa he has declared war on the United States and he 

has said it is the duty of every good Muslim to kill Americans.

Where do they find them.  The question is, how am I going to 

protect you.  How is our government going to protect you.  And 

the best way to do that it seems to me, is what we’ve been 

advocating on this side.  Let’s be clear.  Stress can be defined any 

number of ways.  What we’re talking about are extreme 

measures.   And those extreme measures don’t work…haven’t 

worked, and it sets us up for cataclysmic results, which means, 

as Darius pointed out, revenge of the worst sort.  And we haven’t

seen the worst yet.  We haven’t seen the repercussions of what 

Abu Ghraib has represented and others.  Trust me when I say 

that.

For the motion, Rick Francona.   

RICK FRANCONA 

I was struck by your question, sir, and I really appreciate you 

asking that, about the moral ground, you know, do we lose by not 

adhering to the moral high ground.  Trust me, and I think all of 

us are on the same tier, no one wants to use these techniques as 

a matter of course.  No one enjoys this, from those of us who 

have done this, it’s not a very pleasant experience.  But we don’t 

live in a perfect world.  We didn’t create that world, and it is 

inhabit by people who wanna kill us.  And I’m not sure revenge is 

the factor it’s their stated goal in life, for whatever reason.   Is 

this utilitarian?  Yes.  It’s the mission of, of the intelligence 

community and the armed forces to protect the country, through 

whatever means are—is legally possible.  And when you’re lucky 

enough to get your hands on one of these suspects—and it’s very 

difficult to do, how do you find them.   These are all very good 

points.  Once you get your hands on one, you have to be able to 

get the information you need.  If the rapport-building works, 

great.  If it doesn’t, you’ve gotta be able—
