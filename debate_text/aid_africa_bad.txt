BRIAN LEHRER 

I would now like to introduce Robert Rosenkranz, chairman of 

the Rosenkranz Foundation, the sponsor of Intelligence Squared, 

who will frame tonight’s debate.  Please welcome Bob.   

[APPLAUSE]  

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Well, thank you very much.  With me is Dana Wolfe, our 

executive producer, and it’s our pleasure and honor to welcome 

you to, now, the final, uh, debate of our fall season.  Uh, you 

know, perhaps it’s less expensive to save a human life in sub-

Saharan Africa than anywhere else on the planet.  The vision of 

babies dying from easily preventable diseases just stirs our sense 

of common humanity.  It’s not difficult to, uh, control the spread 

of HIV/AIDS, to reduce iron deficiency anemia with dietary 

supplements, to fight malaria with chemically treated mosquito 

netting.  Each of these strategies offers exceptionally high

benefits, and saves lives, versus the relatively modest costs 

involved. So, how then might aid to Africa do more harm than 

good?  It might do so by further entrenching despotic 

governments at the expense of an energetic private sector.  In 

Africa, many leaders simply use the machinery of the state to 

enrich themselves, their cronies, and their kinsmen.  When 

additional resources are provided to such states, however noble 

the humanitarian goals, a substantial share ends up in the 

pockets of the Swiss bank accounts of the leaders and their 

principal supporters.  The more resources such leaders 

command, the longer they can stay in power.  So, the question 

tonight is, has aid to Africa produced measurable improvements 

in health, nutrition, education, and incomes, or has it simply 

entrenched bad governments and bad ideas?  We have an 

outstanding panel this evening, moderated by Brian Lehrer, the 

award-winning host of New York Public Radio’s thoughtful and 

informative talk show.  It’s my pleasure to welcome Brian back to 

another debate.   

[APPLAUSE]   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Thank you so much for that kind introduction, Bob.  You know, 

on my radio show, I sometimes say that if we in journalism were 

really honest, we would have the same lead story every day.  

Twenty thousand children died today of hunger related causes.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 3. 

 

 

 

Most of those deaths were preventable.  Imagine if twenty 

thousand people were killed once in a terrorist attack.  Or 

airplane crash.  We would turn the world upside down to make 

sure it didn't happen again, as a matter of policy, and we would 

cover it to the ends of the earth, as a matter of news.  But twenty 

thousand children a day, and hardly anyone in the West or the 

North even realizes it, and it never leads the news.  

Disproportionately, those children are in Africa.  So, tonight’s 

topic may not be the sexiest one in this year’s Intelligence 

Squared US series, but I'm certain that it’s the most important. 

With that, I’d like to welcome you to the fifth debate of the second 

Intelligence Squared US series, the resolution being debated 

tonight is: “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good.”  Now, 

let me give you a run down of the evening.  Members of each 

team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument.  

Presentations are limited to eight minutes each.  When opening 

arguments are complete, I will open up the floor to brief 

questions from the audience.  After the Q&A, each debater will 

make a final two minute summation.  As you’ll see, they’ll also 

get a chance to ask each other some questions, and I’ll have 

some follow-ups as well.  And finally, you will vote on tonight’s 

motion with the keypad attached to the armrest of your seat, and 

then I’ll announce your decision on which side carried the day.  

So, let’s start with the pre-debate vote.  Please pick up the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

keypad attached to the arm rest on your left, on your left.  For 

audience members sitting along side the aisle to my right, your 

key pad is attached to the arm rest on your right side next to 

your neighbor’s.  Again, tonight’s resolution is: “Aid to Africa is 

Doing More Harm Than Good.”  And after my prompt please 

press one to vote for the motion that it’s doing more harm than 

good, two to vote against the motion, or three if you are 

undecided.  You may begin voting now.  [PAUSE]  Anyone need 

more time?  Now I know what it felt like to prompt an SAT exam.  

And I will reveal the results of your vote later in the evening.  I’ll 

now introduce the panel, please hold your applause until all six 

are introduced.  For the motion, the president of the Free Africa 

foundation, and Distinguished Economist in Residence at 

American University, George Ayittey.  Professor of Economics at 

New York University, co-director of NYU’s Development Research 

Institution, and non-resident Fellow of the Center for Global 

Development, William Easterly.  And contributing writer to the 

New York Times Magazine, and contributing editor to the New 

Republic, David Rieff.  Against the motion, co-founder and former 

president of Africare, senior advisor to AllAfrica Global Media, 

and president of the business consultancy Lodestar, C. Payne 

Lucas.  Associate director of the Center for Globalization and 

Sustainable Development at the Earth Institute at Columbia 

University, senior macroeconomic advisor in the UN Development

Program’s Africa Bureau, and former deputy director of the UN 

Millenium Project, John McArthur.  And senior fellow at the 

Center for American Progress, and former senior director for 

African affairs at the National Security Council, Gayle Smith.  

[APPLAUSE]  And panelists, when you get down to one minute 

left to go in your eight minutes, I will just say the number one, 

and I will stop you after eight minutes.  So, please be ready to 

conclude at that point.  Gayle Smith gets the first remarks.  

Gayle Smith, please go to the podium.  [BACKGROUND VOICE]  

Oh really?  That’s not what it says here.  Um, OK, so forgive me 

for the confusion, Dana, is it, is it David first?  [BACKGROUND 

VOICE]  OK, and so maybe we should just clear this up now.  Uh, 

who’s second?  [BACKGROUND VOICE]  OK, so they're reversed, 

for/against, and then who’s third?  [BACKGROUND VOICE]  And 

then William Easterly?  And then the last two will be Lucas and 

Ayittey?  [BACKGROUND VOICE] OK. [BACKGROUND VOICE]  In 

that order? [BACKGROUND VOICE]  I'm, I'm just looking at 

what’s in my script.  So, so let’s see, Ayittey, OK, Ayittey and 

Lucas at the end, so let me just confirm the whole thing one more 

time, forgive me folks, um, David Rieff one, Gayle Smith two, 

John McArthur three, William Easterly four, then Ayittey five, 

and Lucas…  [BACKGROUND VOICES]  Yes, we have to go back 

and forth…  [BACKGROUND VOICE]  OK, so wait a minute, 

where’s…  All right.  [LAUGHS]  I thought this was going to be the

easy part.  [LAUGHTER]  Um, if Rieff is first and Smith is second, 

then Easterly is third, that makes sense, and McArthur is fourth, 

and, and Ayittey is fifth, and Lucas is sixth.  So we’ve got it now, 

right?  [APPLAUSE]   Senator Clinton will get the first question…  

No… [LAUGHTER]  David Rieff, please go to the podium.  

[APPLAUSE]  

DAVID RIEFF 

Well, it’s always nice to have a logistics glitch, because it gives 

you a tiny bit more time to think about what you might say of any 

interest.  Um, let me start by saying something that isn't in the 

spirit of these debates, which is that I actually think there’s quite 

a large middle ground on this question, and I'm, you know, I 

don’t mind a good scrap, as any one of you who knows my work 

will know.  But I don’t think that it’s simply a question of saying 

all aid is terrible or, or um, all aid is good, I think to the, you 

know, in the way that I want to invite you to vote for this, uh, 

resolution, it’s that on balance aid is, has done more harm, the 

resolution is well phrased, than good.  It’s not that it’s a great, 

vast, you know, right wing conspiracy, or left wing conspiracy, I 

suppose, in the instance.  Um, it’s not that aid, some aid 

programs don’t work, and have not been shown to work.  The 

problem, I think, and the reason that I, again, invite you to at 

least think hard about supporting this resolution, is that the 

whole discussion of AIDS avoids, makes a kind of moral and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 7. 

 

 

 

historical end run around the problem of politics.  It becomes, if 

you like, a kind of technical question.  There are these suffering 

people, as Mr. Rosenkranz and Mr. Lehrer both described to you.  

We do or we don’t have the modalities to efficiently succor them.  

That is the aid narrative, if you will.  And that is a narrative that, 

largely speaking, deprives the recipients of aid of their agency, 

infantilizes them, and also make sour aid a super-political, extra-

political, moral question.  It becomes a moral imperative, 

therefore we can't talk about the politics, we can't talk about 

whether the UN system actually works, which in my view, 

palpably, it doesn’t.  Um, that’s another, perhaps another debate, 

about which I would be more categorical.  Um, it is, it doesn’t, 

but it most of all doesn’t reckon with the fundamental question 

that people are not saved from outside, people rescue themselves, 

fundamentally.  They can be helped, there’s nothing wrong with 

aid at the margins.  If aid were less ambitious, if aid has less of a 

kind of globalizing, dare I say it, totalitarian program, I would 

support it, as I support emergency relief, which at least in my 

understanding of emergency relief, is not long term development, 

but rapid entry and departure in major, usually war or refugee 

movement emergencies.  The words are unsatisfactory, but that’s 

more or less what it is.  I don’t, I, I’ve worked in that field, and I 

do not think there is anything wrong with it.  On the contrary, I 

think if done properly, if it doesn’t become a stalking horse for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 8. 

 

 

 

some ideological position, say liberal human rights, which I 

would insist is not simply the way the world is at its just, at its 

most just, but an ideological position.  That you, if it does what 

it’s meant to do, which is, as I wrote in a book on this subject, 

offer a bed for a night, but not hope to save people, to transform 

society, et cetera, then I think that, the value of that aid, 

assuming it’s honestly given, and competently given, is 

indisputable.  What is not indisputable by any stretch of the 

imagination is the idea that foreign institutions and governments 

and inter-governmental organizations, notably the European 

Union and the UN system know how to fix other people’s 

difficulties.  The problem with aid, in short, is that it sets itself up 

as the kind of know all and end all.  Now of course aid people will 

tell you this is no, not the case anymore, that was true in the bad 

old days of Lou Preston and the World Bank, it was true when all 

aid workers were, in Africa were, were white, it was true when, if 

you like, the aid system was kind of a direct follow on both of 

religious proselytizing, missionary impulse, and uh, colonialism.  

But the truth of the matter is that that old Texas adage, the man 

with the gold makes the rules, becomes, that definition of the 

golden rule, I mean, is as true today as it was when the French 

flag waved over [UNCLEAR].  And I don’t think it can ever be 

different.  So that what you have with aid by definition is 

outsiders telling people in a place how to do it, and telling them if 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 9. 

 

 

 

they don’t behave satisfactorily, that is the best practices that 

you now see in humanitarianism, if you're not democratic, if you 

are not transparent, fi you don’t do this, that, or the other thing, 

then we will withdraw the aid.  Well, if ever there was an example 

of any unequal form of relations, I would submit to you that 

that’s it, which is why, precisely, in depriving people of their 

agency, aid does more harm than good.  It does some good, I, 

again, I insist on the point that there is middle ground here, but 

it does more harm than good.  Moreover, it does seem to me that 

the emphasis on aid is misplaced, and that if you want to talk 

about what can be done in a place like Africa, but not only in 

Africa, I mean, after all there are other parts of the world that are 

unfavored in this moment in history for many of the same 

reasons, you might talk about fair trade a lot more than talking 

about development aid.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]  

BRIAN LEHRER  

Gayle Smith, you may now take the podium.  

GAYLE SMITH 

Uh, good evening everybody, and David, you were supposed to 

say all aid is bad and should be ended forever to make my life 

much easier.  Um… Thank you for inviting us here this evening, 

and I want to strongly oppose the motion for a number of reasons 

I’ll share with you. First I think it oversimplifies an issue that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 10. 

 

 

 

warrants our attention and our engagement over and above our 

opinions for the simple reason that a lot of lives are at stake, and 

more importantly, dignity is at stake.  And I think the motion 

conflates aid and policy, aid and politics, while overlooking, in 

fact, how complex aid is.  Aid is provided by governments, in the 

case of our own government, we have twenty different pools of 

assistance provided by different agencies, some of them more 

effective than others.  It’s provided by philanthropists, including 

African philanthropists in Africa.  And it is provided by NGO’s.  

it’s a very complex instrument, and to lump it all together, I 

think, is to obviate the, obviate the good it can do.  Third, and I 

think very obvious, it implies that therefore we should stop it.  

Um, and I think that this would be a, a cataclysmic mistake for 

reasons I will get to. Importantly, it overlooks the many 

successes, and you’ll hear more about this tonight, but 

particularly in health and education, and also in areas of 

economic transformation.  Let me give you three examples.  

Ethiopia today has the first ever commodity exchange.  This is 

critically important for farmers to be able to determine what 

prices they can get, and for trade to, to speed up within Ethiopia 

itself and within the region.  It’s a great thing that can transform 

agriculture in that country.  In part it was initially funded by aid.  

Let me give you a second, wireless access in Africa has had a 

huge impact, it’s allowing farmers in rural areas to call and see 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 11. 

 

 

 

what prices are being tomatoes in the market, and cut out the 

middleman that might undercut them and reduce the number of 

dollars they get.  That wireless transformation has come in part 

from the private sector, in part from local governments, and in 

part from aid.  Third, microfinance, something we hear an 

increasing amount about, as transformative in the immediate 

lives of their families and communities.  A lot of that money is 

generated from microfinanced funds themselves but a lot of that 

has also come from aid.   I think that it’s a very out-of-date 

debate, it kind of overlooks the many things that are going on 

now about aid that I think will change it, for example today, the 

majority of country directors for American NGO’s in Africa are 

Africans.   That wasn’t true 10 days ago, that has an 

enormous…impact.  The new awareness about aid among 

Americans, about a civil society in Africa, is forcing a new 

transparency which is critical, to hold aid providers and aid 

recipients to account.   Dictators were many times supported in 

the past and—and I wish I could say they would never be 

supported again, uh, we can talk about the elections later but for 

now, I think we’ve seen an important transformation, consider 

Zimbabwe.  Where Robert Mugabe I believe is trying to run the 

country into the ground.   The bulk of foreign aid to Zimbabwe 

now is going to civil-society institutions, that are trying and doing 

a very good job of protecting the institutions that can serve that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 12. 

 

 

 

country well, in the future.   It also obviates and overlooks an 

important debate that’s going on now that I think is, is critical for 

our future, and gets to a point David made about aid and politics, 

there’s no question that politics has affected aid and aid has 

often been driven by politics.  The emerging debate now among 

policy-makers, among NGO’s, among Africans, uh, among many, 

is that foreign aid in the case of the United States needs to be 

elevated, number one, so that it is on par with some of our other 

foreign-policy institutions.   But more importantly, protected, 

from the politics that would drive it in the wrong direction.  That 

in other words we need to learn how and move towards ring-

fencing development assistance, so that it can’t be used…for 

reasons other than development.   I think to, to sug—to vote for a 

motion that said aid—aid is doing more harm than good, uh, 

undercuts that very important debate.  The last point I would 

make is that I—I think the reason this, this motion is flawed is 

because at the end of the day development matters.   And at the 

end of the day, the United States as a government, citizens of the 

United States, private companies in the United States, 

philanthropists in the United States, as around the rest of the 

world, I believe, have a responsibility and an interest in 

promoting development.   I think it is a moral interest, it’s an 

economic interest, I think it’s a security interest, I think it has 

everything to do as well with our leadership.  So I would also say 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 13. 

 

 

 

in conclusion, that if we conclude that aid is doing more harm 

than good, and therefore we should get rid of it, what’s our 

alternative.   Will we use the military as our primary means of 

doing our bit to contribute to Africa’s development in the future?  

I hope you will agree with me that that would not be the right 

way to go.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

BRIAN LEHRER 

A very—  A very efficient panel so far, I haven’t had to throw 

anyone off the podium yet.  William Easterly, your turn for your 

opening remarks.    

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

Good evening.  I wanna talk to you about two tragedies that 

have…are covered by this debate.  The first tragedy we’ve already 

heard about, that there’s a lot of unnecessary human suffering in 

Africa.  That for example, children’s lives could be saved for a 12-

cent dose of anti-malaria medication, could save them from dying 

from malaria.   And that is in—indeed a tragedy that children are 

dying for lack of a 12-cent medicine.  Everyone here on the 

panels agrees that’s a tragedy and feels compassion at this 

enormous tragedy.   There’s also a second tragedy and that’s—

this is a tragedy that we hear a lot less about.  And this is the 

tragedy that we’ve already spent as official donors $600 billion in 

aid to Africa over the past 45 years, and after all that children are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 14. 

 

 

 

still not getting the 12-cent medicines.   So there were still 

between one and three million deaths from malaria last year.  So 

aid would be a great thing if it worked.  But the sad tragedy is 

that—and this is really one of the, the scandals of our generation 

is that mo—money meant for the most desperate people in the 

world, is simply not reaching them.   $600 billion in aid to Africa 

over the past 45 years, and over that ti—over that time period 

there’s basically been zero rise in living standards.  Zero rise in 

incomes in Africa.  The money is simply not reaching the people 

for whom it is intended.  And yet, the advocates of aid always 

focus their energies simply talking about this number, about how 

much we spend in aid, as if that in itself were an achievement of 

some kind.   This goes back, it—every generation calls for an 

increase in aid to try to resolve the problem of development.  It 

goes back to an advisor to John F. Kennedy named Walt Rostow 

who called for doubling foreign aid way back in 1960.  In 1973 

World Bank president McNamara once again called for doubling 

of foreign aid.  Actually this is something that I noticed in my 

research which, uh, as a professor you’re always kinda proud 

when you discover an empirical irregularity that really fits the 

data perfectly.   And that is that when people call for an increase 

in aid they always call for exactly double.  [LAUGHTER]  It’s 

always exactly 100 percent increase.  Never, you know, 117 

percent or 83—it—it’s amazing.   So this has continued to the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 15. 

 

 

 

present, the 2005 G-8 summit called for doubling aid to Africa.  

Barack Obama’s called for doubling aid to Africa, Jeffrey Sachs 

has called for doubling aid to Africa.   Uh, even our President 

George W. Bush called for and has already implemented an—an 

increase in US aid of 50 percent.  I did worry for a moment that 

that didn’t fit my law, but, uh, I checked with the White House 

staff and they explained to me that he thought 50 percent was 

double.  [LAUGHTER]  So…  [APPLAUSE]   So what—what—what 

good does it do to focus on the amount spent, uh, this obsession 

with the amount spent on aid, if the balance of the evidence 

suggests that the, the money is not reaching the poor--sure, 

there is the occasional success, which we will hear about from 

time to time tonight, but the balance of the evidence is simply 

that, $600 billion went into Africa and income did not rise.  So 

where did the money go?  Well, unfortunately a lot of it went to 

corrupt rulers, to corrupt and autocratic rulers.  Today, despite 

all the talk of action against corruption, two-thirds of all aid 

today goes to rulers who have the worst rating on corruption.  

Two-thirds of aid going to corrupt rulers.  This is actually getting 

worse over time.   There’s no evidence of any sort of post-Cold 

War break, in which, you know, in the bad old days aid when to 

corrupt dictators and now it goes to good guys.  And by the way, 

uh, Gayle, Ethiopia is a good example, the, the ruler of Ethiopia 

is a guy named Meles who is a dictator who shot down unarmed 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 16. 

 

 

 

demonstrators in the street, this is a guy who has been a darling 

of the aid community.   This is not the kind of aid that 

accomplishes good, this is the kind of aid that does more harm 

than  good.  And in fact, aid has gone into states that 

subsequently collapsed into warlord anarchy.   There was a lot of 

aid that went into Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, the Democratic 

Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, even up to the moment when the 

genocide broke out in Rwanda, there was still aid money going 

into Rwanda, in fact even after the genocide broke out the French 

were still supplying the Rwandan government, committing the 

genocide with aid dollars.  Some of it military aid, obscenely 

enough.   And so I say to you that aid, uh, and this is borne out 

by his—by statistical evidence, that aid worsens corruption, aid 

blocks democracy, aid is an obstacle to the freeing of Africans 

from predatory rulers…   And I think we have no choice but to, to 

vote for the motion tonight, we, we cannot be satisfied with this 

record of aid, that has promised so much and accomplished so 

little.  We must condemn the sorry record of aid for the sake of 

Africa, and for ourselves.  It’s simply unacceptable that a system 

which is supposed to have the best intentions, is simply making 

things worse rather than better.   

[APPLAUSE]   

BRIAN LEHRER  

John McArthur, your opening remarks.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 17. 

 

 

 

JOHN MCARTHUR 

Thank you, and thank you to everyone for joining tonight and, 

uh, thanks to members on all sides of the panel.  I think it’s 

important to go back to the point that David Rieff made of 

understanding, even he of course supported rejecting the motion, 

‘cause it’s so strong, and, uh, ambiguous as to what it even 

means.   If we think about what aid actually achieves, and what 

it doesn’t achieve, we have to make sure we avoid the, uh, 

spurious correlations that have been mentioned tonight, just 

because two things happened at the same time doesn’t mean one 

is responsible of course for the other.   But we also have to think 

about the framing of this statement, which is about the present 

tense, not the past.  We’re not here to discuss and debate 

President Mobutu tonight.  We’re here to talk about whether aid 

is doing more harm than good.   And on that, there are four basic 

points I think we need to keep in mind.  The first, is that it’s often 

understood or misunderstood, that bad governments and 

corruption are responsible for Africa’s poverty, and singularly 

responsible.   Professor Ayittey often refers to the cheetahs of the 

new generation and the hippos of the last generation.  Well, what 

about the cheetahs of the new development generation, the 

cheetahs of the new aid generation that are re—producing 

remarkable results across the board.   When we actually look at 

the statistical evidence, as Professor Easterly does and I do and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 18. 

 

 

 

others, we see that, even when we compare governments with 

equal levels of good governance, we see that Africa on average 

grows about 2 percent per year slower than other developing 

countries around the world.  Why is that?  Why is it that, 

countries like Ghana and Senegal have better transparency 

international ratings than China and India, while it still grows so 

slowly while China and India take off?   Why is it that Vietnam 

grows so quickly, while it has governance ratings so far below 

Tanzania, or Burkina Faso?  It’s because of the issues of disease, 

it’s the lack of infrastructure, it’s the lack of education, it’s the 

terrible legacy of colonialism.  But it’s about much, much more 

than bad governments.  There’s no question that a bad 

government can drive a country off a cliff, but aid is about 

tackling those very practical challenges of health, education and 

infrastructure, if it’s to be done properly.   Now, Professor 

Easterly discussed the $600 billion of aid to Africa.  That’s the 

second myth is that this is vast sums down the drain.  How much 

is $600 billion if we think about it per African, per year.  If you 

divide that over all the years over all the Africans, by my estimate 

it’s maybe $28 per African per year.   That’s all the money going 

down the drain.  And then, there’s the third issue, well what we 

do we get for it, we’ve heard that nothing, nothing has been 

achieved.  Well let’s talk about some of those successes.  There’s 

the smallpox eradication that happened around the world, of

course, thanks to, I have to say the UN’s World Health 

Organization that set up the target, set up a Smallpox 

Eradication Unit, and got rid of the disease.   There’s the fight 

against AIDS.  In 2002 we had perhaps 50,000 people on anti-

retroviral treatment in Africa.  Thanks to the creation of the 

global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, and the US President’s 

Emergency Program for AIDS Relief, we now have well over a 

million people on anti-retroviral treatment within just five years.   

And for those of us who were in the trenches five, seven years 

ago, this was considered impossible.  Impossible.  We have 

throughout Africa primary enrollment rates since 1991 alone up 

20 percentage points.   Just last week we had the news that 

UNICEF, the Red Cross and others had cut measles death in 

Africa by 91 percent, between 2000 and 2006, from  nearly 

400,000 people a year, children, to 40,000 a year.  They actually 

set a target to do that by 2010 and they were four years ahead of 

schedule.   Of the 20,000 deaths a day, that our moderator 

pointed out at the beginning, those 360,000 are 1,000 a day of 

the to—the total.  That was aid backing it.  That was UNICEF, 

that was WHO, that was the American Red Cross, that was the 

Center for Disease Control working governments and the 

government national plans, and they got the job done.   In 

Malawi, many of you might have seen the New York Times front-

page story on the weekend, where aid supported the national

government to implement the plan that it wanted to implement, 

to get fertilizer and seeds to farmers, and in just two years, we 

saw a full country, one of the poorest countries on the planet,  

with a better governance rating than many countries growing 

much faster than it, double its food production, from one ton per 

hectare, to two tons per hectare, and it’s now actually an aid 

donor in the region.  So we have to reject these myths, we also 

need to reject the one about trade, the fourth one, that it’s trade, 

not aid.   We all want trade, we all want aid, and we all want 

market development, and we wanna focus on the practical things 

that can be done to reduce poverty and to support the countries 

to reduce poverties on their own terms.   So let me just conclude 

by saying first, just screaming governance and corruption is 

simply not the case.  It’s too simplistic and it ob—obscures the 

underlying truth of disease, lack of infrastructure, lack of 

education in Africa.   Second, the scary big numbers that we 

often hear, are often quite tiny, in fact minuscule, when we think 

of them in terms of the real people in Africa, and what they’re 

trying to achieve.  Third, we see amazing successes each and 

every day, such as the eradication of measles, when practical 

strategies are set to achieve practical targets, no politics, just 

getting the job done.   So it’s with these three points in mind that 

I urge the house to reject the simplistic and misleading 

proposition that aid to Africa does more harm than good, and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 21. 

 

 

 

more importantly, let’s join together to focus on the practical task 

of ensuring that aid builds on the successes, to keep doing as 

much good as it possibly can.  Thank you.  

[APPLAUSE]   

BRIAN LEHRER  

At this point in the debate I’m supposed to ask a few follow-up 

questions.  So, William Easterly, John McArthur…just listed 

some very specific examples of what he said are very significant 

successes, smallpox eradication, a million people on anti-

retrovirals who have HIV, once thought impossible.  The UN and 

others cut measles deaths by 91 percent.   What he said about 

Malawi.  Are these not significant successes, when you said 

signif—si—wait—when you said success stories are rare?   

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

Uh, well, one sign of the rarity of success stories is that I keep 

hearing the same ones over and over again.  The, uh, the 

smallpox example is given, is given so often and it’s—it happened 

so long ago that, I think it should be consigned to, uh, to history 

at this point, uh…   I’m not—I don’t—I’m not going to say that 

everything fails, that there are no successes, small—smallpox 

was a success, uh…  But the fact that we keep citing the same 

thing over and over again suggests just how few successes there 

have been, the measles success,  unfortunately was, until this 

new announcement was actually on the ledger side of failure.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 22. 

 

 

 

Uh, the measle—cheap and inexpensive measles vaccination had 

been available for decades, and yet had not—had not been used 

to save millions of lives from measles.  So I’m not sure I would 

count that as much of a success at this point.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

But is the answer to that, given what has taken place, just to 

stop aid?   

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

No, I’m not…I’m not sure that we’re voting tonight on whether to 

stop aid, I think we’re voting on whether the existing aid system 

has done more harm than good, the, uh, the existing aid system I 

think we’re arguing is ineffective, it’s—has bad political effects in 

propping up corrupt autocrats.   And I think that system does 

more harm than good, uh, I, I could imagine other aid systems 

that would do some good, that could save lives.  If aid agencies 

were held accountable for results, which they are not now.  If 

they were held accountable for failure which they are not now.   

But we don’t have that system at the present, we’re voting on the 

system we have now and that’s the system that has failed us 

unfortunately.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

So, Gayle Smith, maybe there is a seed of common ground.  

Maybe we each agree that the aid system that we have now is not 

the perfect aid system, that there are successes, that there are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 23. 

 

 

 

failures, and there are things that perhaps all of you could agree 

on, to make things much better.  Might that be the case?   

GAYLE SMITH 

Well, I—I think aid systems can be, uh… improved, no question, I 

think that one of the problems though with this argument is that 

it suggests that none of that is happening.  I think there are other 

successes out there, uh, John didn’t mention, uh, HIV—or did 

mention, excuse me, HIV and AIDS which I think is significant 

and the fact that,  success in measles is later than it should’ve 

been, uh—  I—I don’t think therefore writes it off as a success, 

but I think we’ve also got a problem with terms here and I think 

this is a bit too important, uh, to be slipshod with.   For example, 

when you talk about $600 billion in aid, that conflates 

development aid and a lot of aid that was given for reasons 

having nothing to do with development, let’s not pretend for a 

minute that the aid the United States gave to Zaire during the 

Cold War was given for development.   Everybody knows it 

wasn’t, so to hold it accountable for achieving development aims, 

I think is—  

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

And the U—US has no—   

GAYLE SMITH 

—let me finish, please let me finish—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 24. 

 

 

 

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

—strategic motives, at all now—?   

GAYLE SMITH 

Please let me finish.  My point is, that that aid was not given for 

development purposes, and you are judging it on the basis of 

whether or not it achieved development purposes.  I suspect we 

would agree that the purposes for which it was given, were not 

very good.   But I don’t think it’s, it’s right to suggest that money 

that’s given for security reasons should be held to development 

outcomes, second, I—I think you’re suggesting that the fact that 

poverty still exists in epidemic proportions in Africa, is because of 

aid.   What about the terms of trade.  What about commodity 

prices.  What about war.  What about drought.  What about 

governments that may be…ineffective.  What about colonialism 

and the Cold War, I think the notion that the fact that poverty 

still exists in Africa because of aid, is way oversimplified, last, I—

I—   Or, excuse me, that, that two-thirds of aid goes to corrupt 

rulers.  The example I used of the commodity exchange in 

Ethiopia, is not aid to the government of Ethiopia, it’s a private-

sector initiative.  So I—I think you need to be careful about 

suggesting…that two-thirds of aid goes to corrupt rulers, that’s 

not in fact the case today—  

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

Two-thirds of official aid.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 25. 

 

 

 

GAYLE SMITH 

And la—no, that’s not true of official aid, an increasing amount of 

official aid goes to non-government entities and private-sector 

groups, lastly, I think there’s a contradiction here that we may 

wanna tease out.  I—I think I heard David say that aid is flawed 

because it’s designed to develop people from afar.   But Bill’s 

arguing that aid is flawed, because it has not developed people 

from afar.  And I think there’s a contradiction there.  It’s, it’s 

wrong because it aims to develop other people, which, I mean I 

would actually agree with David that that’s not something we can 

do.  But Bill, it seems to me you’re suggesting that it’s wrong 

because it has failed to do just that.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

David Rieff, if I heard you correctly you said, that…it never can be 

different.  I think I heard from William Easterly, that it could be 

different if there were a better aid system.  Do you think the 

whole notion of aid to Africa as a means of improving standards 

of living, is an impossible notion?   

DAVID RIEFF 

Well, what I think is impossible is the notion of aid as the 

centerpiece of development, uh, in Africa, that’s—that—I mean 

my view, for what it’s worth, is simply that, the whole system of 

international development is structured around various 

modalities of aid.  That’s why I brought up the trade issue which 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 26. 

 

 

 

I insist is a real issue despite what Mr. McArthur said, because 

the terms of trade are stacked against Africa.   To use only one 

example, they’re not only stacked against Africa, they’re stacked 

against other parts of the world as well.  But, you know, to put it, 

you know, very bluntly that, you know, that, this is a—the 

system of trade at the moment, is in an age of rising commodity 

prices, nonetheless, uh,  structured so that the actual producers 

of commodities get screwed by the, by the system, the 

international system of trade.  So, my view is simply that, by 

making development aid from the outside, whether it’s national 

governments, or inter-governmental institutions, the centerpiece 

of what you’re doing means it’s always going to fail.   And I think 

that we’re— the thing that troubles me about the, if you like, the, 

the—those arguing against this motion is false—I, I, I mean 

obviously, somebody who grew up—I grew up in the ‘60s, and I 

remember leftists of my type, uh, saying at the time, well, of 

course the Soviet Union’s no good and Cuba’s no good and… 

China’s no good and Korea’s no good and… Albania’s obviously 

no good.   But that’s actually existing Communism.  What there 

is, there’s this wonderful Communism that we could somehow 

create.  And I think the lesson, this is a point made by the critic 

of development, Colin Leys, in his famous book, that at a certain 

point you have to say, you had to say, even if you remain—if you 

were on the left, and I remain on the left, uh, I wanna be clear 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 27. 

 

 

 

about that, uh—  [LAUGHTER]  In this call above all others.   Um, 

but, uh…but the, at a certain point, people on the left had to 

admit that this was a lie.  That there was not actually existing 

Communism and ideal Communism, the—what actually existed 

was Communism.  Period.  That’s—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

John—  John McArthur, um, briefly and then we’re gonna 

continue with the, the opening remarks of the panelists who 

haven’t spoken yet.  Um…  Do the successes that you 

listed…equate, really, to significant successes, or exceptions as 

William Easterly contends, if some of his other stats are true and 

two-thirds of aid is gobbled up by corrupt, uh, dictators, and 

$600 billion spent, and more or less the standard of living on the 

continent has not gone up.    

JOHN MCARTHUR 

I think—I’d like to make a few quick points, first on the trade just 

‘cause that’s come up, I think it’s important to understand that if 

the so-called Doha trade agreement comes through the estimates 

are that Africa might benefit about a billion dollars per year.   

That’s mainly an issue of cotton exporters, it’s actually not an 

issue for many—most of the other commodities, and that’s a 

billion dollars which is quite small, when spread across 700 

million people—    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 28. 

 

 

 

BRIAN LEHRER  

But wait a minute, David Rieff, is that aid, or is that something 

else, trade?   

DAVID RIEFF 

Well, the disagreement is, if you’re saying that—  My emphasis on 

trade, John, is not the Doha Round, I mean if, if you’re, if—we 

agree about the Doha Round.   

JOHN MCARTHUR 

I’m just saying that the, the trade is good, but it’s not huge in 

quantitative terms, to… Bill Easterly I would say, I don’t know 

what you expect to buy for 30 bucks per person.  You think—I 

say a, a million people, 1.3 million people on anti-retrovirals in 

five years and you say huh, old story.   I say, 360,000 kids a year 

not dying, you say, huh, old story.  I say 20 percentage point 

boost in primary enrollment in barely a decade, you say huh, old 

story.  I really don’t know what you expect to buy for $30 per 

person.   These are practical things, I’m not defending, as I said 

at the outset, everything that’s been done in aid policy, I’m not 

defending all of the machinery.  Professor Easterly and I I think 

would agree on nine out of 10 issues, and we have in many 

instances on what needs to be done, to actually improve the aid 

system.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Professor Easterly, the one million people on AIDS anti-



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 29. 

 

 

 

retrovirals, no big deal?    

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

No, of course, it’s prolonging their lives, that’s great, I salute that, 

uh, but, let’s—   

JOHN MCARTHUR 

Is that harm or is that good?   

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

That’s good.  [LAUGHS]  But let’s, let’s be clear about these—let’s 

be clear about these numbers, for many African countries, aid is 

20 percent of their GDP.  If they had invested that—  

JOHN MCARTHUR 

That’s $300 per capita, it’s 40 bucks—   

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

If they had invested that, then the ex— expectation of the aid 

advocates was that they would’ve had economic growth.  And that 

simply is what did not happen.  It did— it did not get invested, we 

did not have growth.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Now, part two of the opening statements.  Back to the hard part, 

let’s see if I can keep figuring out the order here.  George Ayittey, 

it’s your turn for opening remarks.   

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Hello, well first of all, uh, let me thank the Intelligence Squared, 

uh, for having this debate.  And, I personally as an African, I find 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 30. 

 

 

 

this very amusing that I can see proponents for and against, uh, 

aid.   And I think— those of us on this side, really believe that, 

you have to separate the humanitarian impulse, from the record 

of aid itself.  I mean on the humanitarian impulse, we all wanna 

help, as a matter of fact, a lot of people here say that it is the 

moral obligation of the rich to help the poor.   But the record on 

aid has been a disaster.  And that’s what a lot of us do, of us on 

this particular side of the table, want to change.  And what we’re 

saying is that, look, the current system of aid harms Africa.  And I 

think John McArthur said that, no, uh, there, there, there are a 

new group of people…   He calls them the cheetahs, I disagree.  

And, uh, he believes that, aid can be reformed and help the 

African people.  But…fact of the matter is, more than 600 billion 

has been poured into Africa since 1960, with nothing to show for 

it.   Except the marketing of black elephants and crumbled 

infrastructure and decaying buildings.  There are a couple of 

misconceptions about aid that we need to clear up.  First of all, 

aid—foreign aid is not free.  It is a very soft loan.  Which is given 

to a government.  On—at concessional rates.   Now the second 

thing about aid is that, aid is tied.  80 percent of US aid to Africa 

is spent right here in—in America.  On American contractors, 

American suppliers, and so forth.  French aid is even worse.  

[LAUGHTER]   When China gives you aid they don’t just send you 

materials, they also bring in the labor, and, and, uh, materials 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 31. 

 

 

 

and, you know, set up towns for their workers for example.  

Now…one of the things which has been missing in this piece, is 

that, nobody asked…whom at all do we want to help in Africa, 

nobody asked that question.  It is assumed, that if we give aid—if 

we gave aid to Africa, automatically, it will help, lift the people out 

of poverty.  And this is one of the reasons, it’s one of the fallacies 

of aid.  It’s one of the reasons why it’s so difficult to come up with 

success stories, of aid in Africa.  We can find countries, that the 

US aid has been able to reform politically, we can’t find countries 

where US aid has been able to reform politi—economically.  Right 

now as we speak…out of the 54 African countries, only 16 of 

them are democratic.  Less than 10 can be characterized as 

economic success stories.  Forget about intellectual freedom.  

That is in the Stalinist era.  What Africa needs, and as a matter of 

fact I testified before the Senate of Canada this past June.   And 

what I laid before them, yes, they want to help Africa.  But they 

themselves, came up with a report, Canadian report, Senate 

report, of 40 years of Canadian aid failure in Africa.  What to do.  

Now we’re not suggesting, now don’t help Africa.  But if you want 

to help Africa, folks, please, for Pete’s sake, ask the Africans what 

they want.  Don’t assume that you know better than the Africans.   

What Africans want, three things, reform, reform, reform.  Reform 

the abominable political systems, reform the abominable 

economic systems, and intellectual systems, give Africans the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 32. 

 

 

 

freedom, so that they themselves can decide what is good for 

them.   Such freedoms are lacking in Africa.  So to me, this 

debate really…is, currently, the aid system is rotten, it’s not 

helping the African people.  And if you want to help the African 

people, what I’ll propose to you, and this is what our side is 

coming up with, is smart aid.  Smart aid is that which empowers 

the African people to instigate reform from within.  The ruling 

elites are not interested in reform.  We all know what the 

problems are, bloated bureaucracies.  Corruption!  We want to 

trim government expenditures in Africa.  The elites are not 

interested, you ask them…to cut government spending.  And they 

will set up a Ministry of Less Government Spending.  

[LAUGHTER]   Now this is the hippo generation, they are not 

interested in reform.  You ask them…to curb corruption, and like 

in Kenya, they’ll set up an Anti-Corruption Commission.  But 

then, when it snakes too close, they sack the, uh, corruption 

czar, and shut the whole thing down.   Africans know what they 

want.  And if you want to better help the African people, ask 

them.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

BRIAN LEHRER  

C. Payne Lucas, your opening remarks.    

PAYNE LUCAS 

Good evening.  For a moment, I thought George was describing 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 33. 

 

 

 

America.  [LAUGHTER]  You know, I come from Washington D.C. 

where last week, week before last, $40 million was stolen by 

some employees inside the government.  And when Bill talked 

about 600 billion, I thought about how much of the six—how 

much money do we spend in Iraq and Afghanistan every month.   

I mean I…I’m, I’m stunned, that we are suggesting that all we 

need to do, is get the bags of money, take ‘em to Africa, give ‘em 

to the Africans, and let them decide and bypass the government.  

Well let me tell you something this evening, I don’t care how you 

vote, that’s not going to happen.   ‘Cause we want to know, 

what’s happening to our money.  Everything is changing.  That’s 

one thing about AID, it’s always changing.  Let me say one thing.  

Sese Seko Mobutu.  Every time we talk about corruption, we talk 

about Mr. Mobutu, who stole millions of dollars in the Congo.   

[00:57:07:02]  Well, why shouldn’t he have stolen them.  We were 

in the Congo to start with to stop Communism.  Not to help the 

poor people of the Congo.  We were not there for that purpose.  

We know that.  We wanted the Congo’s precious metals, and we 

wanted to keep the Russians.  So he is Mr. Corruption.   And if I 

gave a test tonight to the people in this room, of how many 

corrupt politicians or corrupt states in Africa, not very many 

people here would pass, I didn’t know we had so many countries 

doing so well until Mr. Ayittey’d spoken.   We got 16 countries, 

got 18 countries—doing well.  That is an enormous track record.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 34. 

 

 

 

Now for every Mobutu, that you have in Africa, you have some 

non-Bu—Mobutus.  I wish for example, that President Mandela 

could’ve been here tonight, to have heard these remarks.   He 

would’ve grabbed some of the people by their throat and said, 

what do you mean!  We know people who’ve attacked Bono 

for…for his notion that we ought to be digging wells all over 

Africa.  That people walk two and three miles a day in search of 

water, not in search of water, in search of bad water.  We need all 

the help we can get, why do we turn to America, because we are a 

generous nation.  We know President Bush said when he was in 

the campaign the last time, he said, we’re not going to engage in 

nation-building.  We’re gonna let the people do their own thing.   

But when we got to…Iraq, we found out, we’d better start doing 

some nation-building.  And on the one day we hated the UN and 

the next day we were begging UNDP to come and help us solve 

the problems…in Iraq.   One of the reasons that we have to help 

Africa, and I know we discounted all these programs we had over 

the years, small pox, we discounted onchocerciasis, thousands 

and thousands of Africa, Africans involved in river blindness, we 

found a cure for it, working with the private sector, and working 

with AID.  So, millions of acres, acres of land have been liberated 

because we solved this disease.  So, let me just say, for every 

corrupt politician in Africa, we have a history of some great 

politicians in Africa.  There was a man who headed up a country 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 35. 

 

 

 

by the name of Tanzania, his name was Nyerere.  I can't recall 

the new president of Tanzania, but we’re talking about his work 

in Tanzania, and how this country is moving forward.  We had a 

place called Liberia, and for use we propped up Tubman in 

Liberia, and people said, when is it going to change?  One thing 

about Africa, it is capable of change, and that’s what we’re 

working with.  We now have a woman in Liberia by the name of 

Johnson Sirleaf, who walked into a living hell, and now is going 

to build a nation state.  She will not be able to build it without 

the help of the American community and the development 

community. We have a chance to do something in Liberia, one of 

our own quote, unquote, colonies.  Why do we do it, why do we 

work with Americans, why do we do things in Africa, because we 

know how to get things done.  Sometime we start out the wrong 

way, but almost invariably at the end of the day we end up in the 

right way.  Then they say, well you know, we can't find the, we 

can't find any good politicians in Africa.  In Mozambique there 

was a man by the name of Joaquim Chissano.  This year he was 

voted five million dollar peace prize for the way he ran his 

country with good governance.  I remember when people were 

giving him hell, but he said, wait, I’ll prove to you that we can run 

this country and bring help to the people of this country.  So he 

got a five million dollar prize for doing things right.  We also know 

about our president in Mali, who’s doing a great job in Mali.

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 36. 

 

 

 

These things don’t just happen.  Our ambassadors and our aid 

agencies, they work night and day trying to make all these things 

happen.  This is a complicated world we live in. Africa got fifty-

three countries, eight hundred million people, and by the way, 

don’t discount colonialism, don’t say that we want to go back to 

the old days when Africa had free trade, and everything was 

wonderful.  In the old days everything was not wonderful.  In the 

old days people were sick and often they did not know it.  And 

then some people make the arguments that, why are we involved 

in anti-retrovirals?  We should have a program of treatment, of, of 

prevention.  Sure we should have a program of prevention.  But if 

your family, they have HIV/AIDS they want some of that anti-

retroviral.  So we gotta do that.  And what we are saying here 

tonight, we have to change all the things that we say.  No, aid is 

not right, but we have an opportunity to change it.  One thing we 

have learned over the years, our programs must be owned by 

Africans, they must be African led, they must be sustainable, and 

they must be accountable.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

One minute.   

PAYNE LUCAS 

In the age of technology, we don’t need to wait two years to find a 

crook in Africa, our computers can find them almost overnight.  

So when we apply the technology, we can identify the crooks.

And let me tell you something else, 9/11 will be coming back 

unless we respond sooner than later, and if we don’t respond to 

Africa and their needs, the Chinese will, because the Chinese are 

coming, and they don’t ask questions about democracy, and good 

governance, and freedom of the press, and justice, they just want 

the raw materials.   

[APPLAUSE]  

BRIAN LEHRER  

C. Payne Lucas, in telling the story of the thievery of government 

money in the United States at the beginning, did you mean to 

suggest that corruption in the United States is the equivalent of 

the corruption in much of Africa?  And by saying for every 

Mobutu you also have more great politicians, do you mean to 

differ greatly from George Ayittey’s estimate that of the fifty-four 

countries in Africa, only sixteen of them are democracies, I hope I 

got those numbers right… 

PAYNE LUCAS 

No, I don’t, I mean, I was surprised that we have sixteen 

democracies in Africa.  I don’t think Nigeria was exactly a 

democracy under president Obarsaso [sic], Obasanjo, but I have 

to really give him a great deal of respect for the fact that he 

managed a nation of a hundred and fifty million people without 

any great fall down of war and decadence.  And on top of that, he 

appointed a woman by the name of Minister Ngozi, who went out

and looked for corruption.  So when you start to think like that 

and change like that, the message is getting through.  You don't 

ignore Nigeria.  And when you start to talk about aid, let’s not 

forget, when you talk about six hundred billion dollars of that, 

how much of that went to Egypt and Israel.  We have, we have to 

support those places because we have strategic interests in those 

places.  And sometime aid itself is, is not related, it’s related to 

maintaining our relationships   So those cannot be ignored.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

George Ayittey, you said that Africans want three things, reform, 

reform, and reform.  Economic reform, political reform, and 

intellectual reform.  Do the United States or the United Nations 

have a role to play in that, in your opinion?   

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Well, first of all, let me address some of the comments made by 

C. Payne Lucas.  And that is, look, take Nigeria, for example, 

please do not minimize the issue of corruption.  It is a very 

serious problem that we have in Africa.  Take Nigeria for example.  

Between 1970 and 2000, more than four hundred and fifty billion 

in oil revenue flowed into Nigerian company coffers.  Now, 

according to Nuhu Ribadu, the chairman of Nigeria’s anti-

corruption commission, of that amount of money, four hundred 

and [UNCLEAR] billion was stolen by Nigeria’s military rulers.   

That’s a huge amount of money.  Sure, certainly we can point to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 39. 

 

 

 

Ngozi, who has been a reformer, but what did the Obasanjo 

regime do to reward her?  They sacked her.  And now.  If you look 

across Africa as a whole, the African Union itself says that 

corruption alone costs Africa one hundred and forty-eight billion 

dollars every year.  Now, that’s more than five times the foreign 

aid Africa receives form all sources.  So, the issue…as a matter of 

fact, Africa doesn’t need aid.  The aid resources Africa needs can 

be found right there in Africa.   

PAYNE LUCAS 

Well, I want to make clear, if you think that, uh, this corruption 

in Nigeria grew out of, uh, Obasanjo’s regime, I think you're 

wrong.  

GEORGE AYITTEY 

I didn't say that.   

PAYNE LUCAS 

We all, we all know Sani Abacha was the person who stole all the 

money in Nigeria, but the Nigerians, we got rid of him too, didn't 

we?  Every time we find corrupt politicians— 

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Sani Abacha was worth five billion.  Babangida, eight billion, you 

can go all the way back.  Now, this didn't start, OK, recently, is 

start all the way back since the 1970’s.  

PAYNE LUCAS 

Well I, I don’t disagree with you.  You’ve got to remember one

thing, in this country, this country alone, and in the world, 

Korean, and Tehran, and Japan, and from the Civil War all the 

way up to Teddy Roosevelt, corruption was rampant in this 

country, but these countries still grow, they still became powerful 

countries.  Corruption alone does not destroy our country, it’s 

the amount of corruption.  We’ll never eliminate it completely, 

but we can set in motion the conditions that will help eliminate 

this terrible thing.  

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Please, let the Africans— 

PAYNE LUCAS 

And that’s why the Africans now have played at something called 

knee pads too— 

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Let the Africans decide for themselves how bad corruption is.  

And that sort of comparative analysis doesn’t help us.  If you try 

to place corruption within Washington context, for example, 

suddenly there is corruption, um, in DC, in DC government, and 

now the latest toll is that, you know, forty-three million dollars 

have disappeared because of tax fraud.  But please, don’t 

compare that to Africa.  Let the Africans themselves determine 

the incidence of corruption and how important it is to them.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

And briefly, professor Ayittey, on the question of the role in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 41. 

 

 

 

reform that the US or UN would have to play?  

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Well, the United States, the, um, World Bank, United Nations can 

be helpful, um, in reforming, try to help Africa reform.  But in the 

past they’ve been more of a hindrance.  And that is one of the, 

look, if you want to reform Africa, there’s six basic institutions 

that you need.  Number one, you need an independent and free 

media.  That’s the first critical institution.  Americans take their 

media for granted.  The second institution that you need is an 

independent judiciary for the rule of law. The third institution 

that you need is an independent electoral commission.  Five, 

four, I'm sorry, you need a, um, independent, you need to have 

an independent central bank.  And then you want to have a 

neutral and professional armed forces and an efficient civil 

service.  Give Africans these six institutions and it would do most 

of the cleaning out of Africa.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

All right, hang, hang on, we need to, we need to move on to the 

next person.  You’ll get a, you’ll get a chance.  I am now ready to 

announce the results of the pre-debate vote.  Before the debate, 

twenty-four percent of you voted for the motion, “Aid to Africa has 

Done More Harm Than Good.”  Thirty-four percent of you voted 

against the motion, and the winner in the pre-debate vote, the 

winner in the pre-debate vote was undecided with forty-two

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

percent.  This is an open-minded audience.  Now comes the fun 

part.  Where each of the panelists will have an opportunity to ask 

a question of the opposing side.  Gayle Smith, you get the first 

question.  

GAYLE SMITH 

Oh!  OK.  Um… Do you honestly, and any of you can take this, 

uh, your, your motion suggests that there is causality between 

aid and the continuation of poverty in Africa, sort of like saying 

there is a mortgage crisis in the United States, and therefore we 

should get rid of banks.  And my question is, are you suggesting 

that aid is the tool that is ultimately responsible for the 

eradication of poverty in Africa?  George, when you say that 

Africans want reform, reform, reform, and you support a motion 

that says aid is doing more harm than good, are you suggesting 

that aid is the tool that’s going to bring about reform?  My 

question boils down to wanting to understand whether you're 

giving aid far more potency than it actually ever could have, or 

indeed should have.   

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

I can take the first one, and…  So, what I was talking about was 

aid and economic growth.  The expectation— 

BRIAN LEHRER  

Let me just do, sorry, for the sake of the radio taping, um, 

William Easterly?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 43. 

 

 

 

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

Yeah, OK, thank you.   Uh, what I was talking about is aid and 

economic growth.  The expectation of the aid advocates was that 

aid would be invested and would create economic growth, that is 

a steady rise in living standards of the poor population, and 

would gradually lead them to exit from poverty.  And that is what 

has not happened.  Uh, there has been aid but zero growth.  Now, 

John called this a spurious correlation.  Now, if any of you really 

do want to get tortured by economists I can try to give you some 

explanations of how economists deal with spurious correlations, 

but we have— 

JOHN MCARTHUR 

I was actually referring more to the Ethiopian shootings and aid.   

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

We have methods for, for dealing with, uh, correlations.  We 

control for lots of other factors.  We deal with causality, which is 

causing which.  And at the end of the day the answer is pretty 

much the same, that aid does not generate economic growth.  

That was its promise, that, that promise it has failed to keep.  

GAYLE SMITH 

But, but, if I may just very quickly, um, I consider myself one of 

those advocates, I have never ever presumed that economic 

growth was going to come, come about in Africa because of aid 

alone, and I, and I think the fault underlying your motion is that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 44. 

 

 

 

presumption.  And I think what this side of the, the table would 

argue is that aid is one of those tools, and that it is having an 

increasingly positive impact, but that there are multiple other 

tools that must be brought to the table.  There are the terms of 

trade.  There are world market prices.  There is governance.  

There is ending conflict.  There is the arms trade. There is climate 

change.  There are any host of other factors that must be brought 

to bear if you want to reduce poverty in Africa.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

George Ayittey, her initial question was to you, did you want to 

respond briefly?  

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Yeah, um, I um.  I think, in the beginning paragraph, statement, 

she made a very interesting, uh, observation, and that is the 

complexity of this issue.  You know, the way the question itself is 

framed doesn’t really allow us to address that.  And the fact of 

the matter is, look, I personally believe that Africa doesn’t need 

aid, and I have stated this.  That Africa’s begging bowl leaks 

horribly.  I mean, you pour in aid, it just leaks out.  Number one, 

corruption.  Take the amount of aid which goes into Africa every 

year.  The total, from all sources, twenty-five billion dollars.  

Compare that to the leakages.  One hundred and forty-eight 

billion in corruption lost.  Eighty billion in capital flight out of 

Africa every year.  OK?  How much money does that, do African 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 45. 

 

 

 

governments spend on the military and to purchase weapons?  

OK?  Fifteen billion.  How much does Africa spend a year to 

import food?  Twenty billion.  Back in the 1960’s, Africa not only 

fed itself, it exported food.  OK?  If we are able to plug all these 

leakages, we’ll find more than enough money than, than double 

the aid that Tony Blair, Tony Blair and Bono are going to give to 

Africa.  OK?  That’s my position.  But aid has become an industry 

replete with its own lobbies.  OK?  They want that to continue 

because aid, if you, if you ask George Soros he will tell you that 

aid benefits the donors more than the recipients.  They, they 

would like to have this thing continue.  OK?  What to do?  All 

right, this is where I say that if you want to ask the Africans, ask 

them what type of help they need.  And this is where I believe 

that the mechanism that we have today, it’s not working.  It has 

to be reformed so it benefits those that it is intended to do.  

BRIAN LEHRER  

David Rieff, you’ve got the next question.   

DAVID RIEFF 

Yeah, I’d like, I think, I hope I'm right that it was John, that you 

said this, that, that you’re here to debate the present, not the 

past of aid.  And I worry, just as a historical reading, and would 

ask you at least to consider the possibility that the argument 

you're making is the argument that the justifiers of aid have 

made pretty much every ten years since basically the fifties, since 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 46. 

 

 

 

the, the era of de-colonization.  And I, I mean, this is actually not 

a polemical question, I’d like to know why you think this time it’s 

not simply a, as George says, a question of interest, but that one 

can actually legitimately say that the present of aid is, is different 

from all experience past?   

JOHN MCARTHUR 

It’s a great question, I'm glad you raised it, David.  I think, uh, 

the point I was trying to make is that it’s probably not a good use 

of our time to talk about something that happened in 1975, when 

our premise, our question is, is aid doing more harm than good.  

So that’s my basic point.  We can sit here and play armchair 

quarterback over 1980, 1984, any year, 1962, there’s all sorts of 

stories, and when we turn on the news every night we’ll hear 

about the latest car crash.  I mean, that’s the way these story 

tellings work.   The reason I wanted to focus on the numbers is 

because I think the numbers tell a very different story.  Professor 

Ayittey asked the question, well, what do Africans want?  Well, in 

my conversations, quite sincerely, with Africans in rural areas 

where, of course, you have to keep in mind just how poor rural 

Africa is, these are places where they're lucky to see fifty dollars 

of cash in a year in a family, they're living, you know, the 

imputed value of the economy is, uh, estimated as many two 

hundred dollars per capita, in the poorest countries, they want, 

when I talk to them, fertilizer, bed nets, clean water, functioning 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 47. 

 

 

 

clinics.  They want very practical things.  And actually, George 

Soros is supporting work to provide that, quite specifically.  So, I 

think it’s important that we keep in mind what the amount of 

resources is that’s put into this.  The US, or all time US foreign 

aid, because we’ve talked a little bit about the US, is about forty-

eight billion dollars to Africa all time since 1961.  If you take out 

the food aid, of course, which is paying American farmers and 

shipping companies.  You know, that’s about two dollars and fifty 

cents per African per year, it’s a very small amount of money, and 

I don’t know what you expect to buy from that.  And just for, for 

context, forty-eight billion is, of course, about half of what is 

spend in one year in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Politics aside, to me 

that’s the comparison of a priority and not a priority in broad 

political terms.  So, I’d be all too elated if we were sitting here 

talking about fertilizer, bed nets, anti-retrovirals, which programs 

worked, which ones didn't.  I think we’re seeing that for thirty 

bucks per person, from all the rich countries all around the 

world, to Africa, we’re getting about what we pay for.  

BRIAN LEHRER  

And John McArthur, you get the next question.   

JOHN MCARTHUR 

My question is actually, to the other side, is saying, for thirty 

dollars per capita per year, compared to, and I just use the past 

few years as a reference point, one point three million people on 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 48. 

 

 

 

anti-retrovirals, twenty percentage point increase in primary 

enrollment, three hundred and sixty thousand children a year’s 

lives saved from measles, and all the other practical programs 

we’ve heard of, what would be success, what would be, we’ve 

already heard that’s good, not harm, what would be satisfactory 

for thirty bucks per capita, because I don’t know how much you 

can buy with that money.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Professor Ayittey.  

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Let me speak briefly to John, and that is, it’s true, you pointed 

out these success stories, but to me these success stories are 

really cleaning up the mess that past aid programs created.   

JOHN MCARTHUR 

So they're doing good where there was harm.  

GEORGE AYITTEY 

I have been to the villages myself, we are setting up malaria-free 

zones in villages.  I have visited villages in Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, 

Kenya, we will establish, uh, we give, uh, villages malaria, I'm 

sorry, anti-malaria drugs, bed nets and so forth.  Everywhere 

that I got the villages tell me one thing, one thing that they tell 

me is this, look, governments have failed them.  The government 

says, come around, around election time, to campaign, canvas for 

their votes.  As soon as the vote, elections are over, they don’t see 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 49. 

 

 

 

them again.  So they're asking you for bed nets, they're asking 

you for anti-malarial drugs because their governments have 

failed them.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

The next question goes to William Easterly.   

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

OK, well, um, this question is partly based on my experience at 

the World Bank where I spent part of my career, and uh, founded 

a not very effective bureaucracy to, uh, resolve the world’s 

problems.  Uh, I want to read a couple of quotes.  Uh, the first 

goes, "the international system is ill equipped to provide aid 

because of a shortage of effective institutional arrangements, and 

above all resolve to translate commitments into action."  And the 

second quote is, "our foreign aid system is broken."  So, it sounds 

like these quotes, uh, would, would be from this side of the table, 

but actually the first quote is from you, John, from the report 

“Investing in Development,” and the second quote is from you, 

Gayle, from your testimony to Congress.  So it seems like you 

kind of agree that our foreign aid system is broken and it’s not 

working.   

JOHN MCARTHUR 

So, I’d like to actually just read a quote, um… [LAUGHTER]   

Says, "foreign aid likely contributed to some notable successes on 

a global scale, such as dramatic improvements in health and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 50. 

 

 

 

education indicators in poor countries, life expectancy has risen 

from forty-eight years to sixty-eight years.  Forty years ago a 

hundred and forty-one out of every thousand babies born in poor 

countries died before reaching their first birthday.  Today thirty-

six out of every thousand babies die. Routine children 

immunization combined with measles vaccinations in seven 

southern African nations starting in 1996 virtually eliminated 

measles in those countries by 2000.  Donors collaborated on a 

program to wipe out river blindness in West Africa starting in 

1974, virtually halting the transmission of the disease.  Eighteen 

million children in twenty country area of the program were kept 

safe from river blindness since the program began."  Pause.  

"Let’s put the focus back where it belongs.  Get the poorest 

people in the world such obvious goods as the vaccines, the 

antibiotics, the food supplements, the improved seeds, the 

fertilizer, the roads, the bore holes, the water pipes, the text 

books, and the nurses.  This is not making the poor dependent 

on hand-outs, it is giving the poorest people the health, nutrition, 

education and other inputs that raise the payoff to their own 

effort to better their own lives."  That’s exactly what I'm saying, 

that’s exactly what these success stories are doing, and I 

congratulate Professor Easterly for writing that in his recent 

book, White Man’s Burden.

GAYLE SMITH 

Uh, and I did write the line and testified before the Senate 

Formulations Committee that our foreign aid system is broken.  

And it is absolutely broken.  But that’s not what we’re here to 

debate.  If we were, if the question before us is, is the US 

government foreign aid system broken, you would have 

unanimous agreement, this would be a very short debate, and we 

would be now drinking. [LAUGHTER]  What we’re debating is 

whether the aid that comes out of that system is doing more 

harm than good to Africa.  I don’t believe that it is.  I think it 

could do a lot more good.  I think it could do better, I think it 

could be more efficient, both in the eyes of American taxpayers, 

and importantly, as I think all of us agree, the Africans whose 

lives it is intended to change.  But on the question of the aid 

system, absolutely it’s broken— 

BRIAN LEHRER 

But are— 

GAYLE SMITH 

As the aid itself— 

BRIAN LEHRER 

You are arguing that a broken system still does more good than 

harm?   

GAYLE SMITH 

Yes.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 52. 

 

 

 

BRIAN LEHRER  

Correct?  

GAYLE SMITH 

Yes, because if you look at what has been achieved, and I refer 

not only to the kinds of things that John talked about, but if you 

look at things like micro-finance, like a commodity exchange, like 

the provision of wireless services, those things matter in people’s 

lives, and I believe that that is doing good.  Could it do better?  

Absolutely.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

C. Payne Lucas, you get the next question.  

PAYNE LUCAS 

Well, I’d like to ask my friend George, all these corrupt 

governments in Africa, first I’d like to know, is there any 

government in Africa that’s not corrupt?  Second I would like to 

ask, if we end the aid, what should we, the US should do?  

Should we not just give them anything, just let them fend for 

themselves, and just restrict our, our whole effort to trade?  So 

what is your answer to the problem?  By the way, I am surprised 

that the number of villages that you, when do you work, you 

travel to these villages all the time on a continent that got eight 

hundred billion people in it, and you tell stories that after eight 

years of working in the peace corps and seeing peace corps 

volunteers in the bush talk about what they’ve been able to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 53. 

 

 

 

accomplish in working with Africa is phenomenal.  So my 

question is, what would you do if we end all this aid, so that 

corrupt politicians can't steal our money anymore?  What would 

you put in its place?  And especially in those countries that don’t 

have any natural resources, don’t have any infrastructure, and 

who are barely living on a hundred dollars a year.   

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Well um, first of all, corruption is not an issue that the US should 

fight, it’s Africans who have to fight that battle themselves.  OK?  

And uh, number one… If you want to fight corruption, [CLEARS 

THROAT], there are three basic institutions that you need.  The 

first one, you need to have a free and independent media to 

expose it.  That’s how you solve the problem.  That’s the first 

thing that you do, expose the problem.  The second is to have an 

aggressive Attorney General to prosecute the corrupt.  The third 

institution that you need is an independent judiciary to enforce 

the rule of law.  We don’t have many of these institutions in 

Africa, and that’s why I told you, I said that there’s six basic 

institutions that you need, an independent judiciary, and an 

independent media, free, free, an independent free media.  Uh, 

some of the institutions that we need to fight these battles 

ourselves.  Now, I'm not saying that, you know, corruption, that 

all African governments are corrupt, there are some which are 

honest, OK, the government of Botswana, for example, uh, it’s a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 54. 

 

 

 

very transparent government which is doing very well, there are 

also some African countries which have made progress, uh, in 

stemming the tide of corruption.   But that’s not the issue, look, 

sometimes, American experts focus on the small success stories 

and ignore the larger picture.  Okay, the World Bank was, you 

know, sort of, uh, been, uh, adept at this, you know, pointing out 

to economic success stories in Africa, ignoring the larger pictures 

like, you know, the Congo, Somalia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and 

Nigeria, countries which have collapsed.   Now, let me also—  You 

asked me a question what should I—uh, what would I do, instead 

of, uh, foreign aid.  I have indicated that the aid resources Africa 

desperately needs can be found in Africa, I coined the expression, 

“African solutions for African problems.”  We’re not going to go to 

America, we’re not going to go to China, we’re not going to go to 

France, we’re not going to go to Britain and beg and beg, because 

this devalues our pride and dignity.  And this is why I said that 

the solutions to Africa’s problems, lie in Africa itself.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

George Ayittey, you get to ask a question of the other side.   

GEORGE AYITTEY 

All right, um—  The question that I’d like to, um…uh, ask, is this.  

And, and to the other side is this.  We have heard about a lot of, 

um, humanitarian talk, now let me put this directly to you, um, 

and Mr. C. Payne Lucas, since you have been involved in Africa.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 55. 

 

 

 

Whom exactly do you want to help in Africa.  The African 

governments or the African people.  Now there’s a distinction 

between these two.  Most Americans think that, the best way of 

helping the African people is by handing money over to their 

corrupt and incompetent governments, where do you stand on 

this.   

PAYNE LUCAS 

Well I think we—I think we ought to help the African people.  

That’s why we have hundreds and hundreds of NGO’s who are 

doing programs all over Africa which, the government never 

touches one dime of the money.  That’s who we want to help, we 

wanna help the people.   And those governments who want some 

help about how to create, uh, good governance and, and, and a 

free press and the rule of law, we stand ready to help them too.  

But you gotta remember, a lot of aid to Africa never goes near the 

government bureaucracy.  You gotta remember that, that’s an 

important piece of the work.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

All right.  Your turn, folks.  As we now open up to Q-and-A from 

the audience, please stand when you ask your question, and we 

ask that you do not start to ask your question until you have the 

microphone in your hand.  Please make your questions short and 

to the point, and members of the press, please identify 

yourselves, as such.  So, we have a questioner on this side.

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Uh, this question is for Professor Ayittey.  With the figures you 

gave it sounds like the corruption problem is much larger than 

aid.  If aid stops, won’t the people suffering from the corrupt 

governments suffer further from that corruption.   

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Well, I think your question supplies its own answer.  And that 

is…if corrupt governments…are making poverty worse, and I 

think the object of aid is try to remove those corrupt 

governments, and not to hand money over to them and sort of, 

uh, strengthen them.   Because, we know in the past, foreign aid 

simply propped up these bad governments.  

BRIAN LEHRER 

[PAUSE]  A question up on the left.    

EUVIN NAIDOO 

Hello, Euvin Naidoo, President of the South African Chamber of 

Commerce in America.  I have a question for both sides.  I think 

the example that John McArthur picked of Malawi’s success that 

was flagged, uh, over the weekend on the headline news in the 

United States, it’s quite prescient.   Malawi had a choice to make.  

They could have dropped bags…of maize, as well as food from the 

sky…flooded the market with product, and stopped farmers 

from…selling their product profitably and stopping that market, 

instead they decided to empower farmers.   So clearly to George’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 57. 

 

 

 

point smart aid is important.  So the question is, what can be 

done… mechanisms in place, to create or push governments to 

making those type of smart decisions.  That stems to two quick 

questions, number one.   As a fourth-generation South African 

and African people often talk about a Marshall Plan.  Discussing 

this with my African colleagues is often met as a suggestion of 

utter nonsense, or, it’s met as a suggestion that’s needed.  It’s 

also been echoed by many US leaders as something that Africa 

needs.  Is this part of the solution.  The other point is that, in 

many discussions on aid, and particularly with African 

colleagues, many of us feel excluded from the decisions of where 

aid goes.   Is this a perception.  If it is a perception, what can be 

done to alter this perception.  If it is a reality that Africans are not 

involved in these decisions of where these billions of dollars go, 

what can then be done, thank you.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Would somebody on the con side like to answer first?   

GAYLE SMITH 

Um, [UNCLEAR] that—    

JOHN MCARTHUR 

I just would wanna make a couple of quick points, uh, what—  

BRIAN LEHRER 

John McArthur.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 58. 

 

 

 

JOHN MCARTHUR 

Thank you, great question, and the Malawi example is really 

important because it was about providing subsidies for fertilizer 

and seeds again, and it was, uh, donors who provided the aid to 

make that possible.  It was a big fight, and then the government 

said that they wanted to do it, the President took the bold stand, 

his ministers took the stand, and they did it, and it reached a 

million households, again, doubling food production in just two 

years.  The Marshall Plan is actually an interesting example for 

many reasons, because that actually worked out to, just for 

reference, $85 per European per year, in constant dollar terms.   

That was to a rich country doing a bunch of stuff after a war, we 

give, you know, a fraction of that to Africa which has much 

deeper needs, and much deeper poverty today, when we give 

support totally of $30 per capita.   But in terms of your last 

question of the exclusion from where the aid goes, it actually 

answers the Marshall Plan point too.  I think the basic 

proposition has to be that the Africans are empowered, the 

African countries, the societies within those countries, are 

empowered to put forward their own plans.   To put in action 

their own proposals, that’s actually what’ s happened, with the 

Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.  The countries put 

forward their proposals, they submit the proposal to the pool of 

funds, and then, the funding actually is made available to finance

that proposal.   That’s how we’ve got so many people on anti-

retroviral treatment, that’s how we’ve got tens of millions of bed-

nets distributed, so we’ve got millions of people on tuberculosis 

treatment as well.  It’s that notion of supporting the African 

countries just like Malawi, and just like it’s happened all over the 

world, to put in action their own plans.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Someone on the pro side?   

DAVID RIEFF 

Yeah.  Um, let me do it, if I may—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

David—David Rieff.    

DAVID RIEFF 

The, um—I, I, I think the Marshall Plan is precisely interesting 

because it, it…comes back to the point that George Ayittey keeps 

making and, and I think is the essential point which is the point 

of the state.  The problem with the Marshall Plan, John, is not 

that it was $85 to a small number of states rather than $30.  It 

was that there were functioning states there to administer it.   

The Marshall Plan would have had no hope whatsoever, of 

working historically, had the Allied powers in the aftermath of 

World War II not reestablished the German state…for one thing, 

it was the first thing they did when they arrived.   So you cannot 

get around this question, that as I say George Ayittey keeps

raising, which is, your are talking—  And it gets very fluid here, 

the answer was, well, societies, countries—  Well, what do we 

mean.  What’s gonna happen, you’re gonna shoot your way in if 

you don’t like the state?   Uh, I mean societies, countries, we talk 

all this—I mean civil society is a… descriptive term that keeps 

being min— misused in the, in the NGO world as a, as a—sorry, 

descriptive term, misused as a prescriptive term all the time.   It’s 

not as if civil society can stand up to the power of the state like 

that.  So that, you know, these, these models seem to me to 

avoid…the problem, because precisely people don’t wanna talk 

about politics, precisely because I think,  with all due respect, the 

mistake that both particularly US NGO’s and the UN system 

make, over and over again, is the idea that as I believe one, either 

Gayle or John put it, you can ring-fence it from politics.  You 

can’t.    

GAYLE SMITH 

Let me…  May I?  ‘Cause, ‘cause I—I…  I have a trouble—a 

problem with this…motion ‘cause it’s not very scientific, I mean, 

what is aid.  There’s US government aid, there are billions of 

dollars in aid, there’s the Gates Foundation.  The prize that C. 

Payne mentioned that was given to President Chissano of 

Mozambique was given by an African foundation.   That was 

African aid, if you will, or African philanthropy.  But I—I think 

there are, uh…  So, a number of things that are being conflated, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 61. 

 

 

 

and these tools can be used effectively or ineffectively, and they’re 

not all the same, and some have constraints on them and some 

don’t.   I—I think also on, on the Marshall Plan there’s something 

we’re ignoring here, we’re—again, we are suggesting somehow, 

that aid is like the invention of the wheel.  And that aid is going 

to be the thing that transforms Africa and I—and I think if we all 

thought about that we would reject that but the way we’re 

discussing it suggests otherwise.   The Marshall Plan, yes, had to 

do, with reestablishing states.  It also had a lot to do with policy, 

it wasn’t just aid.  There were policies regarding the terms of 

trade and other things that were afforded Europe that have not 

been afforded Africa, so let’s not hold aid accountable, for the fact 

that the terms of trade are skewed against Africa.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Our time is—   

GAYLE SMITH 

The last—the last—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

—our stime [sic] is—time is starting to run very short—   

GAYLE SMITH 

Okay, just very quickly—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

But if you’re gonna—  If you’re gonna make a distinction between 

government aid, and private aid like from the Gates Foundation, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 62. 

 

 

 

what is that distinction, very briefly, and can private aid do 

things that government aid cannot—   

GAYLE SMITH 

Yes, I think private aid is much, much more flexible.  At—at one 

level you’re right, David, I mean government aid is always going 

to have, to some extent politics but also taxpayer accountability, 

oh, but assuming that that’s something we can achieve again in 

the near term.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Is there any kind of—   

GAYLE SMITH 

I—I—  [LAUGHTER]  Uh, but, but…I have to make one point 

here.  I think it is a gross disservice to Africa, to suggest that all 

African governments are corrupt, that every leader is, is evil, that 

there are no African states, Africa’s a very, very diverse place.   

And to that young woman who is 18 or 19 years old in Ghana or 

Zambia or even Zimbabwe, who hopes to go to work in a 

government ministry to serve her people, I think we need to be a 

little bit careful, about suggesting that all governments in Africa 

are bad.  Because God forbid if they don’t have governments, it 

all looks like Somalia—   

DAVID RIEFF

Right—   

DAVID RIEFF 

—who had the same ambition—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

But just thir—David, just—   

DAVID RIEFF 

—I don’t see the point of that really.   

GAYLE SMITH 

But—    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Just 30 seconds on private aid, is there any—   

GAYLE SMITH 

The point of that—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

—com—is there any common ground there?  Is the Gates 

Foundation aid—   

DAVID RIEFF 

I—it used to be said in the '90s when George Soros had more 

money, that he did what the United States didn’t have the money 

to do.  I think this is quite, uh, an interlocking net of institutions.  

Aid is a system, it’s an international system.  The idea that 

somehow you can say, well, governments, that’s not good but 

somehow Gates or Soros—  The truth is, this is one system, and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 64. 

 

 

 

again, it’s a system that doesn’t work.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Okay, one more question, from the floor, who’s got it.  Does 

somebody?  Or no.  All the way in the back.   

BILL HARTUNG 

Yes, Bill Hartung from the New America Foundation.  There was 

a brief mention of things like military aid, arms trade, war, so I 

figured I’d have a nice narrow question for the last one.  Um…  

Do you think that aid, military or economic, can be part of a 

platform, can contribute to an effort to reduce conflict in Africa.    

GEORGE AYITTEY 

No, uh, I will also echo that, uh, I think, uh, generally when, 

when, when you talk about foreign aid, now of course there are 

several types of aid, there is humanitarian aid, uh, assistance, 

relief, like, you know, those that, uh, uh, the rich, uh, countries 

send out to victims of earthquakes and flooding, I mean that’s 

another thing, humanitarian aid.   And then there’s military aid, 

and then there is official development assistance, ODA.  Uh, that 

is what, uh, technically is called development aid and I think this 

question is about that type of, uh, assistance.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

One minute from this side?   

JOHN MCARTHUR 

Yeah, can I just say I think it’s important to keep in mind, uh, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 65. 

 

 

 

how poor much of Africa is.  So, it’s actually not the right 

comparison to compare it to Europe which was, you know, 

poorest country was maybe $5,000 per capita, uh, 50 years ago, 

50 years ago.  We’re talking about countries that, $200 per 

capita.  Where a bed net, or $8 for a school fee makes a big 

difference.   So if you wanna actually, uh, prevent conflict, in 

places where the rains fail and people fight, and conflict is 

exacerbated, when the rains fail ‘cause there’s not enough food, I 

would support fertilizer and seeds to grow more food.   This is a 

really practical point.  I think we need to understand also that 

there are so many countries with great governments, and if there 

are 16 or 18 or 25 or however many where we can all agree the 

governments are fantastic, if it’s just about governance, why 

aren’t those countries just taking off all across Africa, why aren’t 

we seeing 10 percent growth all across Africa.   Because there’s 

more to it, and even the most heroic leaders in Africa, in Mali, 

and Burkina Faso, and Tanzania, and Malawi…they’re all facing 

deep challenges of extreme poverty where people have no money, 

they can’t afford a bed-net, they can’t afford a $25 bag of 

fertilizer, a $10 can of seeds, and they’re too poor to get on that 

first rung of the ladder of economic development.  And aid can 

help do that, it’s not enough to do that, but we have to 

understand what it is trying to achieve, and I think 1.3 million 

people on anti-retrovirals is a pretty good start.  Thank you.

BRIAN LEHRER  

And now the final remarks from the panelists, beginning with the 

side opposing the motion, panelists, please stay in your seats for 

these remarks.  Each debater has two minutes with a one-minute 

warning.  Gayle Smith.    

GAYLE SMITH 

Uh— Thank you.  Excuse me.  I think it’s important to note that 

this debate is in the present tense.  It’s not in the past tense, the 

question is, is aid to Africa…doing more harm than good.  No, I 

don’t think it is, I think it’s more—doing more good than harm.   

Can it do more good?  Absolutely.  But I think if we hold aid 

accountable for all of Africa’s ills we’re going to lose sight of what 

aid can do.  Aid is changing people’s lives, it is investing in 

transformation, it is imperfect but it has improved exponentially.   

And I think if you asked a majority of people, whether they be 

people whose children are alive today because they’ve got ARV’s, 

or whether they be people who now have access to wireless 

Internet and whether that aid came from a private foundation,  

from a government, from an individual through an NGO, I think 

they would say it’s doing a lot of good and I hope you will vote 

accordingly.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

One minute.  You’re done.  Um—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 67. 

 

 

 

GAYLE SMITH 

I’m—I’m done.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

David Rieff.    

DAVID RIEFF 

Well, I—I think the first thing you have to do is distinguish 

between aid and help.  The reason that this side of the…table has 

kept arguing and insisting that aid does more harm than good is 

not because we’re against help, but because aid is a system, and 

that system is corrupt, inefficient, and wrongheaded, in the main.  

That you can have a zillion anecdotes, that anyone would rather 

have, as I put it about humanitarianism, a bed for the night than 

no bed for the night, doesn’t make it a good system.   And the 

thing is, yes.  If a—if the only relief you get is someone bringing 

you a bed net, or some fertilizer, obvious—and the choice is 

formulated as, would you prefer a bed net, or would you prefer 

nothing, well, then sure, then you get a, you get a nice kind of 

Enver Hoxha [PH] style majority for aid.  But those aren’t the 

choices.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

One minute.    

DAVID RIEFF 

The choices are…talking about things that would have—if 

implemented, fair trade being in my view the most important, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 68. 

 

 

 

would have infinitely more positive effects, and that in effect by 

concentrating on aid, we’re ignoring in fact, the things that 

actually would make people’s lives better, that they would say, I’ll 

still take aid if my choices are aid and nothing.  Yeah, but, that’s 

really not the issue here.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

John McArthur.   

JOHN MCARTHUR 

Thank you, and thank you to the panel and I, I just wanna stress 

that I’m of the view that we’re all aiming for the same ambition, 

which is to support people who want to, uh, make their own lives 

better throughout Africa.  And so I wanna also make sure we 

don’t lose track of the key question which is whether aid does 

more harm than good.   David Rieff in his opening comments 

rejected the proposition, ‘cause it’s not a good way to frame the 

question.  We’ve talked about all these elements of the question, 

each of which suggest it’s just not a good way to frame the point.   

The point is, that for $30 per capita, even when I asked the 

question of the other side, they couldn’t answer what they 

expected— or they didn’t answer, what they expected to buy.  

‘Cause $30 per person doesn’t buy you much.  And the fact that 

we have so many successes, shows actually that aid can do 

tremendous good.   Does it solve all the problems in the world?  

No.  Is it enough to provide magic across the continent?  No.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 69. 

 

 

 

BRIAN LEHRER 

One minute—   

JOHN MCARTHUR 

Should we put it into the arms of corrupt leaders?  No.  Do we do 

that on purpose anywhere?  No.  Do we stop doing it across the 

continent when it’s caught?  That’s the point.  We need to focus 

on the things that people are asking for and they want, the bed 

nets, the fertilizer, the medicine, the schools.   We’re seeing tens 

of millions of people benefit from those programs, not just the 

million that are getting then anti-retrovirals.  That was the one 

that was impossible.  And I urge you to reject this motion, ‘cause 

it’s not even the right way to think about supporting those who 

want it.  Thank you.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

William Easterly.   

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

Well, I wasn’t the one who invented the objective of the end of 

poverty being the objective of aid, that’s the title of Jeff Sach’s 

book, uh, the boss of John McArthur.  Uh, that’s the goal of the 

United Nations millennium development goals to end poverty.   

And what I’m arguing, and all of us on this side are arguing is 

that’s an unrealistic and unobtainable goal, that aid cannot 

achieve the end of poverty.  And in fact an aid system that is 

designed as it now to be mainly about ending poverty, cannot 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Page 70. 

 

 

 

even be held accountable for anyone doing even these modest, 

tangible things, that all of us agree are good things to do.   

Because money does not unfortunately automatically translate 

into results.  The fact that you can say, for example, that, uh, a 

10-cent oral rehydration therapy kit will save a baby’s life from 

dying from dehydration due to diarrhea.  That doesn’t mean that 

the 10 cents will—of course there’s enough money there to pay 

for these 10-cent kits.  And yet still, two million babies died last 

year, from dehydration—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

One minute—   

WILLIAM EASTERLY 

—for lack  of these 10-cent kits.  And what I cannot support is an 

aid system that aims at these utopian objec—unobtainable 

objectives, of achieving the end of poverty, which is up to the 

Africans themselves, not to, uh, patronizing Western donors.  

And I would support a system that does focus on modest, 

tangible goals for the—that aid sys—that aid agencies will be held 

accountable for, that they will be blamed, when someone is 

supposed to get oral rehydration kits, and doesn’t get them and a 

baby dies.   That is an aid system that would work but that is not 

the aid system that we have now.  The aid system that we have 

now does more harm than good by propping up the corrupt 

autocrats, under the utopian objective that they are un—the

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

illusion of creating development.  Which aid has failed to make 

any progress on throughout its history.    

BRIAN LEHRER 

C. Payne Lucas.   

PAYNE LUCAS 

Well, you know, this, this motion is, uh… they’re ignoring the, 

uh, motion, it is not about the aid system.  It’s not about ending 

poverty.  It is about whether aid does good or harm.  One of the 

things that we have this evening, we have to remember that aid is 

always changing.  For the last 22 months, we have been meeting 

on the—a Congressional mandate on how to make aid more 

effective.   We created a Millennium Challenge account, which in 

one country like Ghana we made $500 million available to the 

private sector, that the government had nothing to do with.  In 

order to get that money they had to have, uh, rule of law, they 

had to have freedom of speech, they had to be accountable to the 

bookkeeping that we imposed, and it was run entirely by 

Ghanaians.   The question is, the new, the new paradigm for us 

in aid is, it must be locally owned, it’s the ownership has to be 

locally owned, it has to be sustainable, it has to be accountable, 

and it has to be evaluated all along the trail.   So, we are now in a 

partnership with the religious and faith-based organizations, 

we’re in a partnership with our allies, we’re in a partnership with 

NGO’s, we’re in a partnership with Doctors Without Borders,

coming together to find the right solution to make it work.  We do 

know one thing.  It has to be African-led, and African-owned.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

George Ayittey, your closing remarks.   

GEORGE AYITTEY 

Well, thank you very much, I think, you know—I certainly 

understand, um, how—  you know, Americans are very generous 

people, and they certainly would like to help Africa.   But quite 

often, very often, they, they have been sort of encumbered by 

political correctness.  The unwillingness to criticize…uh…bad 

polices in Africa for fear that if you’re a white person and criticize 

a black African leader you’ll be labeled racist.   That has silenced 

a lot of people.  The nonsense in Africa must stop.  Bad 

leadership is one of our many problems in Africa.  And the 

foreign aid donors compound this problem.  Let me give you an 

example, in 1979 a Norwegian agen—aid agency went to Kenya to 

help the Turkana tribespeople.   And the Norwegian agen— 

agency decided, uh, the best way of helping the Takana 

tribespeople is to build them a fish-freezing plant.  After the plant 

was built at the cost of $25 [sic], all the media people were 

invited, even the—

our debaters did their best to sway you, you voted, 41 percent for 

the motion, 51 percent against the motion, 8 percent were
