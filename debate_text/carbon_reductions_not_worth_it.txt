ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Welcome, and thank you all for coming.  About a year ago, we did 

a debate, the resolution was that global warming is not a crisis.  

And the audience in that debate started voting 57 percent against 

the resolution, ended up only 42 percent were against the 

resolution.   It was the biggest change in opinion that I think 

we’ve had in any debate that we’ve done, and it was perhaps the 

most newsworthy debate that we’ve ever presented.  Well this 

debate takes off from where that one left off.  It assumes that 

global warming is real.  It assumes that human activity, 

particularly emissions of carbon, make a major contribution.  The 

resolution today is about major cuts in carbon emissions and I

want to emphasize major.  If firms or universities or 

governmental entities find a cost-effective way of reducing their 

carbon footprint, that’s a cause for applause and not debate.   

But the major issue, is really burning coal to generate electricity.  

In China and in India, there are going be 800 new coal-fired 

plants to generate electricity, in the next five years.  Those plants 

alone will emit five times as much carbon as the entire savings 

from Kyoto I accords.    

 

Well, there’s a Kyoto II framework under discussion, and it is far 

more ambitious.  It proposes to tax the release of greenhouse 

gases, through a cap-and-trade mechanism, by $1.3 trillion 

annually.  This is staggering, 10 percent of the US gross domestic 

product, 2 percent of world GNP.   One can’t contemplate an 

intervention of this magnitude, without asking a couple of 

questions.  First of all, what are the benefits that are associated 

with costs this large.  And secondly, what alternative 

expenditures might enhance human welfare more.  It’s these 

questions that our panelists tonight are going to address.  And 

now it’s my pleasure to hand the evening back to John Donvan 

and the outstanding group of panelists that we’ve assembled this 

evening.

another round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz, for making 

all of these debates possible.  [APPLAUSE]   

  

Welcome to the Symphony Space in New York City, I’m John 

Donvan, your host and moderator for this Intelligence Squared 

US debate, another in a series of, we hope smart and scintillating 

programs, debating topics that matter.  The motion before us, 

this time, “Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth 

the money.”   This is a contest, it’s a contest of logic and wit, and 

mostly persuasion, these panelists are here to change your 

minds, you the audience are the judges.  Now, to introduce our 

panelists.  First, Peter Huber, author of The Bottomless Well, and 

a columnist for Forbes.  [APPLAUSE]  Bjorn Lomborg, founder of 

The Copenhagen Consensus.  [APPLAUSE]  Philip Stott, emeritus 

professor and biogeographer from the University of London.  

[APPLAUSE]  This is the team arguing for the motion.   

 

Arguing against the motion, Hunter Lovins, president of Natural 

Capitalism Solutions…  [APPLAUSE]  Oliver Tickell, a journalist 

and author of the Kyoto II Climate Initiative…  [APPLAUSE]   And 

Adam Werbach, global CEO of Sacchi and Sacchi S.  [APPLAUSE]  

The Intelligence Squared and Intelligence Squared US debate 

series are produced by the Rosenkranz Foundation.   Shortly, you 

will hear from our six panelists, three for the motion and three

against the motion.  The motion is, “Major reductions in carbon 

emissions are not worth the money.”   Now we want to ask you at 

this point to register your views on this motion as you come in off 

the street, before hearing any of the argument, because as I say, 

they are here to persuade you and to change your minds.   

 

You can reach now for those keypads, and I’ll remind you 

particularly if you came in late, the way to vote if you agree with 

the motion, that “Major reductions in carbon emissions are not 

worth the money,” push number 1.  If you disagree push number 

2, if you are undecided push number 3.   If you regret your 

decision, you can correct it by pushing the correct button, and it 

will register the last entry.  Does anybody need more time?  All 

right, so what we’re going to do is tabulate those and a little bit 

later in the evening, I will share the results of that polling.   The 

panelists will each be given seven minutes to speak.  If they 

reach the seven-minute mark and are still going I’ll have to step 

in, after that, we’ll be hearing from you in the audience and 

following that section and that’s normally the longest section, 

each panelist will be given two minutes to summarize their views, 

and then, we will vote again, and find out who the winner is.   

 

And I want to make clear… the way that we determine a winner,  

is to see, who was more persuasive in changing minds, in other

words if somebody starts with a 60 percent margin, and the other 

team obviously has 40 percent, whoever moves their percentage 

higher will actually be declared the, the winner of the evening.  

That’s clear to everybody?  Yeah, okay.  So, let’s let the debate 

begin.   Our motion is, “Major reductions in carbon emissions are 

not worth the money,” and arguing first for the motion, Bjorn 

Lomborg, he is from Denmark, the land that has led the globe in 

the development of wind power, it is an environmentalist’s 

dreamland.  But he is an environmentalist skeptic in many ways, 

and is first to argue for the motion.  Bjorn Lomborg.   

[APPLAUSE]   

BJORN LOMBORG 

I’ll speak for the motion that “Major reductions in carbon 

emissions are not worth the money.”  Perhaps a natural reaction 

to that would be, what, are there still people who think it’s more 

important to save money, than to save the world?   That’s not our 

point.  Our point is, that we should really save the world, not just 

feel like we’re saving it.  Let’s be clear—global warming is real.  

Man-made, and increases by carbon emissions.  And global 

warming will harm future generations, especially the world’s 

poor.  But the brutal fact is, that even major carbon cuts at 

dramatic cost will make little impact on temperature, and do 

virtually nothing to help the world.  Still, my honored opponents 

will spend hundreds or even thousands of billions of dollars, to

slightly reduce the impact of climate change 100 years from now, 

yet more than half the world’s population suffers from Medieval 

problems that we could fix right now, at much lower cost.   

 

This is nothing less than a moral tragedy for the developed world.  

Knowingly squandering colossal sums of money, achieving almost 

nothing, while fractional sums could save millions of lives right 

now.  Obvious as it may sound, our goal isn’t for those of us in 

wealthy western world to feel good about ourselves, presumably, 

it’s about making sure we do the most good.   Today, 1 billion 

lack clean drinking water, 2 billion people lack sanitation, 3 

billion people lack simple micronutrients, preventing physical 

and mental development.   One quarter of all the world’s deaths, 

are due to easily curable infectious diseases.  The equivalent of 

the population of Florida, wiped off the map, each year.  As an 

example, 1 million people die from malaria each year, and up to 2 

billion people get the debilitating disease.  Yet, my esteemed 

opponents will focus on how global warming will cause a slight 

increase in malaria increase 100 years from now, and suggest 

that we should fix that through inefficient carbon cuts.   

 

But we could eradicate malaria right now, if we wanted, and at a 

lot lower cost.  That is the moral choice.  This pattern of little 

good at high cost, we find repeated in the cases by opponents will

present to you.  And this is why all peer-reviewed economic 

valises show that simply cutting carbon is a poor way to help the 

world.  And that’s exactly the crux of tonight’s debate.  That the 

best available economic evidence tells us that by focusing on 

cutting carbon emissions, we’re committing to an exceptionally 

inefficient way to tackle the symptoms of global warming, let 

alone global warming itself.  And given how much of our 

resources will be squandered in the process, the consequences 

are nothing less than a moral tragedy.   

 

Of course, my esteemed opponents will claim that without major 

carbon cuts, the world will be beyond saving.  Oliver Tickell has 

written that unabated global warming by the end of the century 

will be a catastrophe, and the beginning of the extinction of the 

human race because all the ice will melt and we’ll see 200 feet of 

sea-level rise in the long term, wiping out pretty much everyone 

we hold dear, killing billions of people.  This doom-mongering is 

simply wrong.  It’s inconsistent with everything we know.  And 

it’s important that people everywhere start to realize this.  We’ve 

entrusted the UN Climate Panel, the so-called IPCC, with its 

thousands of scientists, to outline the most likely climate 

consequences.   They do not support Tickell, or any of the other, 

more alarmist writings of recent times.  What the IPCC does tell 

us is, yes, sea levels will rise, somewhere between six and 24

inches over the coming century.   

 

Such a rise is entirely manageable, and not dissimilar to the 

about 12 inches we barely noticed, have risen over the last 150 

years.  Dramatic, expensive carbon cuts would make sea-level 

rise just a few inches less in 100 years.  Is this really the best we 

can do to help the world?   Of course, the obvious and easy thing 

to say is, well, we should do all good things, we should both make 

major carbon reductions, and combat malaria.  But this simply 

ignores the fact that we aren’t doing either very well.  We avoid 

the hard truth that the rich world’s focus is shifting daily towards 

global warming, with proportional less support seen for the real, 

and more tractable problems.   It’s simply untruthful to claim 

that the focus on climate change doesn’t mean there’s less money 

going elsewhere.  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 

and Malaria, is telling us that billions of dollars are being 

redirected to the fight, global warming, at the expense of the 

biggest killers of the poor countries.   

 

Any company or organization today that wants to be responsible, 

even just cool, will not be spending their cash on fighting 

tuberculosis, but wants to go carbon-neutral.  We must save the 

world, yes.  And here’s how.   At The Copenhagen Consensus 

Project last year, a panel of the world’s most distinguished

economists looked at a wealth of research of all the major 

problems in the world, and the possible solutions to them.  And 

they showed us where we can do the most good.   They agreed 

that global warming’s real, and they were unanimous that the 

best way to tackle it is by investing much more in research and 

development in low carbon energy technologies.  The economists 

also found that carbon emission cuts, tonight’s motion, would be 

the poorest use of our money.   

 

They confirmed that we can do so much more good elsewhere, 

that we need to ease our preoccupation with cutting carbon, and 

focusing much more on fixing the real problems of the here and 

now.  This is about saving everyone’s world.   Not through 

ineffective and hugely costly carbon cuts, but through effective 

research and development, and low carbon energy sources, that 

anyway, will be the only long-term solution to the CO2 problem.  

And then remembering the major problems and challenges of this 

world.  Every single year and right now, a devastation is taking 

place in our world.  A dumb, readily avoidable devastation.   

Continuing mindlessly, and spending hundreds of billions of 

dollars in carbon cuts, is simply disgraceful, when it takes so 

little to do something about this devastation.  So, this is our 

chance.  Our chance not just to feel good about helping the 

planet, but actually to do the right thing, the rational thing, and

the morally correct thing.  I commend this motion to you, do 

what’s rational, not just what’s fashionable.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Bjorn Lomborg.  And worth waiting for.  Our next 

speaker, Oliver Tickell, has had actually something of an 

intellectual feud with Bjorn in the pages of The Guardian, in 

London, back and forth, but Oliver himself is from Britain…has 

come up with— if Kyoto was the treaty that was supposed to slow 

the growth of greenhouse gases, it has failed and Oliver Tickell 

has come up with Kyoto II, an environmental blueprint.  

Environment is his passion and he is next arguing against the 

motion, ladies and gentlemen, Oliver Tickell.   

[APPLAUSE]   

OLIVER TICKELL 

I would prefer not to see this as any kind of feud, I think it’s a 

debate and it’s a debate which I’m very pleased to be able to 

pursue here, with all of you.  Bjorn did an excellent presentation,  

and he made very effective use of the particular rhetorical 

flourish which I would call the false choice, or the false 

dichotomy.   Either we address the problem of global warming,  

or we address the problems of malaria, water provision, and 

malnutrition.  But this is a false choice, no one’s saying that 

we’ve got to do one or other, we can do both.  It is no more real a

choice than that between tackling global warming and eating 

pizza.  You know, we can do both.  In fact, if we tackle the 

problems of global warming in an effective way, it will directly 

help with the provision of water.   One of the major problems of 

global warming is the loss of rainfall, shifting patterns of rainfall, 

melting of glaciers that feed hundreds of millions of people 

worldwide.  So, failing to deal with global warming is a huge step 

back on that fight, likewise with malaria, and other insect-borne 

disease, as temperatures rise, so these diseases will spread and 

become more prevalent, and hold back development further.   

 

Now.  The core point though, Bjorn very kindly began to make it 

for me.  It is that the consequences of not dealing with global 

warming are potentially catastrophic.  And, he said this is 

inconsistent with everything we know.  Well, that’s wrong.  What 

we do know, is that 55 million years ago, at a time called the 

Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, temperatures were ten 

degrees warmer than they are now.  Carbon dioxide levels were 

approximately one thousand parts a million --  very high levels.  

And sea levels were approximately two hundred and fifty feet 

higher.  Now, we have been there before.  We can go there again.  

There is no law that says that we cannot revert to that state of 

fifty-five million years ago.  There is no certainty that that will 

happen.  It might happen or it might not.  Climate is extremely

complex.  There are many, many feedbacks of frankly, 

breathtaking intricacy and complexity, which we haven’t even 

begun to fathom.  And for that reason, I find Bjorn’s certainty 

that this will not take place completely incomprehensible.  There 

is no certainty in this.  The only certainty is once it’s already 

happened.  And given those uncertainties, our overwhelming 

priority must be to make sure that it does not happen.   

 

It is hard even to put a probability on it, but the facts are that 

climate, the climate system is characterized by feedbacks, 

including some very powerful positive feedbacks, even with the 

one degree.  In fact, under one degree of temperature rise that 

we’ve had so far, these feedbacks are kicking into effect.  These 

include the melting of arctic sea ice which causes the sun’s rays 

to be absorbed, raising temperatures at the poles.  It includes the 

reduced absorption of carbon dioxide into oceans.  There were 

results in the newspaper yesterday from the Sea of Japan where 

the absorption of carbon dioxide is halved.  We see that the 

forests of Canada, which had been considered a major net carbon 

sink, are now becoming a net source of carbon as a result of 

insect depredations caused by higher temperatures.  

 

So, positive feedback process are already taking place as 

temperatures continue to rise further.  Further positive feedbacks

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions 

                                            in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) Page 13. 

 

 

 

can swing into effect and we could indeed find ourselves 

propelled through the uncontrolled emissions of methane, from 

example, from peat bogs and swamps.  We could find that we well 

and truly lose control of climate, that positive feedbacks take over 

from everything that we are doing ourselves.  And that is where 

we must not go.  And yes, there are costs.  To avoid this you have 

to spend money.  But there are many other cases in which we 

spend money to avoid potentially catastrophic risks, even if we 

perceive those risks as being improbable – such as insurance 

against a car crash or a house fire, where the costs are 

potentially huge, even if the probability is low.  

 

In this particular case, of course, we have to be mindful of the 

cost.  We don’t just want to throw unlimited amounts of money at 

this problem.  But if we look at the amounts of money, I mean, 

my cost – and which includes not only mitigation but also 

substantial funding for adaptation, which is already taking place 

– is about one trillion dollars per year.  And that is, roughly the 

same as what the world spends on weaponry and the military 

sector.  So if we can afford to spend that on weapons, why can’t 

we afford to spend it to prevent this potentially ruinous 

catastrophe that could come upon us.  [SCATTERED  APPLAUSE]  

But I will go a stage further.  I will say that much of this isn’t 

really cost at all.  It is investment.  Because we need ultimately to

move away from fossil fuels anyway.  If we move away from fossil 

fuels sooner, before we have to – because they run out – that 

actually saves enormous economic cost.   

 

It saves the economic cost of a hundred and fifty dollar a barrel 

petrol, oil.  And that is something that has caused America and 

other countries huge hardships.  We can create new industries.  

We have huge idle work forces.  We have huge idle productive 

capacity in industries that can be put back to work building us a 

future free of fossil fuels.  The world at the moment is ravaged by 

conflict, much of that conflict over access to fossil fuels.  If we 

move to a fossil fuel-free future, then much of that expenditure 

will vanish.  But not only that expenditure, but all of the 

suffering, all of the tragedy that is associated with it.  So in 

answer to the question, the motion, Is it worth the money to 

make these major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions?, the 

only possible answer is, Yes, and do it now.  [APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Oliver Tickell.  Our motion is:  Major reductions in 

carbon emissions are not worth the money.  And now arguing for 

the motion, Peter Huber, an author who publishes here in the 

United States, books with titles like The Bottomless Well.  But I 

like to look at the subtitles that tell us really what he thinks.  

One of his books was subtitled:  Saving the Environment From the

Environmentalists;  another, Why We Will Never Run Out of 

Energy.  Ladies and gentlemen, Peter Huber.  [APPLAUSE]   

PETER HUBER 

Well, while he was running, Barack Obama was heard to say that 

he would bankrupt our coal industry.  Now, I don’t doubt 

Washington’s ability to bankrupt almost anything in the United 

States.  But, [APPLAUSE] but China is currently adding a 

hundred gigs of coal electricity a year.   That’s one entire United 

States worth of coal consumption every three years.  There is no 

end in sight and there are other countries, all across the globe, 

following exactly in its footsteps.  So let me say here quickly, 

where I end up and then try and tell you how I get there.   

 

We rich people of the planet can’t stop the other five billion poor 

people from burning a couple of trillion tons of carbon that they 

have within easy reach.  We can’t even make any real dent in 

global emissions because the emissions are growing too fast, they 

involve too much involvement by very poor people who can’t 

easily change their ways and because those poor people are part 

of the same global economy as us.And if we are foolish enough, 

which we could well be, we will let carbon worries send our jobs 

to their shores and they will grow even faster and carbon 

emissions will grow faster still.  It should go without saying, we 

don’t control global supply of carbon.  Ten countries ruled by

thoroughly nasty people control eighty per cent of the world’s oil, 

a trillion barrels currently worth fifty trillion dollars at current 

market prices.   

 

Now, if I told you that there was that value in gold where it 

actually is, where the oil actually is, you would scoff at any 

suggestion that anything we could do, no matter what we spent, 

could force those people to keep that oil in the ground.  It’s all 

they’ve got.  They will drill it.  They will pump it.  They will find a 

market and somebody will burn it.  Poor countries all around this 

planet are sitting on a trillion tons of readily accessible coal.   It’s 

all they’ve got for energy beyond the other great carbon reservoir 

of the planet, which is the rain forests and the soils, which they 

also, by and large, control.  They will squeeze the carbon they can 

out of cheap coal, cheap forests and cheap soil, because that’s 

what’s there, unless they can get something even cheaper than 

that.   

 

And that, as I shall discuss shortly, is going to take some doing.  

We no longer control demand for carbon, either.  The five billion 

poor people are already the main problem – not us.  If you have 

heard otherwise, you have heard wrong.  Collectively, the poor 

already emit twenty per cent more greenhouse gas than we do.  

We burn a lot more carbon individually, of course, but they have

a lot more children.  Their fecundity has beaten out our gluttony 

and the gap is now widening very fast.  [APPLAUSE]  China, not 

the United States, is now the largest emitter of greenhouse gas on 

the planet and it will soon be joined by others.  It’s only a matter 

of time.  And finally, the poor countries have made perfectly clear 

that they are not interested at all in spending what a low carb 

diet would cost.  They have more pressing problems.  So it really 

does come down to this.  First, can we give the world something 

cheaper than carbon?    

 

The moon shot law of economics says, Why, yes, we can.  If we 

just really put our minds to it, it will happen -- atom bomb, moon 

landing, energy, you name it.  No, not this time.  Fossil fuels are 

very cheap because they concentrate a lot of energy in a small 

space.  You find a mountain of coal and you can just shovel 

gargantuan amounts of energy into the boxcars.  Renewable fuels 

like sun and wind are much harder.  Windmills are now fifty 

story skyscrapers, yet one windmill generates a piddling two 

megawatts.  A jumbo needs a hundred megawatts to get off the 

ground.  Google is building hundred megawatt servers just to 

move bits around.  Meeting New York City’s total energy demand 

would require something like thirteen thousand windmills 

spinning at full speed or more like fifty thousand windmills 

scattered all over the state because you’ve gotta have enough of

them to be sure enough of them are in the windy spots.   

 

What was your Mayor thinking when he suggested that you might 

just tuck them into Manhattan?  I mean, that kind of thinking 

betrays a very common view that,  [APPLAUSE]   In fact, it 

betrays a profound ignorance about how difficult it is to get huge 

amounts of energy out of these very dilute, thin forms of fuel, like 

sun and wind.  Renewable technologies are not moving down the 

same plummeting cost curves that we’ve seen in our laptops and 

our cell phones.  When you replace conventional with renewable 

everything gets bigger, not smaller – much, much bigger – and 

costs get higher, not lower.  China and India won’t trade three 

cent coal for fifteen cent wind or thirty cent solar.   

 

And if we force those expensive technologies on ourselves, we will 

certainly end up doing more harm than good.  Twenty percent of 

the planet buys much less carbon, the other eighty percent will 

be delighted to buy at a lower price.  The real jobs will go where 

the energy is cheap, just as they go where the labor is cheap 

because manufacturing and heavy industry require so much 

energy.  And in a global economy you can’t possibly compete if 

you’re paying two or three times as much as your competitors for 

an essential input.  Green jobs means Americans paying other 

Americans to chase carbon while the rest of the world builds

power plants and factories.  But the rest of the world is less 

efficient than us and less careful.  A massive transfer of carbon 

and industry and jobs from us to them will raise carbon 

emissions.  It will not lower them.    

 

So, unless we are going to ask the Pentagon to take charge – and 

good luck with that -- we don’t have the power to deliver any 

lasting reduction in global carbon emissions at all.  Whatever we 

might achieve in the very short term at home,  we can’t control 

the global supply of carbon.  We can’t control the five billion poor 

people who desperately want to burn it and who already control 

more of the demand than we do.  And we can’t control the flight 

of jobs and industry to where the industry is cheap.  Frantically 

chasing the impossible and falling flat on your face doesn’t make 

things better.  It often makes things worse and it’s never worth 

the money.  [APPLAUSE]

ADAM WERBACH 

Major carbon reductions are worth the money.  Mr. Huber, I want 

to thank you for your novel argument, summed as, No, we can’t.  

[LAUGHTER & APPLAUSE]  You begin by saying you care about 

the world’s poor and then you start by saying, “The five billion 

poor people are the problem.”   We’re going to send our jobs to 

their shores.  They have too many children.  This type of 

contempt will not lead us towards the world that we want to build 

for our kids, either here or across the world.  [APPLAUSE, 

CHEERS]  The question at hand, and the question we face, is, 

Are major reductions in carbon worth the money?  And I’ll very 

simply give examples at the level of the economy, at the level of a 

corporation and the level of the individual.  Not is it all 

investments, every investment – it’s, Are major reductions worth 

the money?   

 

Mr. Huber, I read that you wrote about enhancing America’s 

electric power grid. That’s a great way of having great reductions 

in carbon in a way that’s very much worth the money.  We waste 

about six to ten percent of all energy through America’s very 

inefficient electricity grid.  If we invested in a smart grid it could 

save up to twenty billion dollars a year that’s lost through line 

loss.  Major carbon reductions can be worth the money.  

Americans spend about a week a year, if they commute a lot, 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

stuck in their cars.  That costs the economy in terms of 

productivity and fuel costs about $78 billion a year.  If we 

invested in new traffic software and signaling, public 

transportation to create those green jobs that you have such 

contempt for, um, we could in fact reduce that, greatly.  Major 

carbon reductions are worth the money.  At the level of a 

corporation, more and more corporations are not just doing it 

because it’s fashionable, they’re doing it because they’re building 

a strategy for sustainability to move them forward.  I’ll give you a 

few examples.   Xerox, that iconic American company, around the 

year 2000 was on the verge of bankruptcy, was, was at its knees, 

and the vultures were circling.  And Ann Mulcahy, the CEO, 

when she took over she committed that by 2012 they would 

reduce their carbon output by 10 percent between 2002 and 

2012,  and they started investing in remanufacturing, and today 

91 percent of all the parts in Xerox machines are remanufactured 

or recycled, which means you don’t need to get new stuff from the 

earth and much better from a carbon emissions standpoint.   

 

Well by the year 2006, they reached that 2012 goal, they reached 

their 10 percent reduction and they actually committed to a 25 

percent reduction, by the year 2012.  Today, in 2009, they’re at 

about 21 percent and they’re well on their way.   There’s a 

company that’s more productive, that’s making more money for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions

its shareholders, because of strict carbon restrictions.  Sun 

Microsystems has about half of its workers telecommuting.  This 

saves the worker a few hundred dollars, up to $1000 because 

they don’t have to commute anymore, and it saves the company 

money.  Last year about $68 million in avoided costs because 

they didn’t have offices for all those people.  People get to be more 

productive, they get to work in their pajamas, it’s a win-win all 

over the place, major reductions in their carbon use, about 

30,000 metric tons saved by that, are good and worth the money.   

 

Finally a company that I do work with, Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart 

made three commitments in its turn-around, one, to be powered 

100 percent by renewable energy which would be a major 

reduction in carbon.  Two, to produce zero waste, which would 

reduce their carbon emissions.   And three, to only sell green 

products in their stores.  Major commitments by a major 

manufacturer.  They’ve pushed this down the supply chain, it 

pulled energy out, lowering the cost of the products, lowering the 

cost to the consumer.  And one of the reasons a company like 

Wal-Mart is doing so well right now is that they’ve become more 

efficient, because of a focus on major reductions in carbon.   And, 

one of the associates I was able to work with at Wal-Mart is 

named Chuck Bonnett, I want to give you as an example—at an 

individual level, how major reductions can actually make sense.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions 

                                            in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) Page 23. 

 

 

 

Chuck works the meat counter at Wal-Mart, and he made a 

personal sustainability practice commitment, to reduce the 

amount of carbon emissions that he had personally.  A major 

reduction in his personal life, in carbon emissions.   

 

And he tried to figure out what to do and he was actually in line 

at a fast food restaurant.  And as he was in this line waiting for 

his burger, he watched all the cars idling and thought, oh, that’s 

carbon.  And he thought about the hamburger which had been, 

been frozen and shipped across, maybe across the country, 

perhaps across the world, and he thought about the carbon that 

came from the cow and the thought about the plastic that was 

wrapping this hamburger.   And he thought you know if I cut that 

out, it’s not gonna only be good for my health, and he had to lose 

about 100 pounds, maybe I can get a discount on my health 

care, and actually, maybe I can save some money ‘cause I’ll cook 

meals at home rather than going out so much which a lot of 

people across the world are doing, who have the opportunity to 

eat out.   

 

In this case, major reductions in his own personal carbon 

emissions, were worth the money.  Now… our opponents tend to 

focus on the fact that we can’t do everything.  And that there are 

other problems and, yes, there are other problems and we need

to work on them.   For example, I could tell you tonight, that 

there are exit signs at the back of the theater and, there’s one at 

the side of theater and that’s probably very important in case 

there were a fire, but, maybe I could instead tell you about 

influenza,  because that’s the eighth-largest killer in America and 

I might tell you worry about the person next to you, ‘cause they 

might be a little sickly.  And you might need to worry about them, 

or maybe I could check your purses, or check your dinner 

reservation for later tonight because maybe, you’ll decide to go 

out and have a dessert or a creamy special appetizer.  Because 

you know that heart disease is the greatest killer in America.   

 

These things are all true, but we can do two things at once, we 

can walk and chew gum at the same time.  And the great thing 

about carbon, is that it’s one single thread, if you pull it, the 

entire sweater begins to unravel.  It’s one single step that can 

help people save money and live better lives at their individual 

level, at a corporate level, and even at an economy-wide level.  

Major reductions in carbon are good for the economy, and are 

absolutely worth the money.  Thank you.

specialty carries the distinct and revealing name of 

biogeographer, he is an expert in many things, from the nature of 

fire to the behavior of soil.  And tonight he is arguing for the 

motion.    

PHILIP STOTT 

Thank you, John.  [APPLAUSE]  Adam and colleagues, I really 

wish I could believe that we can manage the costs that would 

control climate.  Very sadly, I have to quote Samuel Johnson, the 

great British lexicographer.  “An obstinate stubbornness, a 

rationality, stops me believing it.”   And with a twinkle in my eye, 

because we’re in New York and near Wall Street, what I want to 

show, very dangerously, is that, climate science and these costs 

are sub-prime science…sub-prime economics, [APPLAUSE] and 

above all, sub-prime politics.   And they will cost us dear, despite 

what Adam and Oliver and Hunter will be saying.  And we’ve got 

to be very, very careful.  And Bjorn used a very important phrase.  

Let’s not just follow what’s fashionable.  In fact, Johnson again 

had a wonderful phrase for it.  “Let’s not be befuddled, by the 

clamor of the times.”  [APPLAUSE]   

 

Let me therefore start, by science, I’m not going to say much on 

science because, I agree with what Robert said, right at the start 

in this.  It’s actually not very much about the science, it’s always 

been about economic and political choice.  Everything is when it 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions

comes down to it, like it or not.   But I just want you to have one 

image, and it’s a very serious scientific image, I want you to think 

of the world…I want you to think of the world from inner Siberia, 

to Greenland, then to Singapore, and then come to the Arab 

states and to Sahara.   What, ladies and gentlemen, is the 

temperature range I have just covered.  It is from minus 20 

degrees C, to nearly 50 degrees C, a range of 70 degrees C, in 

which humanity has adapted and learnt to live.  [APPLAUSE]  We 

are talking about, ignoring the extremes that Oliver said, a 

prediction of 2 to 3 degrees C, what a funk!  [LAUGHTER, 

[APPLAUSE]   

 

I’m very serious, what a funk!  Humanity lives successfully from 

Greenland to Singapore to Saudi Arabia.  70 degrees C.  And 

what is more, the carbon reductions will not produce an outcome 

that is predictable.  Climate is the most complex, coupled, non-

linear, chaotic system known to man.   Of course there are 

human influences in it, nobody denies that.  But what outcome 

will they get, by fiddling with one variable at the margins.  I’m 

sorry, it’s scientific nonsense.  And a very serious nonsense.  

[APPLAUSE]  But it’s the economics above all, because that’s the 

motion, the costs.   I come from the left wing politically.  I am fed 

up with environmentalists putting regressive costs and taxes on 

the poor.  [APPLAUSE]  It always costs more in the end, whatever 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions

Adam and the other say, and it’s always fundamentally on the 

poor.   

 

They’ve forgotten the famous Jevons Paradox, Professor Jevons 

from my own country, University College, London, that actually 

when you save on energy, you don’t really save, you simply 

transfer it to new energy costs, and actually probably issue more 

CO2.   So when you save energy you take another holiday, you 

take another flight, your CO2 increases.  And he demonstrated 

that in the 19th century.  Have we forgotten this basic economics.  

But above all, it’s this.  I’m going to be honest about this, I don’t 

trust the environmentalist agenda.  For 30 to 40 years, what they 

have fundamentally been wanting to do, is place an infinity in 

cost-benefit.   In other words, so that the rationality of economic 

choices is undermined by effectively a religious choice, not an 

economic choice.  [APPLAUSE]  Under an infinity of course, 

choice is not made under the procedures that were put down by 

Peter, and by Bjorn.  But it won’t work.   

 

And that leads me, it becomes a closed system of thought, and 

that always worries me deeply.  But it’s the politics then, finally, 

sub-prime politics.  We are full of eco-poseurs and in the United 

States you have some gems.  [LAUGHTER]  I don’t think I need to 

mention them.   But what we’ve got to remember is that, this

motion is about the cost of artificially in a sense, forcing down the 

carbon.  Energy security, efficiency, are [UNCLEAR] of course 

they’re absolutely vital.  Energy security will become of the major 

themes…of the Obama administration, and rightly so, but that 

isn’t artificially forcing down carbon.   And exactly as Peter said, 

only this week, China announced a 30 percent increase by 2015, 

in its coal production.  Actually announced that only this week.  

And in a sense, we are not being realistic.  As I said I would love 

to be able to think we can control climate, when of course it is 

indeed going to have to be adaptation, flexibility put to an 

outcome that we don’t know ‘cause I actually don’t know what 

climate, they’re wanting to produce for us.  And actually I don’t 

think they know either.  [APPLAUSE]   

 

But let me come back to Johnson again, ‘cause Johnson said 

everything—Bible, Shakespeare and Johnson, you’ve got it.  

[LAUGHTER]  And Johnson said virtually everything.  In a very, 

very brilliant book that he wrote in the 18th century there called 

Rasselas, he talks of an astronomer who claims that he can 

control climate.   This is what he says.  “The sun has listened to 

my dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction.  

The clouds at my call, have poured their waters.”  And what does 

Johnson say about this astronomer—astronomer?  He was mad!   

And so are we, if we actually believe we can control climate

predictably, the costs in every sense will be enormous.  Oh,

My company walked into a company that has big warehouses, 

about a million square feet of warehouse, and boxes stacked floor 

to ceiling.  Every 10 feet in the ceiling were 500-watt light bulbs 

shining down on the tops of boxes.  The guys who worked down 

below had task-lighting so they could see where they were going.  

We said, y’all have a switch?  $650,000 saved the first year, now 

that is not a cost, to deliver major carbon reductions.   Similarly 

we worked with another company that has left its… 630,000 

computers and monitors on 24-7 because they had an urban 

myth that you, uh, have to leave your computers on.  And we 

pointed out to them that, actually, IT did not need them left on 

24-7.  And a simple company policy that when you turn your 

computer off you turn it all the way off, saved them $700,000 the 

first year.  Again, zero cost, now this is what’s called low-hanging 

fruit, we could half the carbon in the country. [APPLAUSE]   

 

Let’s look at what we’re actually spending on carbon, this country 

borrows somewhere between a billion and $2 billion a day to buy 

oil, we borrow the money from the Chinese, and we send it to the 

Saudis, as Jim Woolsey who used to run the CIA, we’re fighting 

both sides of the war on terror, we pay for our guys and we send 

money to the guys who pay for the other guys, now this is daft.   

We know how to eliminate, at least three quarters of that oil, just

through smarter technology, so now you and I and the rest of 

American taxpayers are gonna bail out Detroit because they 

failed to do this.   How about we attach a little string to that 

money, if we’re gonna own the car companies now, let’s ask them 

to build the state of the art cars.  Any of you ever seen a Tesla?  

You wanna go real fast?  [APPLAUSE]   Yeah.   

 

We can build safer, faster, peppier, sportier, better cars, that use 

no energy, now, electric car, okay, you go to Google.  Google 

recently decided that they could make all of their parking lots 

carports with solar on ‘em…pay back within 10 years, oh, 10 

years is a long time, no it’s not.   A two-year payback which is 

what people say they demand, is a 70 percent return on 

investment.  You guys on Wall Street, you tell me where you can 

get 70 percent return on investment in today’s market.  

[APPLAUSE]   So Google put in these solar--and they have little 

pull-down plugs, you bring your electric car, you plug it in.  My 

next car’s gonna be a plug-in hybrid.  My friend Jim Woolsey, the 

ex-head of the CIA, drives a plug-in hybrid he runs on solar on 

his roof.   Has a little bumper sticker on it, “Osama bin Laden 

hates my car.”  [LAUGHTER]  Major reductions in carbon are

400  businesses, my company is a member…who have pledged to 

cut their carbon.  They have reduced carbon…collectively 8 

percent.  There’s no law that says they have to, you don’t need 

taxes, you don’t need Draconian regulation.   We simply need to 

be smart about how we use energy.  They represent companies, 

20 percent of the Dow Jones industrials, and 17 percent of 

stationery emissions in this country.  California, AB-32, new 

study out from the University of California, fully implementing 

the Republican Governor Schwarzenegger’s cap on carbon.   And 

trading regime…would deliver to California $78 billion, in 

increased state gross product.  $78 billion, and 400,000 new 

jobs.  Florida, another Republican governor, Republican task 

force study, that cutting carbon emissions 51 percent below the

problem, assuming there is one.  But let’s assume the climate

a net exporter to China.   Again, if we want an economy, we can 

unleash the greatest…prosperity humanity has ever known.  And 

Bjorn, I share your, your care for people in developing countries, 

where are we gonna get the money?  We’re gonna get it because 

we’re going to invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and 

those investments are worth the money.  Thank you.

JOHN DONVAN  

Very nice, thank you—thank you, Hunter Lovins.  [APPLAUSE]  

And may we just applaud all of our panelists for the 

presentations that they’ve gone through, thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  

So, where we are in the debate, the time period of uninterrupted 

speaking is over, we’re going to move into the portion of the 

evening now where the debaters debate one another, and we are 

going to call on you the audience shortly to help along that 

process with your questions but first, as you recall, when you 

came in this evening we polled you about your view on the 

motion and we will poll you again after the debate but I have the 

results that have come in now.    

 

Reminding you, our motion is, major carbon emissions—major 

reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.  The 

results are interesting.  In support of this motion, 16 percent.  

Against the motion, 49 percent, and that leaves 35 percent 

undecided.   And reminding you also that as we say this is a 

contest to change your mind so that “undecided” becomes very 

important, if that shrinks, the winner will most likely be 

determined by whom that goes on.  So, I’d like to now come to 

your questions and what I’m going to do in the beginning is 

maybe collect two or three and get a sense of the room that way 

and then begin to put those questions to the panel, so if you

your hand and I’ll find you, and I see down—right down

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

 [PAUSE]  Thank you.  Is the mic on?   

JOHN DONVAN 

Now, I think your mic is now on.   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Okay.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Yes.    

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

My question derives from my confusion about the definition of 

the term, “major.”  Which two of the panelists for the motion— or 

against the motion rather, have defined as being individual cost-

efficiency, it’s what used to be known as being Scottish and 

frugal.   And, but, Mr. Rosenkranz in introducing the debate 

spoke about Kyoto II, and the cap-and-trade of effectively tax 

through auction, that would be imposed constituting he said 2 

percent of the GNP of the global economy.   That’s a huge amount 

of money and I was curious under that scheme, who would 

control those dollars, who would allocate them, and where would 

the accountability be.

JOHN DONVAN  

All right.  I’d like to go to—I’m gonna reserve that, and collect a 

couple more questions, anybody up the aisle here…?  On the far 

side, woman in the green jacket?    

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

[PAUSE]  I notice that the panelists who were in favor of the 

motion spoke a lot about other nations in the world that are not 

subject to our constraints or, simply aren’t interested in them, as 

far as we can tell, and the proponents for, mostly talked about 

what’s going on in the United States, so I’d like to see what the 

“for” proponents think about the global situation, taking into 

account China, et cetera.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, one more?  Uh, front row.  White jacket?   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

 [PAUSE]  Well, many environmental impacts such as carbon 

emissions are merely treated as externalities in terms of 

economic costs.  Al Gore however suggests that these carbon 

emissions are treated as total economic costs.  How greatly would 

American industries be affected if these environmental impacts 

were treated as costs rather than externalities.    

JOHN DONVAN  

And do you direct that question to anyone in particular?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Um…probably the people for the motion.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, let’s start, let’s work in reverse order, and Bjorn, would you 

like to take that last question?    

BJORN LOMBORG 

Yeah, and clearly I think any economist would say that we need 

to actually make sure that the externality, the thing that you 

don’t pay for, that you actually end up paying for it.  But you also 

have to have a realistic sense of it, and that’s of course where we 

need to talk, not just about what works, and in particular, 

companies, but what actually works for the economy.   If you look 

across all the different studies, and Professor Richard Tol has 

done so, and it’s the latest and the only global survey of all the 

costs of what is an extra ton of CO2 causing of damage in the 

world, the answer is that’s about $7 per ton of CO2.  That 

translates pretty much into 6 cents per gallon of gasoline.  So 

yes, we should have a carbon tax, that’s not what actually gonna 

[sic] do anything majorly for or against our emissions.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Oliver Tickell, what did you hear in that answer?   

OLIVER TICKELL 

Well, I think that the—this whole question that, of paying for 

externalities associated with carbon emissions is absolutely 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions 

                                            in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) Page 38. 

 

 

 

crucial.  And then, you get to the point of if people do pay for 

externalities in the form perhaps of a carbon tax or an auction 

price of carbon permits under a cap-and-trade system, what then 

happens to those funds that are raised.   And clearly, there are 

two ways to go, there is adaptation, there is mitigation, but the 

greatest of these is mitigation.  Because the best way that we can 

serve the victims and potential victims of climate change, is by 

making sure that it does not happen.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Philip Stott, what’s this head-shake—   

PHILIP STOTT 

Oh—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—so you’re gonna—   

PHILIP STOTT 

You—you’re never going to stop climate change, can we just kill 

one thing off.  Climate will change without us or with us.  And 

that’s where Bjorn is right.  [APPLAUSE]  Bjorn—Bjorn is right 

because always it’s going to have to aid adaptation.  If in any way 

we impoverish ourselves so we cannot help the developing world, 

that would indeed be a moral mistake of mammoth proportions—   

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

Whoa, nobody’s talking about impoverishing ourselves, we are 

talking about the generation of wealth through smart 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions

investments.  Now your question of, who’s gonna spend the 

money…most of the people that are proposed to spend the 

money, whether it be the UN or the US government or anybody’s 

government, I think they’re gonna spend it badly.  How about we 

set incentives to enable the business community to do what it is 

already doing, which is decarbonizing, because it’s in their 

economic interest—  [APPLAUSE]   

BJORN LOMBORG 

But—but, Hunter,  I love the loucheness of saying, oh, this is 

gonna be free, we are gonna make money off of this.  I love the 

fact that you want to reintroduce into the American public the 

idea of a profit-maximizing CEO.  I think that’s a good idea.   But 

honestly, I think you already have that.  The point is, how are we 

gonna get beyond that, and that is gonna be costly and Europe 

has shown the way.  It’s not costly—   

JOHN DONVAN 

But, Bjorn, costly, I mean the question went to the matter of a 2 

percent of—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

Yeah—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—GNP, that is enormously costly.    

BJORN LOMBORG 

Yeah, and that is what the UN is telling us that the cost is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions 

                                            in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) Page 40. 

 

 

 

probably gonna be.  I mean, you have a discussion about is it 

gonna be 1, is it gonna be 3 percent, but it’s definitely gonna be 

hugely costly, and simply making these stories that some 

companies can make money, hey, great.   And presumably we 

don’t have to do anything to make them make money.    

OLIVER TICKELL 

But—Bjorn—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

But the real question is—   

OLIVER TICKELL 

Please—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

—where are we gonna get the rest of the cuts—   

OLIVER TICKELL 

One of the absolute key things here is actually to address the 

very agenda that you’ve put forward of huge spending into 

research and development—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

Yep—   

OLIVER TICKELL 

—for renewable technology, and the strange things is that you 

put that forward as if it were some kind of an alternative to 

cutting carbon but in fact it’s a very important aspect of how you 

set about cutting carbon emissions.   Where you’re wrong with 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions 

                                            in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) Page 41. 

 

 

 

that, it is a necessary part but not sufficient because there are 

two components, there’s research-and-development, and then 

there is making sure that it happens on a sufficiently large scale 

to get the economies of mass production, which are real,  and we 

know in the case of solar PV, that the cost falls 20 percent, for 

every doubling of production, we see in the New York Times 

today, that the cost to Americans of installing solar PV is half of 

what it used to be, as a result in part of these kind of cost 

savings—   

PHILIP STOTT 

Oliver, we’re not disagreeing with you on that—   

OLIVER TICKELL 

We need—this is the situation that we need to bring about, and 

as the costs come down, through research, through development, 

through mass production, through large-scale deployment, we 

are bringing—   

PHILIP STOTT 

But Oliver—   

OLIVER TICKELL 

—[UNCLEAR, APPLAUSE]—   

PHILIP STOTT 

Nobody on this panel, nobody on this panel is against increasing 

energy efficiency and energy security, it’s the most sensible thing 

of all.  But if you’re making the marker of it, always what is

precisely happening to carbon, A, you’re not gonna do it, and I’m 

sorry to say you’re not actually going to do it for a reason I’ll just 

mention in a second,  but also, you’re—the real issue is how are 

we going to have enough energy of all types, not just to keep the 

US going, but above all from my point of view, for the developing 

world.  That is to me absolutely crucial—   

OLIVER TICKELL 

Absolutely—   

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

But let’s talk about the developing world and how you—   

PETER HUBER 

Yeah, but [UNCLEAR]—   

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

—how you meet their energy needs.  Frankly they—

How they meet energy needs—

We know how they’re meeting their energy needs, they are taking 

down the rainforest, they are soaking carbon out of their land, 

and they are burning coal, I mean we actually know this—you 

know, all this talk about externalities—   If you don’t know this, 

the Kyoto system divides the world.  I didn’t do this, they did it, 

they divide it into 20-80, okay?  Everything on the 20, nothing on 

the 80.  How can we even talk about externalities—if we said to 

you, folks, we’re getting an externality system worked out for this 

group just right here, but it’s only this group here, all the rest of 

you do what you like, what do you think would work with that 

system, nothing would work.  [APPLAUSE]    

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

Interesting and totally off the point of are major cuts in carbon 

worth the money.  Take Afghanistan where I work.  You and I and 

the rest of American taxpayers this winter will spend something 

like $80 million, buying diesel to run the North Kabul power 

planet, that diesel trucked over the Khyber Pass, fat target.   If 

instead, we enabled the Afghans by training, by technology 

transfer, to grow oil crops, like getropha, or sunflowers, or nut 

crops, take the oil and make it into biodeisel, they would have a 

viable industry, they would have jobs, and we would not be 

paying for the diesel—   

PETER HUBER 

Right.

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

—to pollute the air in Kabul.  Now yes, this would be an 

expenditure of money.  It would enhance national security for us, 

and if in fact we don’t deliver genuine development to the 

Afghans, we will get our heads handed to us—   

PHILIP STOTT 

But Hunter, what about the impact [APPLAUSE] of biofuel 

development for this, on the need, even greater need to increase 

world food supply.  You’re taking land now increasingly for 

biofuels to increase world food supply, it is a competitive choice—   

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

Only because you’re doing it stupidly and because—   

PHILIP STOTT 

No—

—we are subsidizing it.   

PHILIP STOTT 

No.  No—    

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

Yeah.  We are—  [APPLAUSE]

You are subsidizing it, but, in fact the seriousness all the way 

through from Malaysia for example to Indonesia et cetera, the 

impact is potential, in fact some people argue, it is now one of the

most serious pressures causing in fact reduction in world food 

supply.   

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

But I’m not trying to defend—   

PHILIP STOTT 

—at a time, when we have to—

Bjorn—Bjorn Lomborg, let’s have—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

Well—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—Bjorn—    

BJORN LOMBORG 

—I just want us to bring us back to having a conversation and 

Hunter was actually very good at that.  We need to get back to 

business, this is not about who can come up with the smartest 

story or the most endearing cute little tale.  This is about how 

can we do this in the world.   And the economists have done 

those studies, and they have shown that this has real and 

significant costs, on the [UNCLEAR] of, you know, 1 to 3 or 4 

percent of GDP.   

ADAM WERBACH 

But I think you miss the difference—

BJORN LOMBORG 

The question is—   

ADAM WERBACH 

—between a cost and an investment—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

—do you want to spend that much money—   Well, but the 

problem is, it’s not an investment if it doesn’t actually pay back 

more and that’s of course the whole question.  [APPLAUSE]  Are 

we doing a lot of good for the world—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Adam Werbach, against the motion—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

I love the fact that we’re being—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—speaking against the motion.   

ADAM WERBACH 

I enjoy the conversation, I mean two, three years ago we were 

arguing about whether climate change was real.  And now we’ve 

moved beyond that, now the question is should there be a carbon 

cap, that seems to be [UNCLEAR], or should it just be 

investments in things that actually bring down the cost of energy 

for everyone.   Okay, well I agree that we should be investing and 

bringing down the cost for everyone.  Now, then the debate is, are 

major reductions in carbon necessary, do we actually need a cap 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

as well.  Well for the companies I work with and for governments, 

they actually want the rules set.   We know what happens when 

the rules aren’t set.  But what’s happening when the rules are 

not set is we see companies…and like, we’ve just seen in Wall 

Street.

—the greenhouse gases.   

OLIVER TICKELL 

This is the old Kyoto system and I don’t think any of us is 

supporting that.    

PHILIP STOTT 

John, could we just answer the word “major,” which seemed to be 

the really—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Yes, I was gonna come right to that—  

PHILIP STOTT 

—serious question that the lady here asked.  If I’m being quite 

honest about major, to influence climate in any way, you 

fundamentally would have to throw 4 billion people out of work.   

You’d have to keep every ounce of coal in the ground, every 

ounce of oil in the ground, and let’s be absolutely frank, it isn’t 

going to happen.  [APPLAUSE]   Because, the impact of anything 

less from changing your light bulbs to biofuels, is absolutely 

nonexistent on climate, and that’s my point.  If it were truly 

worth doing, the costs would be right.  But it won’t work on 

climate.    

OLIVER TICKELL 

Now, Philip, [APPLAUSE]  I would really like to take you up on 

the point here because I think that what we’re seeing here, when

I just wanted to sort of start by saying that we seem to have 

come round,  [UNCLEAR] sort of…intellectual dishonesty and 

it’s all about economics versus science and so I wanna start 

out with just saying, I’m an economist and I have a question.  

Whether this is still about sort of economics or not, and I 

wanna sort of direct this question to Bjorn Lomborg.   

BJORN LOMBORG 

Mm-hmm.

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

You stated that the Copenhagen Consensus favored technology, 

R-and-D investment.  However, isn’t it true that the economists 

that you are so eagerly quoting as the great work that they’ve 

done, have basically publicly distanced themselves from your 

interpretation of their work,  and I’m talking about Richard Tol 

and Gary Yohe.  So basically, they say that they actually never 

looked at that, they looked at a climate-mix policy, which would 

have adaptation, mitigation, and R-and-D technology, which is 

the point that Oliver Tickell made.  Thank you—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Bjorn, I’m not gonna leave that hanging out there, go right to it.   

BJORN LOMBORG 

Sure.  You’ve unfortunately read half of the discussion because 

it’s true, that they first made a comment in, in The Guardian and 

then later on, after we’d had a long discussion on a blog, we 

actually, Yohe and I wrote a joint column, where we pointed out 

what it was we said.  Yes, Yohe, and to a certain extent Tol, 

believe that it’s also a good idea that we invest, and remember, it 

is mainly investing in research and development but also 

investing in carbon reductions right now.  There was another 

party, Professor Green, who made the argument that we should 

be investing much more in research and development and then 

only much later invest in cutting carbon emissions.   What came

out of the Copenhagen Consensus where we had eight of the 

world’s top economists, including five Nobel laureates, looking at 

all that stuff, they said, well, if you look just in carbon reductions 

which is what we talk about here tonight, that probably pays less 

than $1 back on the dollar.  Whereas if we invest in research and 

development, it probably does $11 worth of good for every dollar.  

And that’s the main reason—   

OLIVER TICKELL 

But Bjorn, this is a completely false choice—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

—why we’re making this point—    

OLIVER TICKELL 

—this is another one of your false choices, we—there is no choice 

here, we absolutely need—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

No, no, that’s, and that—   

OLIVER TICKELL 

—to invest in R-and-D in order to achieve these cuts in 

greenhouse emissions—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

And this is the brilliant, and very, very good demonstration, that 

Oliver Tickell can’t see anything that we shouldn’t be spending 

money on and say let’s spend money on it.  I would suggest that 

we should spend money—  [LAUGHTER]

OLIVER TICKELL 

I’m agreeing with you, Bjorn, we need to spend that—

In The New Yorker last week, your own magazine, a very liberal 

magazine and one I love, very interestingly, there was a 

fascinating statement, which that, you can’t effectively do dual or 

multi-instruments politically, to answer say both poverty and 

climate change, and the—I love the analogy that was given by the 

professor quoted, it was a very good one.  I might wish to save 

energy and I’ve invited you all round for dinner, be very nice to 

meet you all [LAUGHS] for dinner, but in fact, I’m going to cook 

my pizzas and all the rest of it, in the shower so I’m going to save 

energy.   Of course you’re going to end up with a very, very rotten 

dinner, and I think this is at the heart of what we’re discussing 

here, how far do—  [LAUGHTER]  How far do dual instruments 

and multi-instruments actually work, and I think, it’s when I do 

passionately disagree with Oliver on this.   Because, let’s be

honest, in our own households and everything, we have a given 

income, we have to make very, very difficult choices.  If I know 

what I would put my choices by the way, very simply, and they 

would tie in, not because I’m supporting Bjorn particularly on 

this because they—I came to this decision a long— I am very 

worried indeed about the whole state of the development of new 

viruses in the world at the moment, they are all very serious 

problems.  And if you look historically, the single biggest effects 

that have created deaths amongst humanity, have been the 

evolution of new viruses, new bacteria, and new forms.  And

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

Let me go to what you invest and what you get.  Little company 

across the river, Ferrara Construction, put solar panels on the 

top of its building.  It now has a net-zero building.  Which means 

that it is sending back to the grid more energy than it is using.   

They are selling the energy for about $1.11 per square foot, as 

opposed to paying two bucks 30 a square foot, which they had 

previously been doing, to buy their electricity from the grid.  Now, 

spread this across the country, Southern California Edison, 

recently built a 250-megawatt power plants on roofs, spread 

around the county, at a price point of $875 million.   A coal plant 

was recently canceled in Montana at a price point of about $800 

million.  Very close—   

BJORN LOMBORG 

But Hunter, Hunter, the—

We are very near what’s called, grid parity, where the solar 

technologies are actually cheaper—

that, and we know, and this is of course also what you accept, we 

know that the emissions scenarios expect dramatic increases in 

CO2, and what you’re saying is, over and above all these great 

inventions that you describe and everybody else has been talking 

on the other side of the panel, over and above that, we have to 

cut dramatically.  That’s what costs money.  That’s the

face of 3 to 4 percent GDP, I’d like to ask the folks who are 

arguing against the motion.  What in a legal context, or an 

enforceability stand—from an enforceability standpoint, would 

you expect that we can actually do about China, India and the

developing world.  

JOHN DONVAN 

Adam Werbach.   

ADAM WERBACH 

Well the first—  [LAUGHS]  The first false choice that is placed 

here, is deciding that China needs to be constrained first, I mean,  

the greatest challenge and I—Mr. Lomborg and I would agree 

here, the greatest challenge that’s facing the people of China is 

that too many of them don’t have enough energy.  They need a lot 

more of it.  And we have a moral, a just cause, to make sure that 

everyone can live on the planet and there’ll be 9 billion of us by 

2040, with enough energy to be able to live.   So, I actually far 

expect our carbon emissions to increase—recession-depression 

notwithstanding, right now, as we try to get those people to 

energy parity, they live in energy deficit.  And our first priority, 

one of the reasons I believe so much in investing right now, is 

because we need to create technologies that can make the case.   

Now, what type of constraints would be put on China, well China 

obviously is interested in that as well.  And China as it begins to 

invest and succeed as Hunter mentioned in one of their 

entrepreneurs, in building these sort of renewable technologies, 

is gonna be very interested in dealing with the air pollution 

because in Chinese cities they’re very concerned about air 

pollution right now and they know that comes from coal plants 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions

and they’re concerned about dealing with that.  So they’re highly 

motivated to, to reach the point of energy parity, a place where 

everyone has enough energy, and then to ratchet down both the 

CO2 emissions, the air particulate matter emissions, and all those 

sorts of negative consequences that come from it.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Peter Huber, do you—   

PETER HUBER 

You know, there is no field of policy you will ever find and I spent 

25 years in Washington watching this, where you will find a 

greater gap between what people actually do, and what they say 

they’re gonna do, wanna do, should do, oughta do.   The EU 

itself, the people who are most frantic about this and who signed 

this stuff, they’re not—none of them or possibly one of them will 

meet their Kyoto commitments.  They issued tradable permits, 

and promptly depressed the value to virtually zero because they 

issued so many, they were all worried about job-export issues.   I 

mean, you know, you just cannot talk about what people are 

gonna do for anything.  China is, in fact, building coal plants like 

crazy.  Okay?  They say they’re gonna build more but I couldn’t 

care less what they say.  They are actually doing it.  They are the 

world’s biggest emitter today.  How can you ignore the world’s 

biggest emitter?

OLIVER TICKELL  

Well, but I mean, there’s a few things [UNCLEAR]   

JOHN DONVAN 

[OVERLAP]  I’ll let you go.    

OLIVER TICKELL  

And surely one key thing is that a very large part of this coal 

that’s being burnt in China is actually producing products for 

export to America and to the European countries.   

PETER HUBER 

[OVERLAP]  And so you’ll tax our plants but not theirs, right?   

OLIVER TICKELL  

[OVERLAP]  And it’s important to recognize that.  [BACKGROUND 

VOICE]  Another thing, let’s look at what China is actually doing.  

China is investing hugely in renewables.  China has already got 

the world’s biggest solar [UNCLEAR]  tank industries.  China is 

investing hugely in wind turbines.  They are building more and 

more of the world’s turbines and bringing the cost of turbines 

down.  And yes, they may indeed be mining more coal but much 

of that is surely displacing imports -- and from Indonesia and 

Australia.

Some of the figures -- from Spain, from Italy, from Ireland -- are 

just mind blowing.  And this is what I just, we’re in a cloud, 

cuckoo land here.  And let me just make a point about this.  

We’re worried about China, yet worry about the E.U. now on this.  

Half the E.U. now is opposing the E.U.’s policy on cutting carbon.  

Listen to the Czech President, for example.  That’s Vaclav Klaus, 

who is the current President of the E.U.  Why do you think the 

recent E.U. policies have collapsed virtually?  Don’t think Europe, 

don’t think it’s just China or India.  Don’t take the, what Europe 

says.  Europe talks but it’s not walking the walk.

It’s not gonna be you and me and it’s not gonna be the

Chinese suppliers, You will report your carbon footprint through 

a little group called The Carbon Disclosure Project.  Who are 

they?  It’s a little group, a little non-profit out of the U.K. that a 

few years back sent out a survey to The Financial Times 500 -- 

the five hundred biggest companies on earth – saying, What’s 

your carbon footprint?  And for a couple of years everybody 

ignored it, until three years ago, when sixty percent of the world’s 

largest companies answered the survey.  Last year it was seventy-

seven percent.  Why?  They represent institutional investors with 

over forty-one trillion dollars in assets.  You’re gonna go to the 

capital marketplace, you better answer their survey.  And under 

Sarbanes-Oxley, the new U.S. corporate ethics law, if as a

materially affect the value of stock, you can be personally

business now.    

BJORN LOMBORG 

[OVERLAP]  Well, I love the way you think that  [SCATTERING OF

produce a lot of carbon.  Let’s call--let’s buy stuff that costs a lot 

more from someone who don’t produce as much carbon.  

Obviously,  [APPLAUSE, OVERLAP]  Wal-Mart can do that but I 

don’t think they’ll stay in business.  Let me also just point out 

two things.  I thought it was very rare to see that Adam was 

actually – I’m not sure to what extent it was conscious, but he 

was actually agreeing with us, which is really nice.  You should 

come over here.  He was basically saying, China is going to go 

and emit much, much more.  Then they’re gonna be careful and 

they care a lot about air pollution.  And that’s absolutely true.   

 

Then he sort of slipped in, and they’re gonna cut carbon 

emissions.  Uh, no, of course not.  They’re gonna put scrubbers 

on their coal plants, which is really smart.  But they’re not gonna 

care about their carbon emissions for a long term.  And I would 

just like, the last point also – do you remember how Hunter told

Question from the rear, please.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

To my ear those against the motion are not being, are not 

confronting the choices that are necessary.  And, uh, and it’s 

been sort of a flagrantly anecdotal presentation.  And I would

suppose that, [APPLAUSE]  first of all, I want to say that, um, 

Hunter, Hunter actually said, whether she realizes it or not, 

during her presentation, the initial presentation, that there were, 

it, that the, what they have in mind would require neither major 

chances in taxation or major changes in regulation.  Now, if, if 

that’s it then why are we having the debate and let’s go on.   

JOHN DONVAN 

[OVERLAP]  Is that your question?   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

[OVERLAP]  I don’t think that’s – My question is, for anyone on 

that side, to honestly address the real tradeoffs that we’re talking 

about, if we’re talking about one or two or three percent of gross, 

gross international product or whatever the other major changes 

are.  If there aren’t major tradeoffs then we shouldn’t be having 

the debate and I think they’ve been denying the tradeoffs all 

throughout the debate.  [APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN 

Oliver Tickell, please.    

OLIVER TICKELL   

[OVERLAP]  All you folks are agreed that there are tradeoffs and 

that there are some aspects of moving to a low carbon economy 

which actually produce a net gain.  Your negative costs are low 

hanging fruit, but there are other areas where there are real costs 

– at least in the short term.  The important thing is that as you 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions 

                                            in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) Page 73. 

 

 

 

progress from the short term through to the medium term you 

find that the investments that you’re making in renewable energy 

technology, for example, and in mass production, developing the 

engineering expertise to bring costs down -- that actually over the 

medium term, these shift from being a cost to being a benefit.  

And the nature of that benefit is a lot more than just the carbon.  

There are many, many benefits, such as air pollution.  What is 

the world’s biggest source of arsenic and mercury in the 

environment?  It is burning coal.   

 

What do you say to all, to the absolutely disgusting images that 

we see of mountaintop removal in Appalachia in order to reach 

coal seams?  What do you think of the wars that are being waged 

in the Middle East where the thirst for fossil fuels and oil 

fundamentally underlies them?  There are many benefits in 

moving away from that kind of world into a world which is 

actually characterized by cooperation on energy because if we 

move large scale to renewable energy it requires cooperation 

among countries with different kinds of intermittent renewables 

balancing out supplies over long distance grids.  And that will 

actually fundamentally change the whole way in which countries 

interact with each other.  It’ll produce not just a greener world, a 

cleaner world, but actually a safer world and a happier world.  

And these are  [APPLAUSE]  values surely worth aspiring to.

that one?   

JOHN DONVAN 

Yes, because –

...you were directly attacked.  And then Bjorn.  And I’d like, in the 

meantime, to move the camera to the side because I’m going to 

take a question from the woman in the blue sweater.  

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

[OVERLAP]  Other tradeoffs – not if we do it intelligently.  Markets 

work.  [AUDIENCE RESPONSE]  Let’s use them.  Study after 

study after study after study has shown that we can meet the 

needs of a world population of nine billion, meet the energy needs 

with efficiency and renewables.  The Paley Commission of the 

U.S. government in the 1950s then urged an immediate

transition to energy efficiency in renewables as a matter of urgent 

national security.  Had we done it then we would not be having 

this debate now because we would not be burning carbon.  Can, 

how do we do it?  Yeah, that definitely takes some exquisite 

economics, planning.  I’m not a big fan of Kyoto and I am on 

record betting the Danish Energy Minister a bottle of whiskey 

that COP 15 will fail, that the effort by the world to come up with 

a Where-do-we-go-from-Kyoto? will fail.   And then I think we’ll 

have the real debate, which is, How do we use the enormous 

power of markets to unleash innovation around the world to 

enable the poor people to meet their own energy needs with their 

own resources, their own intelligence and to enable us to have 

the prosperity that, again, study after study after study has 

shown that we can have, if we invest now in the smartest 

technologies.

Bjorn Lomborg.  [UNCLEAR]   

BJORN LOMBORG 

[OVERLAP] I find it a little bizarre to refer to a study in the 1950s 

that show that we could actually have done this cheaply but we

just failed to do so.  Maybe that’s because it’s very, very hard and 

actually very costly.  And that is, unfortunately -- I’m sorry, 

Hunter – what all the global cost benefit in...analyses show.  But 

let me just point out to Oliver – because he very eloquently put 

how we should invest in all this and this is a great deal.  Notice 

what Germany has done.  It’s spent a hundred and fifty-six 

billion dollars on buying very inefficient solar technology.  The 

thing I don’t understand is why didn’t they just invest one/tenth 

of that in actually making solar panels much better?  That would 

have really made a difference and that would have made it easier 

for the Chinese and everybody else to get solar panels cheaper, 

faster.   

OLIVER TICKELL

simultaneously no one can hear you.   

BJORN LOMBORG 

Yeah.   

JOHN DONVAN  

You had a shot at it.  Let Oliver respond.   

OLIVER TICKELL 

[OVERLAP]  Yeah, Bjorn, you just asked me a question and I 

have an answer, which is that that’s what private investors are 

doing.  This is what the solar power companies are doing because 

they see here is the demand from Germany.  And therefore, they 

are investing.  This is private investment.  This is companies –  

BJORN LOMBORG 

[OVERLAP]  No, the – And –  

OLIVER TICKELL  

--that are investing because they see a market.  And that is why 

The New York Times reported today that the cost of solar panels 

is falling dramatically.   

BJORN LOMBORG 

[OVERLAP]  No, no.  The International Energy Agency has 

actually shown that the investment in renewables have gone

down, not up, globally.  And I’m sorry, that’s because we are so 

focused on cutting carbon emissions that everybody worries 

about how we can get through the next five years, not how we’re 

gonna get through the next fifty [UNCLEAR]    

OLIVER TICKELL   

[OVERLAP]  Investment in everything has collapsed.  It’s called 

the credit crunch, Bjorn.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Oliver, please.  Question from the front left.    

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

Yeah.  [UNCLEAR]  made the point that he’s in favor of research 

and development for low carbon technologies.  And you’ve just 

made a couple of, of comparisons of tradeoffs between what 

might be worth it and what else might not be worth it.   So it 

seems to me that we’re not necessarily debating whether 

reducing carbon is worth is but really how much it’s worth.  So 

my question for the whole, for your panel is, Where do you draw 

the line between major reductions that for you are not worth it 

and what is worth it?   

JOHN DONVAN 

Peter Huber.    

PETER HUBER  

Well, let me start by saying this:  There is a very big difference 

between saying we ought to keep studying something and saying 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions 

                                            in carbon emissions are not worth the money” (1/13/09) Page 79. 

 

 

 

we ought to put in place forcible mechanisms today that will force 

people to adopt technology today.  All right?   Because, you know, 

you can talk all you like about solar.  The price point you’ve gotta 

beat is three cent coal.  If you don’t beat three cent coal you’re 

not there.  It is of no interest that you can beat, [APPLAUSE]  it’s 

of no interest that you can beat fourteen cent gas, okay?, or, it’s –  

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

[OVERLAP]  Excuse me, Peter, the coal industry itself says  

[BACKGROUND VOICE]  that new coal plants will cost thirteen or 

fifteen cents.    

PETER HUBER  

[OVERLAP]  Well, the, the old ones – and not in China they don’t.  

Believe me, okay?  The marginal cost of coal generation is 

miniscule and that’s your price point.  Now, researching to see if 

you can beat it someday – I like that.  I’m a techno utopian.  

Anybody who reads anything I say, I love technology.  I’ve, in my 

book I say, Someday we’ll get there.  But, you know, telling 

people today, You go ram it into twenty percent of the country –  I 

don’t want to repeat myself.  We will move these same industries 

over to China, as in fact it was just being suggested a moment 

ago, and they will make the products instead and make them 

dirtier.  We will increase carbon emissions that way.

If we keep it at home at least [APPLAUSE]  we’ll have the 

scrubbers on the darn coal plants, even if we’re not taking the 

carbon out yet.

young man, yes.  Can you stand so that they know that I’m 

speaking to you?  Thank you.  And a mic will travel to you.  

[PAUSE]    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

Um, hi.  I have one very brief question and then another thing 

that I kinda want to, I’ll see if I can lump them in.  One thing that 

hasn’t been addressed yet at all is peak oil.  And I just want to 

kind of get that out there and see what some general reactions 

are.  I know we’re planning on approaching that, at least within 

the next century – probably more likely within the next forty or 

fifty years.  And that’s going to obviously affect our economy and 

the demand and supply that we have right now.   

JOHN DONVAN 

[OVERLAP]  And for people who don’t know what peak oil refers 

to --   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER   

[OVERLAP]  Peak oil is when we’ve hit,  we’ve used up half of the 

world’s oil supply and beyond that the rate of production slows 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“Major reductions

dramatically.  It kind of falls off on a bell curve.  And then also, I 

wanted to, I, I know this twenty/eighty has been brought up a 

lot, this percentage that, that’s mentioned – the Kyoto Protocol.  

And for me, I just kind of wonder how long are we going to keep 

using, uh, that as an excuse to not lead the way for developing 

countries, once they are developed and they’re looking to us for 

the next step and the only thing that we have to say is, Look back 

at other developing countries and stand still?  [APPLAUSE]    

PETER HUBER 

But, could I take a first, could I take a crack at peak oil?   

JOHN DONVAN 

[OVERLAP, UNCLEAR]  Actually, I would like to go to Philip Stott.  

Sorry.   

PHILIP STOTT 

It’s a very fine question.  Thank you for the peak oil question.  

Because, of course, we’re obsessed with oil, but of course, there's 

gas and above all, as Peter has emphasized, coal.  And it all 

depends on price again.  Just remember how the dreaded state, 

the apartheid state of South Africa, actually survived the 

European, um, uh, embargoes, for example.  It was, of course, by 

turning coal into oil.  And there are vast coal reserves.  When we, 

we’re obsessed with the oil, but in fact, you have to take the 

whole of, of, of the group before you even question that.  So look 

at the whole package, not just oil.

JOHN DONVAN 

Yeah, Hunter.   

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

If China had continued to grow economically at the rate that it 

was – and this recent collapse has affected China as well – by 

2030 it would have wanted more oil than the world now lifts or 

probably can ever lift.  Obviously, at that point the future is not 

possible.  The International Energy Agency says, Expect serious 

constraints on the supply of oil within two years.  The Germans 

think a year.  Matt Simmons, the Houston oil banker, says we’ve 

already hit peak oil.  And what has held it up, what held up the 

run-up in prices is the economic collapse.  It really doesn’t 

matter.  The investments that you would want to make if you 

were scared to death about peak oil are exactly the same 

investments you’d want to make if you simply want to make 

money, i.e., energy efficiency, and then renewable energy.   So I 

think peak oil falls into the same problem as climate change.  

Yeah, it’s worth doing something about it because we can make 

money that way.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Bjorn Lomborg.   

BJORN LOMBORG 

Again, we need to get a sense of proportion.  A lot of people are 

trying to sell you, Oh, we can move to renewables.  We can do a

lot of great things.  Let’s just remember that the International 

Energy Agency, as you just mentioned, estimate that right now 

we use about half of one percent of our energy comes from real 

renewables like wind and solar and geo-thermal.  If we don’t do 

anything by 2030 it’ll be up to one point seven percent.  But if we 

really strive, if we really do everything that all those people, over 

here on this side wants us to do we might be able to – the 

International Energy Agency estimates – to squeeze it up to two 

point eight percent.  I’m sorry, that’s just not gonna make a big 

difference in this world.  And that’s, of course, the real crucial 

point.   

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

[OVERLAP]  Neither are those numbers correct.  Bjorn... 

BJORN LOMBORG 

But the point is... 

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

...we can meet, the U.S. National Energy Lab showed, by 2025 we 

could be meeting at least a quarter of U.S. energy through 

renewables if we simply made the intelligent investments.   

BJORN LOMBORG 

[OVERLAP]  But there was a report in 1950 that said we could do 

it now.  I mean, how can you keep on making these sorts of 

comparisons?  [AUDIENCE REACTION]

summary remarks.  I will tell them if their time is up.  When their 

time is up, if they run over, and right after that we will be polling 

you to determine the winner of this debate.  And I want to remind 

you once again of the results we received when we polled you 

coming in off of the street.  The motion is:  That major reductions 

in carbon omissions are not worth the money.  Coming in off the 

streets, in your response to that, sixteen percent of you were in 

support of that motion, forty-nine percent of you were against the 

motion and thirty-five percent of you were undecided.  We’ll poll 

you again right after the closing remarks, which will be quite 

brief.  And we’ll begin summing up against the motion.  Oliver 

Tickell, journalist and author of the Kyoto2 climate initiative.  

Oliver Tickell.    

OLIVER TICKELL    

Someone asked the question, How far should we go?  And you 

know, at what point have we made sufficient cuts in greenhouse 

gas emissions?  And there is, in fact, quite a clear answer to that.  

What we’ve gotta do, Philip Stott is quite right when he says, We 

can’t stop climate change.  What we’ve gotta do is to stop the 

runaway greenhouse effect in which positive feedback processes 

in the climate system lead to an inexorable extreme warming 

process, turning this planet into a very different place, a 

hothouse earth – one in which the limiting factor on humans isn’t 

so much whether we can survive the temperatures.

It’s whether the climate system can survive these temperatures.  

It’s whether ice caps can survive these temperatures.  And the 

bottom line actually came from Jim Hanson of NASA, of 

Columbia University, just up the road – and that is, three fifty 

parts per million.  If we manage to have long term stabilization at 

three hundred and fifty parts per million of CO2 accompanied by 

major reductions in other greenhouse gases, we actually have a 

chance of preventing that runaway greenhouse effect.  Now, I 

think it’s worth spending almost any amount of money to stop 

that from happening.  The fantastic news is we don’t have to.  

Actually, the costs are really quite modest in the context of the 

global economy and they bring benefits, which are greater, 

considerably greater than what we spend.  And it’s spread over a 

far wider area than simply economic benefits.  They bring quality 

of life benefits, ecological benefits, benefits in food security, 

benefits in bio-diversity.  And so to come back to the point of this 

– is it worth making these investments in order to bring about 

major cuts in carbon dioxide, in the emissions?  The answer is, 

yes, it is.  And I’m very happy to know that this is actually on the 

verge of taking place here in the United States under the new 

President, Obama.

making his summary remarks for the motion – Bjorn Lomborg, 

founder of the Copenhagen Consensus.  

BJORN LOMBORG 

Thank you.  It’s a little depressing to see that I started out telling 

you that we were gonna hear two arguments.  And indeed we 

have heard them.  One is that this is gonna be the end of the 

world and therefore we need to do whatever Oliver says.  I’m not 

really sure that’s such a great argument.  I would simply say we 

know from the U.N. Climate Panel that global warming will cause 

problems but it will not by any means be the end of the world.  It 

is one of the many problems we need to tackle and that’s exactly 

why we’re having this debate -- exactly asking, Is this worth the 

money or should we indeed do other things?  And that’s, of 

course, the other slightly sad thing, that it’s a false choice.  We 

can do everything but we don’t.  And so my question to you is 

really very, very simply, How do you want to be remembered?  Al 

Gore actually points this out very well.  He says, This is our 

generational mission.  He asks you, How do you want to be 

remembered by your kids and your grandkids?  I find it stunning 

that he would actually make that argument because the real 

question is, Do you want to be remembered for having spent 

hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars to do virtually no 

good a hundred years from now?

Or do you want to be remembered for actually having solved all 

the major problems that half of this world’s population suffers --  

these medieval, terrible tragedies that we are watching right now?  

This is really about how you want to be remembered.  And I hope 

you want to be remembered by doing a lot of good rather than 

just a little bit.  That’s what tonight’s decision is about.  That’s 

the tradeoff.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Bjorn Lomborg.  [APPLAUSE]  Arguing, summing – 

and Adam, can you see the clock?  I just want to make sure that 

it’s obvious to you.  Summing up against the motion, Adam 

Werbach, global CEO of Saatchi and Saatchi S.    

ADAM WERBACH  

John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club – he founded it in 1892 

– said that when you pick anything up by itself you find it hitched 

to everything else in the universe.  And that hitchedness is what I 

refuse to let go.  Mr. Lomborg, others say it’s a choice, that we 

can either create green jobs, that we can launch a new Apollo 

project, that we can’t do that and deal with poverty, global 

poverty, at the same time.  In fact, we have to.  And when you 

ask the question, How do you want to be remembered? – I don’t 

want to be remembered as a person who, to my three kids, as the 

one who saw a crisis facing us and who ignored it.  We can do 

something about this.  Mr. Stott says that, glibly, that people can

live in the Sahara, they can live to, in Greenland.  It makes it 

sound like you just need to put shorts on and that will deal with 

climate change.  It is more serious than that.  Mr. Huber 

describes himself as a technical utopian, but doesn’t want a 

system to regulate that technology in the end and to guarantee 

the marketplace for that.   

 

And that sounds to me quite familiar to marketing subprime 

loans but not having a strong enforcement mechanism, not 

having an SEC that could actually maintain the investment 

structures here in the United States.  More reductions in carbon 

emissions are worth the money.  And many of the anecdotes we 

shared tonight are examples of how they are worth the money.  

And the reason we used anecdotes is because we actually have 

examples of how it’s actually happening.  Now, you can deny 

that.  You can say those act...those aren’t real, and those don’t 

add up.  Or you can actually look at them.  And there is a reason 

why the world’s largest company went to China and told its 

thousand largest suppliers that it will pay more money if it has to 

build better products.  They want quality socks, not socks that 

fall down.  And those quality socks probably have less energy in 

them as well.  Major reductions in carbon are worth the money.  

We’re not going to do unintelligent things.  We’re going to spend it 

right.

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Adam Werbach.  [APPLAUSE]  Reminding you that 

the motion is:  Major reductions in carbon emissions are not 

worth the money, and making his final summary for the motion – 

Peter Huber, author of The Bottomless Well and a columnist for 

Forbes.    

PETER HUBER  

Well, and now I am done, I am going to get personal and nasty.  

And I’m going to talk to you over there, and you. [POINTING INTO 

THE AUDIENCE]  Yeah, you know who you are – and also you.  

And like a medieval priest, you know, there are carbon brokers 

out there today who will sell you an indulgence that will forgive 

all your carbon sins.  [LAUGHTER]   It will run you about five 

hundred dollars for five tons of carbon, which is about what the 

typical American needs – or about two thousand dollars per 

typical household.  Your broker will spend the money on 

something good – most likely cleaning up hog farms in Brazil.  

But if you really want to make a difference, you must send a 

check large enough to forgive four Brazilian households, too, 

because they can’t afford that.  So to cover all five households – 

the rich one and the four poor – make it four thousand dollars.  

And you probably forgot to send a check last year and who 

knows?, some of you might even forget it for the next eight years.  

Let’s cover all the sins, you know, one backed, this year’s and

eight in advance.  You’ll feel so much better if you’ve already paid 

for these future sins.  Let’s make it ten years, forty thousand 

dollars.  Now, if you honestly believe that substantial reductions 

in carbon emissions are worth the money, you will, sadly, vote 

against the proposition.  But then you must, you absolutely 

must, scurry right back home and send your check in because if 

you don’t you will have burdened your already sooty soul  

[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]  with an extra five tons of self-

righteous hypocrisy.  And you can’t possibly, [LAUGHTER]  you 

can’t possibly afford what it will take to forgive that.  [APPLAUSE]  

Your other --  [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]  Your other option, your 

other option is to keep your money in the pocket and vote for the 

proposition.  However desperately you may wish it were false, 

vote for because it is, in fact, a true statement of engineering and 

economic and geo-political fact.  And vote “for” because 

acknowledging reality is the essential first step in trying to 

change anything for the better.  [APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Peter Huber.  And with her two minutes to sum up, 

against the motion, Hunter Lovins, President and founder of 

Natural Capitalism Solutions.   

L. HUNTER LOVINS 

Boys, you’ve done a pretty good job of arguing what is essentially 

an untenable proposition.  [AUDIENCE REACTION]  Why is it

untenable?  Because the numbers are in.  Goldman Sachs, July 

two years ago, showed that the companies that are leading the 

way in cutting their emissions, in implementing energy efficiency 

have twenty-five percent higher stock value than their 

competitors.  The Economist Intelligence Unit, last February – the 

companies that are leading in this have the highest, fastest 

growing stock value and, conversely, the worst performing 

companies in the economy are most likely to have nobody in 

charge of these issues.  Deutsche Asset Management, Dr. Bruce 

Kahn:  This is a historic opportunity for the administration to 

take a global leadership position in energy while addressing the 

current economic and financial crisis.  He calls for a green 

national infrastructure bank investing in energy efficiency and 

renewables.   

 

He said, Spend on the green sweet spot -- efficiency in buildings, 

the new electric grid, renewables and public tranist.  He said, 

Credible scientific debate is over.  As more dynamic models of 

climate change are developed, we expect to see estimates of the 

danger of global warming increasing.  This is the business 

community, folks.  This is simply a better way of doing business.  

Now, you hold in your hands the future.  You can choose to vote 

for the finest thinking of the Twentieth Century or you can vote 

for the future.  You can vote to unleash this new energy

prosperity.  It matters what you vote now.  We have argued – and 

I think we’ve proven --  that cutting carbon is worth the money.  

We have not tried to argue that these investments will solve 

everything.  We have also argued – I have – that these are the 

investments that will deliver genuine development to the rest of 

the world.  So if you care about Bjorn’s position you will invest in 

these low carbon technologies.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Hunter Lovins.  [APPLAUSE]  And finally, summing 

up for the motion, Philip Stott, Emeritus Professor and Bio-

Geographer from the University of London.   

PHILIP STOTT 

Adam quoted a very great American.  I’d like also to relate to a 

northeastern great American – in fact, the very founder of the 

American ecological movement – George Perkins Marsh of 

Vermont, who wrote Men and Nature in 1864, one of the greatest 

books ever written.  And Professor David Lowenthal, also a great 

American author of the day, wrote something about him, which is 

extremely important for us to hear in the case of this debate.  

Environmental reformers who find nature’s inarticulate 

indifference unbearable impute their own aims to nature and 

then purport to speak on nature’s behalf.  A rarified natural 

world is then worshiped as virtuous.  And Marsh himself said, 

The equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a

problem for human intelligence to solve.  I think there was a 

mighty humility in Marsh’s view of nature, which actually we’ve 

forgotten today, which is vital.  ‘Cause what I am interested in is 

outcomes.  Will it work?  Remember the motion is major cuts.  

I’m really serious about this.  We agree on the influence that 

climate change will have impacts on people.  Of course it will.   

But what is really in the end going to work?  It’s got to work.  

That’s why Peter’s realism is absolutely essential to all this.  And 

back to Johnson to end.  He said, Why, sir, most schemes of 

political improvement are very laughable things, he said – which I 

think is an important way of always looking at it.  But finally, the 

limits of all that we’re doing here – also Johnson.  How small of 

all that human hearts endure that part which laws or kings or 

senates or congresses – I’ve added those --  can cause or cure.  In 

the end we want to solve this because we think it’s us.  I’m afraid 

it’s nature, greater than us, and we can’t in the end manage it as 

we wish we would.  Thank you.    

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  Thank you, Philip Stott.  [APPLAUSE]  And as their 

job is now done, I’d like to show some appreciation for our, our 

entire panel.  [APPLAUSE]  And it’s clear, given, I would say, the 

unusual level of passion that we heard in this debate tonight, 

that these panelists very, very seriously are vying for your votes 

and want to win.  And now comes the moment when you decide.

I want to remind you that before the debate sixteen percent were 

for the motion that:  Major reductions in carbon emissions are 

not worth the money.  Forty-nine were against, thirty-five percent 

were undecided.  Please pick up your key pads.  It’s time to vote 

again.  If you support the motion, press number one.  If you are 

against the motion, press number two.  If you remain or became 

undecided, press number three.  [PAUSE]    

 

Does anybody need more time?  Everybody’s good?  Cause we’re 

gonna lock out the system.  And we’ll have the results up to me 

in just a moment.  In the meantime, I want to tell you while the 

vote is being tallied that our next debate will be back at the 

Caspary Auditorium at the Rockefeller University.  That’s on the 

east side, if you don’t know.  The motion to be debated on 

Tuesday, February 3rd, is this:  The art market is less ethical than 

the stock market.  [LAUGHTER]   Panelists for the motion are 

Richard Feigin, Michael Hugh Williams and Adam Lindemann.  

Against the motion we have Amy Cappellazzo, Chuck Close and 

Jerry Saltz.  I hope that I’ll see many of you in a few weeks at the 

Caspary Auditorium.  And how close are we to having the paper 

come up?  Do you know, Joe?  Bob?  [PAUSE]  Okay, it’s on its 

way.  This can be a very brief talk amongst yourselves moment.  

[LAUGHTER]

And remember, the way that we measure victory in this is not 

where the room sits at the end but the dynamic of how the room 

moved.  And so those undecided votes are critically important.  

[PAUSE]  Here we go.  [PAUSE]  Well, it’s very interesting.  

[PAUSE]  Here are the final results from your poll on our motion 

that:  Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the 

money.  Before the debate sixteen percent of you were for the 

motion, forty-nine percent against and thirty-five percent were 

undecided.   After the debate, forty-two percent of you are for the 

motion, [APPLAUSE]  forty-eight percent are against and ten 

percent are undecided.  The side for the motion has moved  

[APPLAUSE]  more people, changed more minds.  

Congratulations to them.  [APPLAUSE]  And thank you, debaters.
