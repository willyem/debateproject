John Donvan: 
I’d like to welcome our panelists to the stage.   Round of applause. 
 
[Applause] 
 
I’ll introduce them in a moment but first I want to introduce the man who has made 
Intelligence Squared U.S. possible: Mr. Robert Rosenkranz.   The Rosenkranz 
Foundation; he started this four years ago in New York with the purpose of raising the 
public discourse in New York City.   We are a force to be reckoned with there.   This is 
our first foray outside and we are so pleased to be in the nation’s capital and so pleased to 
see so many of you.   So I would like to first of all, to welcome Robert Rosenkranz. 
 
[Applause] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate, to outline why we think the topic is 
important and why we feel they’re intellectually respectable arguments on both sides.   
So, in late 2009, computer operators in China gained access to Google’s computer 
network and obtained information about Chinese dissidents and about some of Google’s 
intellectual crown jewels including their development plans and they’re passwords and 
stuff.   Chinese military strategy emphasizes cyber espionage to obtain our military and 
technological know-how.   In the event of major conflict, they strive for the capacity to 
attack our home front, not by conventional arms but by disabling the vulnerable civilian 
computer systems that are essential to run our power systems, our telecommunications 
grids and our financial system.   And China by and large, has a huge interest in our 
success.   In contrast, terrorist groups have powerful motives to destroy our domestic

infrastructure, particularly if they can do so without a physical presence in the United 
States, why wouldn’t they.  
 
So the extraordinary complexity of our computer systems with their hundreds of millions 
of lines of code, make them very hard to defend.   The attacker needs to find only one 
weakness and the defender needs to find them all.   And then advance.  That's why so 
many of our military's best strategic thinkers consider cyber attacks our single biggest 
threat.  So what's the argument in favor of tonight's motion? Simply put, describing a 
worst-case does not make that case likely.  It may seem a sensible precaution to defend 
against a dire outcome, but first one needs to assess both risks and costs.   Apropos risks:   
How plausible is it that the Chinese or any other nation would attack our civilian 
computer infrastructure, even if they had the capacity to do so? By targeting civilians, 
might their military commanders risk committing war crimes? Wouldn't their strategists 
assume that we have the capacity to respond in kind? And how plausible is it that 
terrorists who can barely talk to each other on cell phones are capable of a serious cyber 
attack?  And apropos costs:  Consider the potential for the dead hand of government 
bureaucracy to stifle an invasion or to infringe our privacy.  Do we really want to give the 
folks responsible for airport security greater powers of surveillance? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Is cyber war a threat that we're not taking seriously enough? Or is it one we have 
exaggerated? It's a very important question for our nation, and we've assembled an 
extraordinary panel of experts to help you decide.  Before we begin, though, I want to say 
a word of thanks to WAMU in D.C. that's promoted this debate very, very heavily and is 
maybe responsible for a lot of you who are here tonight.  And -- but particularly, I'd like 
to introduce Jeff Ganek, the CEO of Neustar, which made this evening possible. 
 
And I hope you'll join me in applauding Neustar's generosity. 
 
[applause] 
 
Jeff Ganek: 
Thanks, Robert, and thanks to Intelligence Squared for taking this show on the road.  We 
at Neustar are delighted to have coaxed Intelligence Squared away from home in New 
York for the first time ever, bringing it here to Washington, D.C.  Clearly, just the packed 
house here tonight shows that there's a true hunger for intelligent and civil discourse 
that's Intelligence Squared's hallmark.  There's much the nation's capital can learn from 
Intelligence Squared, and we're excited for this evening to get started.  This is a timely 
topic, so I won't take up any more time.  Instead, I turn the stage over to John Donvan, 
and our distinguished panelists. 
 
John Donvan: 
Can I invite one more round of applause for both Robert and Jeff?

John Donvan: 
Welcome, everyone, to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan 
of ABC News, and once again it is my pleasure and my honor to serve as moderator, as 
the four debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the Newseum, and it's our first 
debate outside of New York City.  Four debaters, two against two, will be debating this 
motion: "The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated." Now, you in the audience 
have a special role, and I just want to divert very briefly while I talk about that.  We've 
already mentioned that WAMU is a partner in this evening, and they obviously did a 
very, very good job in bringing all of you out here on this evening.  And we are aware of 
the fact that Conan O'Brien who's doing his 30-city tour, this is his night in Washington, 
and we are aware of the fact that James Taylor and Carole King -- that doesn't happen 
very often -- they're singing together four blocks away. 
 
And mostly, we are aware of the fact that at National's Stadium, Steve Strasburg is taking 
the mound for the first time. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
So, the fact that all of you are here for a security policy discussion, debate in really, 
anywhere else but Washington, D.C. -- the words "wonk fest" will not escape my lips, 
but I do want to congratulate all of you for being here.  And here is the reason.  This is a 
debate.  It is a contest.  There will be winners and losers, and you, our audience, have a 
special role.  You are the judges.  By the time the debate has ended, you will have been 
asked to vote twice: once before and once again after the debate.  And the team that has 
changed the most of your minds on this motion will be declared our winner.  Let's go to 
the first vote now.  To the right of your seats, there is a keypad.  If you agree with our 
motion, "The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated," if you agree, push number 
one.  If you disagree, or if you're with the side that is arguing against, you push number 
two.  And if you’re undecided, push number three.  All right, looks like from everybody’s 
faces that we have passed that test.  So we’ll have the results in a short while.  We’ll 
share with you what the opening, what the preliminary vote is, after it’s tabulated.  And 
then once again at the end, we’ll go to the second vote and that’s how we’ll choose our 
winner.  So onto round one: opening statements by each debater in turn.  Seven minutes 
each.  Marc, you can make your way to your lectern.   I’d like to introduce arguing for the 
motion, that the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated, Marc Rotenberg who is 
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  He has been, since 
before most of us were familiar with the Internet, a fierce advocate for our privacy.  In 
fact, he has taken on internet behemoth Google, filing Federal Trade Commission 
complaints against Google on the grounds of possibly violating privacy.  That’s the kind 
of man he is; those are his issues; I’d like to introduce Marc Rotenberg, but I’m curious 
to know, do we need to worry more about China or you, if we’re Google?

Marc Rotenberg: 
Thank you so much John, and thank you all for being here tonight.  I wanted to begin also 
by thanking Intelligence Squared and the Rosenkranz Foundation and Neustar for hosting 
this event.  This is an important issue; this is one of those issues that’s being discussed 
here in Washington, in Congress and the White House and your views, your assessment 
of want the country should do with regard to the threat of cyber warfare is very important 
and we thank you for being here tonight.  We’re going to ask you tonight to consider the 
proposition of whether the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated.  Keep in 
mind the statement of the proposition.  We’re not talking about cyber attack, cyber 
concerns, cyber worry, or not being able to boot up your email.  This is a debate about 
cyber war and how serious that threat is.  I’d like to share with you a few statements that I 
uncovered as I was preparing for this debate.  One of the leading experts on cyber war 
said, “Digital Pearl Harbors are happening every day.”  The person who has been named 
to head the U.S. cyber command, the current director of the National Security Agency 
said “U.S. military networks are seeing hundreds of thousands of probes a day.”  And one 
of our opponents in the debate tonight has compared the threat of cyber warfare with 
nuclear war.  Now Bruce and I are going to try to explain to you why it is that we believe 
that these statements overstate the problem.  We are certainly aware of the full range of 
risks to the Internet and there are many different actors out there.  Some of them with 
criminal intent, some of them are spies; some of them are just curious. 
 
We used to call them hackers in the good ole days.  All of them pose various types of 
threat to the Internet as we know it, but if we reduce all of these threats to the catch-all of 
cyber war, I am concerned that it will take our country in a direction that we will very 
much regret.  But tonight we are not only going to try to persuade you that the threat of 
cyber war has in fact been grossly exaggerated, we are going to try to explain to you why 
this has happened.  In fact, what you are hearing now about the threat of cyber war is part 
of a long running campaign here in Washington to move control of the Internet, the 
technical standards and the openness that we have enjoyed away from its current model 
to one that would give the intelligence community and the National Security Agency 
much greater authority to decide what people may or may not do on the Internet.  And 
that effort has been underway long before the stories that you will hear tonight about 
Russian hackers and Chinese plans to take over the Internet and even attacks launched 
from North Korea.  Back in the 1970s, the NSA worried about the public availability of 
encryption; the key security standard that today makes possible the routine transactions 
you engage in when you buy a book on Amazon or download a song from iTunes. NSA 
didn't want that encryption technology widely available, and they fought against it.  
Fortunately, computer researchers pressed on, and encryption became widely available 
and provided a key technique to make possible secure online transactions. 
 
But then, in the 1980s, along came John Poindexter who would later come up with Total 
Information Awareness, and he worried about unsecured private computer networks -- 
does any of this sound familiar -- back in 1984.  And he wanted the National Security 
Agency to be responsible for computer security in the United States.  Fortunately, the 
Congress didn't like that idea.  They pressed back on Mr. Poindexter and the White 
House, and we established open standards to safeguard network security, but this is not 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

the end of the story.  Because then again in the early 1990s, as encryption was becoming 
more widely available and the NSA worried that they could not intercept private 
communications, they said to Internet users and American business, "You have to use a 
new technology that we've developed, called Clipper, the escrow key encryption 
standard.  Anytime you want to send a private e-mail, we need a copy of that key that you 
used to encrypt your communication because we want to be able to know what is 
contained in your private messages." And again, Congress pushed back and Internet users 
pushed back, and the Clipper chip proposal put forward by the NSA in the early 1990s 
was rejected.  The story continues.  After 9-11, NSA was there again arguing for control 
of the Internet to try to protect our nation against terror attacks.  Now, don't 
misunderstand our argument tonight.  We are aware of these threats, and we are not going 
to try to persuade you that there are not threats out there that are serious and real and that 
we should ignore.  That is not our argument.  Our argument is that we have to be very 
careful about allowing a single, secret, unaccountable government agency, which has 
been fighting for 25 years to take control of Internet security, to become the dominant 
authority for the Internet, which is what will happen if you accept the proposition that the 
threat of cyber war has not been grossly exaggerated. 
 
So, we urge you this evening not only to side with our side, to agree that this threat has 
been exaggerated, but also to understand why it has been exaggerated.  There are 
agencies in Washington that want very much to know what's in your e-mail.  They want 
to know when you log online.  They want to be able to build big databases and detect 
patters.  And this is the threat that Bruce and I will try to respond to.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Marc Rotenberg. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Our motion is, "The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated," and first up to argue 
against the motion, I'd like to introduce Mike McConnell.  Now, speaking about 
experience, not only was he a vice admiral in the Navy where he did a significant amount 
of intelligence work, he went on to become former director of national intelligence, 
making him the nation's top intelligence officer.  Also in his career, he was director of the 
National Security Agency.  Mike, does it get more inside than that? 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Well, a few things, not too many. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
But nothing you're going to share tonight.

Mike McConnell: 
Well, actually I am going to share a little bit of a story that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Terrific. 
 
Mike McConnell: 
-- goes with that long history. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael McConnell. 
 
Mike McConnell: 
The translation -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Thank you.  The translation of experience is age.  The bad news is age.  The good news is 
grandchildren.  But let me humanize just a second.  A little under the weather.  Two 
grandsons come to see me.  The oldest runs into the room and says, "Grandpa, Grandpa, 
make a sound like a frog." And I said, "Son, what for?" He said, "We're talking to 
Grandma and she said as soon as you croak, she's taking us all to Disney Land." 
 
[laughter] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
That's what age does for you.  Let me compliment Marc on his argument.  And I want to 
say up front, I agree with everything Marc said about the essence of what makes us 
Americans: privacy and civil liberties. 
 
However, I disagree and urge you to vote against this proposition because of how he 
framed it.  Let me just quote, “Our argument is do not let a single authority, the National 
Security Agency,” agency I was chosen to lead, “control the Internet.”  It has nothing to 
do - it has nothing to do with this debate.  Now-- 
 
[Applause] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
I want to just, if you’ll bear with me for just a second, just a small amount of time here; I 
want to make reference to people who are informed at the highest level with all of the 
information: our last three presidents.  President Clinton focused on this subject; he had a 
special panel review it and he concluded that it was critical to the nation that we move to 
address this set of vulnerabilities.  President Bush who I had the pleasure to serve along 
with serving President Obama, said, and I’ll just quote, “in the last few years, threats in 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

cyber security have risen dramatically.  The policy of the United States is to protect 
against the debilitating disruption of operations in our information systems for critical 
infrastructures.”  Later, when I had a chance to serve on the inside again, I made my case 
to President Bush and he supported a comprehensive national cyber security initiative.  
The Congress agreed and a bill was passed.  Now, we’ve got a new administration.  The 
new administration did not agree with the previous administration, huge policy 
differences in every dimension.  We made our case to President Obama and he said, “I 
will take it under review.”  After reviewing it for a considerable period of time, he said, 
one year ago, we meet today at a transformational moment, a moment in history, when 
our inter-connected world presents at once with great promise but also great peril. 
 
It’s the great irony of our information age, the very technologies that empower us to 
create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.  The key is 
disrupt and destroy.  I’m not talking about hackers.  I’m not talking about criminals, lots 
of statistics.  I’m not even talking about China and what China has done to take 
information out of this country.  I’m talking about destruction of data.  Let me give you 
just a way to think about it.  The United States economy is $14 trillion a year.  Two banks 
in New York City move $7 trillion a day.  On a good day, they do eight trillion.  Now 
think about that.  Our economy is $14 trillion.  Two banks are moving $7 trillion to $8 
trillion a day.  There is no gold; they’re not even printed dollar bills.  All of those 
transactions, all those transactions are massive reconciliation and accounting.  If those 
who wish us ill, if someone with a different world view was successful in attacking that 
information and destroying the data, it could have a devastating impact, not only on the 
nation, but the globe.  And that’s the issue that we’re really debating.  We are so inter-
connected; we have enjoyed the benefits of the information technology revolution.  It’s 
touched everyone in this room. From the time you got up this morning in an air 
conditioned space; you bought gasoline for your car with a credit card.  You do online 
banking; you have power routed to your home.  We’re on a path to increase the 
digitization of the country.  Medical care will be improved because of information 
technology.  We can move the information; we can understand trends and we can protect 
privacy.  And the arguments that our opponents are going to mount are this is an 
argument about privacy and civil liberties; it is not. 
 
We can have both.  I was privileged to serve the National Security Agency as its director.  
I was there for the debate over clipper chip and the other things that were mentioned.  
What I would encourage you to do, since I’m going to be out of time in just a second, is 
bring that topic up when we have a chance to have the dialogue with questions from the 
audience.  And I will tell the story from a little bit different perspective. I did serve on the 
inside; I have served on the outside, so I’ve had the privilege of seeing it from both sides.  
That’s not fair to you the audience, because I live in a classified world.  We have a 
system of representative government.  Those representatives that speak for you are 
cleared; they’re informed; their responsibility is oversight.   The equivalent of the 
National Security Agency was breaking Nazi Germany’s code in World War II.  
Historians argue that that probably shortened the war by 18 months to two years, saved 
countless lives and incredible resources.  Did the American people have the right to know 
that NSA was breaking Nazi Germany code in World War II? Because if they had 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

known, the Germans would have known, and all they had to do was take it away by 
changing the rotors.  Secrecy gets a very bad name in our society.  American citizens 
don't like spies in spite of the fact that the first spy master was George Washington.  
Secrecy is a necessity. 
 
[applause] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
And I would summarize by saying we have laws and the key is getting the law correct.  If 
the law is written appropriately and there is the appropriate oversight committee, if you 
violate the law, you will be held accountable.  In a nation as free and as wonderful as ours 
is, leading the world in human rights and privacy and civil liberties, it's getting the debate 
framed right to mitigate the risk, to protect the nation consistent with our values and our 
laws.  I urge you to vote against this resolution. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mike McConnell. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
So, we are halfway through the opening statements of this Intelligence Squared U.S.  
debate.  I'm John Donvan of ABC News.  We have four debaters, two teams of two, who 
are arguing out this motion: The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated.  You've 
heard the first two opening statements, now onto the third.  Bruce Schneier has a position 
in a company and also a position in the culture.  He is the chief security technology 
officer of BT, but he is more than that.  If you listen to him on any YouTube video, he is 
a thinker, he is a philosopher, a man who has taken the topic of security to the human 
soul, asking questions like what is trust and when do we know it and when do we 
recognize it.  So, he gets the title guru.  And I want to ask you since our radio audience 
can't see you, the ponytail, is that a guru thing, or do you just like it? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
Actually, I think it's an East Coast crypto thing. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Bruce Schneier.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
[applause] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
So, we're here today to debate the motion that the threat of cyber war is grossly 
exaggerated.  And I also, in preparing, read a book full of articles and have some choice 
quotes.  Mike McConnell said in an op-ed in the Washington Post in February of this 
year that the United States is fighting a cyber war today and we're losing.  So, cyber war 
is going on right now in our country.  Amit Yoran, who did cyber policy, cyber security 
under Bush, I believe, said that cyber 9/11 has happened over the past 10 years, but it's 
happened so slowly that we don't see it.  So, 9/11, you know, thousands of people dead, 
billions of dollars of damage, has happened, and we just didn't notice it like the cyber war 
we're currently losing.  In 2007, Germany -- and it's a great -- this is a great newspaper 
headline -- "Germany attacks China for starting the cyber war." 
 
This is actually great because when Germany attacks China, they are attacking them by 
yelling at them because China started a cyber war.  Another headline, same incident: 
"China declares war on western search sites." You can actually declare cyber war on 
search engines.  I don't know if you knew that.  An article from an Australian magazine, 
The Independent, February of this year: "Hackers declare cyber war on Australia." So, 
cyber war is so easy, even kids can do it. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
This year, London Times, March of this year: "Cyber war declared as China hunts for the 
West's intelligence secrets." And last year -- actually, Fourth of July last year there was a 
cyber war in the United States, headlines all over the place.  I have one from the Wall 
Street Journal: "Cyber blitz hits U.S. and Korea." In this instance, there were some 
denial-of-service attacks against Web sites in South Korea and the United States, which 
happen, we think, from North Korea.  There were a bunch of congressmen actually 
proposing that we attack Korea in response, except we think the attacks might have come 
from the U.K., which would have been awkward, or, actually, from Florida, which would 
have been really awkward. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
Okay, so this is silly, right? I mean, when we talk about cyber war in the headlines, in the 
rhetoric, we're not talking about war.  This is a rhetorical war, right?  It's the war on 
drugs, it's the war on poverty.  It's a really neat way of phrasing it to get people's 
attention, right, and to make an interesting headline.  Now, what's going on really is a 
blurring of the threats.  There are a lot of threats out there.  Cyber war is one, cyber 
crime; we’ve heard about cyber terrorism, cyber-hooliganism, cyber activism.  And it 
often can be really hard to figure out what’s happening.  And just think about how we 
respond to these sorts of threats. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
When something happens to us, it can be the response from the FBI or from the military 
or from the Secret Service or from Homeland Security and it depends on who’s attacking 
us and why.  And when we don’t know who’s attacking us and why, it can be very easy 
to call it war.  But in most cases, it’s not, right?  There’s a lot -- and -- I took quick notes, 
I probably got them wrong, some of McConnell’s statements, some of the quotes about, 
that we need to address the vulnerabilities, that the threats in cyber security have risen 
dramatically.  Again, we’re hearing -- yes these are true, there are threats, there are 
vulnerabilities; cyber security’s a big deal, but they’re not war threats.  Probably in the 
debate later, we’re going to go into some of the examples of cyber war.  I just mentioned 
Korea attacking the U.S.  A big one was in Estonia; it’s been called the first cyber war.  
And basically, someone or some country, some believe it’s Russia, announced a denial of 
service attack against a bunch of Estonia websites, so it’s kind of like the army marches 
into your country and then gets in line at the motor vehicle bureau so you can’t get your 
driver’s license renewed.  That’s sort of what that looks like.  The only person they’ve 
ever found who they can convict of this was a 22 year old Russian living in Tallinn who 
was annoyed about a statue falling down.  So I mean, we’re now where we can’t tell 
foreign invaders from bored kids.  The other events we talk about, China was mentioned 
a little bit.  I mean yes, there’s a huge intelligence threat.  China’s doing a lot of targeting 
against Google, against others.  Marc mentioned the enormous number of attacks per day 
against government networks.  That number actually is pretty reasonable for all of your 
computers as well. 
 
We’re talking about different worms and viruses; lots of threats, again not cyber war.  So, 
I urge you to really think critically about what we’re talking about.  Metaphors matter.  If 
we frame this discussion as a war discussion, then what you do when there’s a threat of 
war is you call in the military and you get military solutions.  You get lockdown; you get 
an enemy that needs to be subdued.  If you think about these threats in terms of crime, 
you get police solutions.  And as we have this debate, not just on stage, but in the 
country, the way we frame it, the way we talk about it; the way the headlines read, 
determine what sort of solutions we want, make us feel better.  And so the threat of cyber 
war is being grossly exaggerated and I think it’s being done for a reason.  This is a power 
grab by government.  What Mike McConnell didn’t mention is that grossly exaggerating 
a threat of cyber war is incredibly profitable.  The last article I saw said there’s about 
$400 million in Booz Allen contracts on cyber war.  You don’t get those by saying you 
know, this is kind of dumb.  But, it really is.  The threats are real; the threats are serious; 
cyber space is not a safe place, but these are not war threats.  For the threat of cyber war 
to be serious means you believe the threat of war is serious.  And if you’re not worried 
about war, 
 
[Applause] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
--you can’t be more worried about cyber war; that just doesn’t make sense.  I guess I’ll be 
back when it’s discussion time.

[Applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Bruce Schneier.  Our motion is, “The cyber war threat has been greatly 
exaggerated,” and now to argue against that motion I want to introduce Jonathan Zittrain 
who is a professor of Internet Law at Harvard, who a couple of years back, said the great 
thing about teaching Internet law is that those who study it don’t really know what it is 
yet. 
 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
I thought it was that they taught gym. 
 
John Donvan: 
I got the quote wrong.  Have things changed? 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Well. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jonathan Zittrain. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Thank you. 
 
[Applause] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Thank you so much.   Thank you to the Rosenkranz Foundation, Intelligence Squared, 
and thank you Bruce for promising not to hack the voting devices that we're using tonight 
in the program. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
So, here's where we're at so far.  Marc says, "Vote for us if you don't want a police state." 
Bruce says, "Vote for us if you think journalists and their headline writers and sometimes 
their sources exaggerate," and, "Vote for us if you don't want a military state." So, I stand 
here proudly before you in the negative, despite the fact that I do not want a police state.  
I do think that journalists and their headline writers sometimes exaggerate -- is it okay to 
say that in the Newseum? Is that all right? 
 
[Applause] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - 6/8/2010

Did you see, by the way, if you're particularly a fan of the news, you can live here.  There 
are Newseum residences, which is -- 
 
[Laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
There's like a bat pole and you can go down and read the headlines.  I can't believe I've 
just used a minute in this opening, but -- and we all agree that the use of the word "cyber" 
is probably a bridge too far.  If you at least agree with that, please send me -- 
 
[Applause] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Yes.  You can applaud or send me some cyber mail, and I will send you a reply.  What 
we heard from Mike were some scenarios that were kind of the watershed event 
scenarios, and I don't know about you, but after his rip on the banking system, I might be 
going to my nearest ATM and purchasing a brand-new hollow mattress. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
I want to give a more gradual view of the vulnerabilities that you'll notice both Bruce and 
Marc handily acknowledge.  "Oh, we're not saying the system works.  In fact, we agree 
it's utterly vulnerable.  We just don't like the use of the word 'war,' and we don't like the 
use of the word ‘war' because it might give people a platform through which to have bad 
things happen after that, to militarize or to create a police state or something like that." 
Well, fine.  We have to argue against that, but let us be truth-tellers about the state of 
vulnerability in our networks and our endpoints, and then deal with it from there, neither 
exaggerating nor understating it. 
 
So, what kind of threat am I talking about? Let me just give you two quick examples.  
The network itself.  The Internet is an utterly bizarre network, and to answer your 
question, John, the more I study it, the more I am just agog that it functions at all.  And 
there are plenty of Internet engineers who -- 
 
[Applause] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
-- remain puzzled and say, well, it's just a pilot project.  The jury's still out. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
So, for example, to get a piece of data from one end to another, like this pen up to the 
back of the room, the sane, rational way to do it would be to hire somebody, to have a 
Newseum employee who would take it up there, and then if it didn't get there, we would 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

know whom to blame.  Call it the FedEx method of getting it there.  The way the Internet 
does it is basically like a big bucket brigade.  I pass it to the front row, it goes back, 
would you mind, would you mind, or for sports fans, kind of like beer at a Red Sox game, 
right? 
 
[Laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
You gain nothing except soiled trousers by doing it, but there is a strong normative 
presumption that you will pass the beer. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
[Applause] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Now, this also leads to structural vulnerability, because if you drink the beer or if you 
pass it forward instead of sideways, it doesn't get to where it's going.  And it turns out 
that in 2008, the state of Pakistan, as is its wont, asked its Internet service providers to 
prevent people in Pakistan from getting the YouTube.  There was something there that 
they didn't like.  And one ISP, as kind of a parlor trick, chose to implement that block by 
announcing within the stands of fans that are ISPs here, that it, in fact, was YouTube.  
And this is a decentralized system.  So, its announcement meant that packets that would 
otherwise be going to YouTube went to them from their subscribers.  And then it 
resonated like ripples in a pond from one ISP to another like dominoes until with about 
two minutes, anywhere in the world, if you were trying to get to YouTube, your packets 
were going to Pakistan and they weren't coming back.  Now, that is not only downright 
weird, it is an example of just a whole genus of vulnerabilities that are extremely difficult 
to fix. 
 
Now, was that an act of war?  Definitely not.  Is it a vulnerability such that if you had 
malice towards a state that relies asymmetrically on this network and decided that you 
wanted to use this as an instrument of your aggression, could you do so? Absolutely, and 
I do not believe you will hear them say otherwise.  That's why you hear Bruce saying 
against the straw people of "there's a cyber war already in progress." All right, I don't 
think there's a cyber war going on right now against us in America, but boy are the 
vulnerabilities there.  So long as there is the vulnerability, all we need is the motivation, 
and I don't want to rest on the good graces of any state around the world, or for that 
matter any 12-year-old, that wants to try to take down the net.  And, he's not 12, but I did 
ask Ed Felten, computer scientist at Princeton, once, I said, "You know, if you're in a 24-
like scenario and your life depended on it, and you had to bring down huge swathes of the 
net and you only had a week to do it, kind of planting the seeds in the head I said could 
you do it.  And he thought about it really careful, and he said, could I have two weeks?  
And that’s the kind of thing that did not make me feel better.  Now, Robert Rosencranz, 
one of our hosts, mentioned GhostNet, our collaborators in the Open Net initiative at 
Toronto and up at Harvard, worked to expose this network that they named GhostNet

where basically this wasn’t run of the mill Trojans that all of us have right now on our 
machines while we think we’re playing solitaire and in fact our machines are spamming 
each other.  This isn’t a run of the mill Trojan; these are the ones targeted to particular 
people and institutions that a government might have interest in, compromising the 
machines and leaving them open on average for over 200 days, where they’ve got the 
keys to the kingdom.  They can surveil everything; they can control the machine.  How 
do we know?  Because our researchers hacked that system and then could see what they 
saw.  We saw the ministries of foreign affairs of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, the 
Philippines, and Brunei, open to us, if all we wanted to do was grab the files. 
 
The embassies of Germany, Romania, Cyprus, the Associated Press, not the embassy, the 
Associated Press itself, and NATO headquarters, exposed through our view of this 
system.  That’s something that says to me, to the extent that surveillance and spy craft is 
an instrument of war, war is what you have.  So I am concerned as, is I think everybody 
here about protecting civil liberties, about not having the responses to this problem be too 
quick, too panicked, too corporate, or too military.  There are solutions that I hope we can 
talk about in the panel, to avoid too far in any of those directions.  But let us be clear 
about the problem.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Jonathan Zittrain. 
 
[Applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion 
being argued is the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated.  And we now have the 
results of our preliminary vote where you, our live audience are judges in this debate, 
registered your stance on this motion before the debate began.  Here are the numbers.  
Our motion is the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated.  Before the debate, 24 
percent of you agreed with you motion, 54 percent disagreed, and 22 percent were 
undecided.  That’s where things started; we will ask you to vote once again at the 
conclusion of the debate and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared 
our winner.  Now, on to round two where the debaters address each other directly and 
answer questions from the audience and from me.  We have here in Washington D.C. at 
the Newseum, two teams of two.  We have Marc Rotenberg, the security activist, and 
Bruce Schneir, the security specialist and internet philosopher who are arguing that the 
other side’s argument really is a red herring intended to lead to a power grab by the 
military. 
 
The side arguing against is saying that we are terribly vulnerable to a list of 
vulnerabilities and that the stakes are enormously high if the damage were done, the 
damage would be something that we almost could not recover from.  I’m John Donvan 
moderating and I have an initial question and my question is to the side that is arguing for 
the motion.  You have heard what the other side has said and you have described what 
you have heard as not being a situation that deserves to be described as war, but what 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

kind of collection of vulnerabilities or what sort of action would actually be for you, be 
an unexaggerated threat of cyber war.  What would it take for you to abandon this 
motion? 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
I guess for cyber war, you need war. 
 
John Donvan: 
Bruce Schnier. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
So tanks would be nice.  Maybe some bombs.  It’s -- one of the rhetoric we hear is a 
cyber Pearl Harbor, which is an opening salvo to cyber war.  I’m thinking of a fleet; that 
would work.  
 
John Donvan: 
Bruce, the motion isn’t there is a war.  The motion is about a threat. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
Right, what I would need to see for cyber war; I guess I would need nation hostilities that 
are warlike.  I mean, I would have to be fearful of war.  I would have to be fearful that 
Canada would roll over into the United States.  Now if I was worried Canada would do 
that, I would worry about Canada’s cyber command and cyber capabilities, and I would 
worry about the cyber threats from Canada.  As long as I feel safe against war, I just 
don’t think the subset of war is going to bother me.  So you’re talking about damage we 
can hardly recover from.  A lot of that happens by accident.  We saw -- it was a couple 
years ago, three undersea cables were cut going into Egypt.  Now, this was kind of a 
weird coincidence maybe, or maybe it was some kind of intelligence action. 
 
But that's a pretty big threat.  You can imagine that as a war-type threat.  And it was 
something that was recoverable from.  The power blackout in 2003 hit I think D.C., the 
northeast part of the United States, southeast part of Canada.  You know, that was a series 
of events.  One of them seems to have been the Blaster Worm.  I mean, the guy who 
wrote the worm couldn't have predicted on a bet that that would have resulted in that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me bring -- 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
But [unintelligible] cyber action.  But again, it's a war. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me get a response from Mike McConnell on the other side. 
 
Mike McConnell: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

Thank you very much, John.  When Bruce spoke at the beginning, he said, "Mike 
McConnell said the U.S. is fighting a cyber war today, and we are losing."  That’s not in 
fact exactly what I said.  What I said is if we were in a cyber war, we would lose.  And I 
was making that statement somewhat metaphorically.  And let's think about the terms 
we're using: cyber war, Cold War.  Did we have a Cold War?  For those of you in the 
audience about my age, you probably really experienced that.  The issue is there was a 
Cold War.  We had a nation state who, if the United Nations banged on the podium and 
said, "We will bury you," there were risks, and we prepared.  When we prepared, we 
prevailed.  We won the Cold War.  And if I had to do it over again, maybe I would use 
the word conflict or battle as opposed to war.  So I want to highlight we're talking about 
the threat.  There are vulnerabilities.  They cannot be denied.  Every member of this panel 
in this debate would agree that there are huge vulnerabilities.  So what my partner and I 
are attempting to be are truth sayers, as he said, provide the warning to cause our citizens 
to recognize the vulnerability and cause their government, their businesses and their 
personal behavior collectively to address these vulnerabilities so that if there's a war we 
would prevail.  One last thing, John.  Desert Storm shocked the Chinese, shocked them. 
 
They had an army that was totally unprepared.  In Desert Storm, one weapon destroyed 
target.  Any time in history with thousands of weapons, from Desert Storm till today, the 
Chinese are building an army and a capability to take out the cyber capabilities of the 
United States, take out the eyes and ears, our strategic advantage.  That's what is 
currently going on in this capture of information, moving terabytes of data. 
 
John Donvan: 
Marc Rotenberg, I mean, some of this can turn into a little bit of a semantic tangle. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
Right. 
 
John Donvan: 
But Mike McConnell brought up an interesting semantic move when he said cyber war, 
Cold War.  The Cold War didn't turn into actual combat and invasions, and yet we all 
know what that meant.  Respond to that, please, whether that works or not. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
Yeah, I don't think it works.  And I think the point that Bruce was driving at is, look, 
when we talk about war, war, we're talking about one nation state going after another 
nation state with the intent to decimate its economy, you know, overrun its land, you 
know, threaten its people.  That's what war is about.  And in Washington, even when 
we're at war, we're reluctant to say we're at war.  So we use this word, you know, very, 
very carefully.  And if I could have just one more moment, I'm actually a little bit 
surprised by some of Mike McConnell's earlier comments about the role of the NSA in 
all of this.  He seemed surprised that I was talking about the NSA in my opening remarks 
and the context of this debate.  But this debate is entirely about the role of NSA.  And the 
Congress knows this because it was the NSA director who recently went before the 
Congress to be nominated as the head of US cyber command.  This person is now 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

responsible for coordinating the military response for the United States in the area of 
cyber security.  It didn't have to be the NSA.  It could have been the Department of 
Homeland Security.  It could have been the commerce department.  It could have been -- 
well, stay with me on this, will you?  It's an option, right? 
 
It's an option.  But there is an obvious reason.  You know, and all of Mike's family and 
friends who are here tonight siding with him understand what I'm talking about.  This 
argument for cyber war is an argument for the Department of Defense for the National 
Security Agency to take the lead on cyber security in the United States.  And this is a 
debate we've had now for 25 years.  And what I tried to do in my opening statement was 
to remind all you folks what our experience with that has been.  It's the experience of 
clipper.  It's the experience of classified responses. 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to -- since you're going back to your opening statement, let me interrupt and go 
to Jonathan Zittrain to respond to what you just heard. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Well, a little bit, there is a little bit of philosophical thing going on here where it's like is 
this a chair?  You know, like, well, it has three legs and not four.  And I never saw 
somebody sit on it, but you could.  And I mean, you know, the boundaries of a chair gets 
fuzzy.  So what makes a war a war?  Well, we've heard a couple things.  Who are the 
actors involved?  If the person initiating the hurling of a stone at someone is a state actor, 
could it be a war?  Well, if the stone hit somebody from another state, if a South Korean 
soldier in the demilitarized zone hurls a stone at his North Korean counterpart, squarely 
trying to hit him, is that an act of war?  Is that an act of war, Mike? 
 
Mike McConnell: 
I think it might be. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
I think it might be too. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Let's just say that we should not try that experiment right now.  You know?  Worse has 
happened on that peninsula, and it started from lesser things.  And then you look, all 
right, what's the motive and what's the effect?  Now, what I hear is, yes, the canonical, 
platonic form of war is like the digital representation -- this is for a younger generation.  
In the “Lord of the Rings” series, when all those monsters are going up against each 
other, all right, that's a war. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

Right?  That's a Platonic form.  But you can take away a leg or two and still have the 
fundamental truth be, one, are we exposed? 
 
Absolutely.  And what are we exposed to?  It may not be a bomb coming down our 
middle chimney of our house, but it could be something that greatly affects our way of 
life.  If you indulge Mike's hypothetical and say what if tomorrow those two banks could 
be taken out, and suddenly everybody that had some claim to those $7 trillion has no idea 
to whom it belongs, nor can they prove it.  Seems to me that's a predicate with the right 
actors in place to be an act of war. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jonathan, this seems to boil down to -- and I don't want to get into this rhetorical tangle 
here. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
But the word "threat" is in there, and it seems to -- 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- the word "threat" means something that could happen.  And the question is you are 
saying we should be really, really, really, worried about what could happen.  And you're 
saying not so much.  And you're saying they have motives for trying to scare us.  But are 
you ever -- and you know what damage can be done.  Bruce, that's what you do for a 
living is protect -- is protect a company.  Are you -- are you able to sleep at night in terms 
of the stuff that could happen? 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
So this is actually interesting.  As security guys, we tend to think all about the bad stuff.  
But, I mean, you go out in the audience, your bank account's actually fine, all right?  
Your identity hasn't been stolen tonight.  We talk a lot about the threats.  And in my 
business, we have conferences on the threats.  You write papers on the threats.  All we do 
is threats.  But actually most of the world works pretty well pretty much all the time.  The 
internet works.  The pens go to the back of the room, the beer gets passed, and life goes 
on.  Yes, there are vulnerabilities, but the networks, right, I mean sure -- yes, there's 
espionage going on.  A lot of companies keep a lot of secrets?  So, yeah, it's easy to sleep 
at night because we are safe.  By and large, we are safe.  Yes, there are threats.  There are 
common threats.  I mean, you could look at the number of -- amount of money stolen 
from identity theft, right, some cyber crime.  And it's a big number.  But it's a much 
bigger number, money that isn't stolen.  Yes, there's bad stuff going on, but it's rare.

It's in the noise.

We are safe.  Three very important words.  Are we -- Jonathan, respond to are we safe? 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
No, we are not safe. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
I wanted to put to Bruce the question I said I put to Ed.  Bruce, if you had a crack team, 
NSA left you a team of good spooks, and you have two weeks -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
-- not signing them up just yet.  You have two weeks, and you have to wreak maximum 
havoc among the devices in consumer land.  The people you just told should feel safe in 
their homes and businesses.  You have to wreak maximum havoc.  I know it's against 
interests to answer it.  But tell me just how far could you go? 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
So, we talk about this.  And actually, after -- in crypto conferences, security conferences, 
people get beers at the end of the night.  And we have these conversations.  And -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
-- I mean, there's a side that -- 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
This is just among us here. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
Right.  There's a side that says, well, you know, new introduction of a Microsoft 
operating system is indistinguishable from a big denial of service attack. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

So, you know, you've got these sorts of things happening -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
We have these things happening sort of normally.  We had an AT&T satellite go out 
because of software updates, and a lot of people's pagers didn't work.  These sorts of 
things do happen.  You can do damage but we recover.  We're actually really good at 
recovering.  And I don't think given two weeks and a crack team, you could take down 
the internet.  You could make people real annoyed.  You can make -- actually probably 
get paid overtime -- but the techies who have to fix their computers and networks are 
going to have a bunch of sleepless nights, but it's not going to take down the -- it's not 
going to do irreparable damage to our country, to our society.  This is not an existential 
threat.  I mean, nothing like that; this is around the edges. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  I want to in a moment go to questions from the audience, so I want to start that 
process.  We'll get the microphones out there and once again I want to remind you to hold 
the microphone a fist's distance away from your mouth, to really ask a question that is a 
question, and to try to keep it on our topic, and we'll come to you in just a moment.  But 
Mike McConnell, I want to give you a chance to respond to what you just heard. 
 
Mike McConnell: 
I want to go back to the word, "war," and just remind the audience, Cold War, there were 
no Russians marching down Pennsylvania Avenue until we won. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
And they were on the friendly side.  So this -- careful of the use of the word "war."  Marc 
said that's a nation state attacking another nation state, we did not exchange nuclear 
weapons with the Soviets.  We prevailed in that war.  It's the metaphor of war.  Now, 
also, Marc, earlier in our introduction, accused me of tapping his telephone, and he also 
just made reference to me stacking the audience with family and friends. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Now, I would love to have done that however it is against the law -- it is against the law 
to tap Marc's telephone -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
You got it. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - 6/8/2010

Mike McConnell: 
-- unless he is guilty of a crime, and that goes completely out of the context of the 
National Security Agency and becomes a law enforcement issue which is controlled by a 
judiciary process. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mike, let me bring to you a question that actually goes to the issues that concern Marc.  
There is a bill that's sort of sitting in the Senate, a lot of cyber -- to address cyber threat, 
and one of the provisions in the bill was to give the president the power to disconnect a 
company or to disconnect even a government agency from the Internet if he thought it 
was a threat.  And ultimately that provision slipped away because of pressure from 
groups like Marc.  Do you think it was a mistake for that provision to go away?  If you -- 
 
Mike McConnell: 
No, I do not.  I do not.  But let me just add a little more context, there are now 40, 40 -- 
four zero -- bills, resolutions, or amendments on the Hill circulating, and let me remind 
you of what Mark Twain said about that. 
 
No man's life, liberty, or property are safe while the legislature is in session. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
This is a debate that involves you in this room, the citizens, being informed about this 
process, the scare tactics of the government tapping your telephone; that cannot happen 
with the right law. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
Oh, my God. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
It cannot happen without the right -- without the law. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
Does the phrase “warrantless wiretapping" mean anything this evening? 
 
[applause] 
 
Mark Rotenberg: 
I mean, come on, Mike, let's be serious.  The past administration violated the U.S. 
Constitution and you pushed for --

[talking simultaneously] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Is it appropriate to be interrupted -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah.  Actually, I -- 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
-- that no one would be held accountable. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- all of that may be true but it's actually a different debate. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
That's an incredible statement. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
That's a different debate.  And, Mike, I want to go back to the question -- 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
But we should go to that debate.  That's what this debate is. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
[unintelligible] we'll be back and we'll book it. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
Notice that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I want you to go to my question, why don't you want to give the president the power to 
do this?  Because the president can put troops on the street, he can close down ports, why 
not give the president the power to -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Notice that Marc came for a different debate.  Now, let me answer your question. 
 
[laughter]

You don't want to concentrate that kind of power with a bill on the Hill that is not thought 
out.  My argument is this is very, very complex.  My opposition here made reference to 
my comments about Cold War and nuclear weapons.  The reason I made that reference is 
we didn't know what to do with nuclear weapons.  We didn't know how to control them.  
We didn't know what our doctrine would be and so on.  So in the late '40s, early '50s, we 
had the best minds in this country -- it was called the Solarium Project -- two things came 
out of that work, containment and nuclear deterrence.  And what it said was never ever 
use them.  It built the framework which allowed us to prevail in the Cold War.  And that's 
the argument I'm making here.  It's not about warrantless surveillance, easy to say, hard 
to refute. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, I'd like to go to some questions from the audience now and, sir, with the 
microphone.  Thank you for being there. 
 
And I apologize that I didn't meet you before and know your name, but there's a 
gentleman in a blue shirt, and if you can rise, sir -- thank you.  And I just want to wait 10 
seconds so that the cameras can find you and I think that’s probably good.  Okay.  Go 
ahead, please. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Good evening.  This question is primarily for Mr. Schneier and Mr. Rotenberg.  We’ve 
heard a lot of examples tonight about nefarious cyberspace activity as the defining event 
itself, but I think we’ve seen examples of nefarious cyberspace activities as part a more 
conventional conflict, when Russia invaded I believe it was Georgia.  Is it grossly 
exaggerated to believe that nefarious cyberspace activities might be used as part of a 
more conventional conflict against the U.S. or one of our allies and if that is grossly 
exaggerated, who should be in charge of ensuring that our networks are not overrun in 
that event? 
 
John Donvan: 
At least take part one of that question, yes.  Mr. Schneier. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
I think it would be silly of anyone to think that any future war will not include a 
cyberspace theater, all right?  War encompasses all theaters: land, water and air space, 
cyberspace.  War will fill the available space. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
This side agrees. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

So yes, so if there is war, there will be a cyber component.  Georgia’s interesting.  So 
Georgia was an actual tanks rolling in invasion and there were some website deface -- 
non-service attacks.  We don’t actually know who did that.  You know a lot of what 
we’re talking about, we talk about cyber wars, are kids playing politics.  And you see it.  
You see Israel and Palestine, you saw U.S. and China, you know, when the U.S. spy 
plane had to land in China a bunch of years ago.  I saw India-Pakistan when the sort of 
nuclear tests were going on.  I mean, you see this all the time that it’s cyber-activism, it’s 
kids playing politics and we actually don’t know.  It’s sort of odd to think that as you’re 
rolling in tanks you’re going to make it so people can’t visit some website. 
 
They’re probably not paying attention to that right now.  But if you’re someone who’s 
rooting for your side, that’s what you can do.  So, yeah, it’s hard to know what these 
things were but any future war will certainly include a cyber component. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jonathan, do you have anything to add to that that moves it from where we are? 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Well, we actually saw in the recent Russia-Georgia conflict a number of Georgian blocks 
on the web.  We infer that it might be the Georgian government actually trying to keep 
some of its own people from getting some of the bad news too early but certainly a 
component of that war was a cyber strategy.  And we’ve seen it in other instances, 
whether it’s disputed elections or other things actually attacking cyber infrastructure 
because information is really key and if people are confused and they don’t know what’s 
going on and they’re relying on the Internet, they tossed their television set or they don’t 
know how to work it, that’s a problem. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
Right.  I mean, Iran’s an example of that, the elections in Iran.  A lot of the information 
came out in cyberspace.  Iranian government’s trying to block it and, you know, activists 
around the world trying to counter that.  I mean, lots of great stuff.  Not exactly war, but 
they were good things. 
 
Mike McConnell: 
John, could I add some-- 
 
John Donvan: 
Mike McConnell 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Let me add just a couple of facts about the Russian conflict.  That cyber -- those cyber 
attacks were deliberate.  I agree with the way that Bruce is describing it.  There was a lot 
of piling on.  But what happened was deliberate, it was rehearsed ahead of time and it 
was effective in shutting down the Georgian government and the Georgian government 
was defeated.  The Russians achieved their objective and that’s an example of how you 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

would interface in a current conventional conflict the ability to attack the other side’s 
capability to communicate, to coordinate, to integrate their forces.  The Georgians lost. 
 
John Donvan: 
We have a question in the front row so if you could stand up, and the microphone is on its 
way. 
 
Male Speaker: 
So, Jonathan Zittrain in his opening remarks mentioned that the Internet is broken, that 
people are running protocols that are insecure, and that’s it’s easier for a malicious or 
incompetent service provider in Pakistan to direct all of the world’s YouTube traffic to 
that provider.  And I think Bruce and many others would agree that many consumers and 
people are running out of data protocols on out of date software.  We’re not hearing, 
though, any calls for increasing National Science Foundation funding or any calls for -- 
 
Jonathan Donvan: 
So what’s your question?  
 
Male Speaker: 
The question is if the problem is that we’re running out of date software or the problem is 
that we have an insecure internet, why are we not calling for secure software and 
regulation of technology companies rather than giving power to the DOD and NSA who 
have never done anything to fix the Internet or fix security problems? 
 
[applause] 
 
Male Speaker: 
NSA is in the business of finding flaws, not fixing flaws. 
 
Jonathan Donvan: 
All right.  The part of your question that I want to bring to Mike because it’s entirely 
unfocused is that the government has never done anything to protect the Internet.  Is that 
true? 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Let's start with the fact that DARPA invented the internet.  So that's a good start place. 
 
[applause] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
There are two organizations that -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
It wasn’t their job to secure it. 
 
Mike McConnell: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

True, because it was designed to be open and unassailable.  However, it is what it is.  
There are two organizations that make encryption code for the federal government.  One 
is the National Security Agency to protect secrets, and the other is the national institute of 
standards and technology for unclassified protection.  There is an initiative calls CNCI, 
comprehensive national cyber security initiative, and it does exactly what you just said it 
didn't do.  It is to direct funding into the national science foundation, produce a cyber 
corps, now it's a word, cyber corps.  What does that mean?  It means teaching kids double 
E and computer science and understanding so they can make this process better.  If you're 
old enough to remember Sputnik -- 1957, most of you probably don't remember that.  
Immediately after, we had a bill that started sending kids to school for double E and 
computer science. 
 
I went to college on that bill.  Otherwise I would have been not able to go.  So this debate 
is about doing what you just said.  It's not about accusing NSA of spying and warrantless 
surveillance or saying DOD doesn't do its job.  It's about a debate that causes us to invest 
the resources and train our people so that we can securely rely on something we have 
become dependent on. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sir, what do you think of Marc Rotenberg's concerns with the sorts of measures that you 
seem to be asking for when you said the government isn't doing anything about it is the 
sort of -- would invite the kinds of government interference that he finds scary and 
terrifying.  I'll bring the mic back to you.  I'm sorry. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Well, I didn't say terrifying, exactly. 
 
John Donvan: 
You didn't.  And I -- totally, you didn't.  And that's a very good point. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
The threat of him saying terrifying has been totally exaggerated. 
 
John Donvan: 
And I -- if you can be brief.  But he's concerned that the sorts of remedies that I think that 
you're asking for could be disastrous for privacy. 
 
Male Speaker: 
I think Marc is scared of the NSA which is not subject to any oversight.  I don't think he's 
scared of a transparent process to improve internet security. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
Okay.  So let me clarify.  Tonight's debate topic’s not whether or not Marc's scared, 
okay? 
 
[laughter] 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Marc Rotenberg: 
We're not going to go there.  We're having a policy discussion, a very important policy 
discussion.  And I'm still having a little difficulty following what Mike McConnell is 
saying.  He said the NSA is not interested.  They're not going to get involved, not a big 
deal.  A couple months ago, in The Washington Post, he's writing we need to develop an 
early warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions, locate the source of 
attacks.  And we must be able to do this in milliseconds.  And then you say we need to 
reengineer the internet to make attribution, geo location, intelligence analysis and impact 
assessment, the result more manageable.  This is exactly -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But I think he -- I think he's fessing up to all of this. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
Yes, but here's the point about it, okay?  And this is why this is a very important question. 
 
If the goal were to promote security, reliability, stability the way we talked in the internet 
community about responding to security threats, we would have unclassified programs.  
We'd be doing education and training.  We'd be responding to user concerns.  But that's 
not the model that we're moving forward now.  In fact the model that Mike just described 
a moment ago, the CNCI is a classified document prepared by President Bush.  He was 
there at White House meeting in 2008.  We're still trying to get public disclosure of that 
document because right now we have a secret cyber security policy.  We can't even talk 
about it.  I mean, we can imagine what's in it, but we don't even know what the document 
says.  Mike knows what the document says, but we don't. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Can I just say -- can I just say -- 
 
Mike McConnell: 
It's posted on the White House website if you'd like to read it. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
No, not the original document. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jonathan, can you be brief, because I want to move on. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
No, no, no.  Don't say that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain:

Sorry. 
 
Bruce Schnier: 
Yay.  Nobody drink the beer.

So I'm pleased to announce that the internet works. 
 
John Donvan: 
I really hope your question is excellent.  Otherwise the internet's failed. 
 
Male Speaker: 
This question is for the team against the motion.  Mr. Schneier brought up recovery, and I 
think this is a key difference between real war and so-called cyber war.  Would you care 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

to comment on the difficulties of the two compared to each other, recovery from a 
physical war and a cyber war? 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
I guess that's for one of us. 
 
John Donvan: 
Who did you -- 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
I'll take a crack at it first, I suppose.  First, note that our brethren in the affirmative set the 
bar at, does this create an existential threat to the country.  That bar is too high, otherwise 
what happened in Grenada I dare say was not a war, although I think Grenada may have 
thought otherwise; or Panama, or you name other conflicts that need not have existential 
dimensions.  As I understand it, even the war of 1812, yeah, they burned down the White 
House, but, you know, they didn't actually threaten the entire integrity of our country.  So 
we want to go short of existential threat.  When I think of a war, what I think of is a 
hostile act designed to harm quite often, and typically physically, but not always, the 
interests, livelihood and, you know, day to day existence of the target.  And that is most 
certainly possible in cyberspace.  And when you see it happening because a 12-year-old 
can do it, it's like, yes, but it's not the Chinese.  It's like, well, that does not make me sleep 
any better at night. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I have to do a little thing for the radio and television at this point.  It will be 
very brief.  I want to remind you, we are in round two of this Intelligence U.S. squared 
debate.  I'm John Donvan of ABC News.  We have four debaters, two teams of two.  
We're Marc Rotenberg and Bruce Schneier who are arguing for the motion, “the cyber 
war threat has been grossly exaggerated.”  And arguing against that motion, Mike 
McConnell and Jonathan Zittrain.  Oh, I mispronounce -- somebody in my ear -- the 
person who tells me everything to say. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
The NSA. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- has told -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
I have to do it a second time.  I apologize. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
The voices in your head have a friends and family plan.

John Donvan: 
There's always been a voice in my head.  I slurred.  We are in round two of this 
intelligence US squared debate.  I am John Donvan of ABC News, your moderator. 
 
We have four debaters. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
You said “debaters” right. I counted four. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
We are in round two of this intelligence squared US debate.  I am John Donvan of ABC -
- I have to do it without everybody laughing. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
We are in round two of this intelligence squared US debate.  I'm John Donvan of ABC 
News.  We have four debaters, two teams of two who are debating this motion, "The 
cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated."  And we are going to questions from the 
audience.  Once again, ma'am, right there.  You're the only woman in that zone.  So stand 
up, and a microphone will come to you.  I mean the only woman raising her hand.  And 
we're actually seeing lots of men raise their hands, and we'd love to hear from some more 
women in fact. 
 
Female Speaker: 
My question is to both teams.  And we talked a lot about how this is in fact a policy 
debate.  And I would like to know what policies, concrete policies, each side would 
propose come out of tonight's discussion. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
Excellent question. 
 
[applause] 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
So part of the argument on our side has been the need for openness.  We believe that the 
most robust cyber security strategy is one that's based on openness and transparency.  
You know something?  That's also been the key to the growth of the internet.  We don't 
think there should be classified documents.  We don't think there should be secret 
standards.  We don't think there should be secret agreements between companies like 
Google and the NSA over how to set cyber security standards for the users of services.  
Just to take that step in this area, we think in the long term would provide great benefit 
for cyber security. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 - 6/8/2010

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
Mike McConnell, who actually helped make policy. 
 
Mike McConnell: 
The nation typically responds to one of four things.  Fortunately, the most important is 
ballots.  And even Marc would agree there's no tampering with those.  The second thing 
is crisis.  There is a crisis, we react, sometimes in a dramatic way. 
 
The third thing is money.  And the fourth thing is law.  What I am arguing, or what I 
propose is we get the law correct.  We don't want to wait for crisis.  And when I made 
reference earlier to the debate in the late '40s and the early '50s, it was achieved in a way 
that I would agree with Marc, openness.  It was an open debate where we put the issues 
on the table, and we talked about it.  And we got to the right place with the right strategy.  
That's when I'm advocating we recognize the vulnerability at a significant level where 
they would be attacked in war that could cause strategic damage to this country so that 
we elevate it and get the right policy embedded in law. 
 
John Donvan: 
Your teammate, Jonathan Zittrain. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
First, let me express complete support and agreement for the fragrant smoke that Marc 
just blew about openness and transparency.  I'm completely in favor of that, too, so if you 
feel supportive of that, it doesn't mean you have to vote for that side because it's about the 
remedy, not about the problem.  But you asked a great question about the remedy and let 
me give you a couple thoughts on that, that I think dovetail with openness and 
transparency.  First, yes to Chris' question from the front row; more money to universities 
and research arms that brought us the Internet to begin with -- that's where the Darpa 
money went, would be great, and more concretely -- I don't know if anybody remembers 
SETI at home?  This was one of these screensavers you could run instead of the flying 
toasters back in the day, and it would be crunching numbers from radio telescopes like 
that movie "Contact," and at some point your computer might be, like, OMG, "We have 
found extraterrestrial life."  
 
[laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Many people installed that and you ended up being able to do what otherwise would take 
a super computer by people volunteering cycles of their computer, offered over the 
network, aid among people with a common goal wanting to serve humanity.  And I 
would love to see essentially what you might call "NATO at home," which is a form of 
mutual aid in alerting, so if your computer is having issues there's a way it can alert 
nearby other computers that can learn to drive around that pothole it just hit. 
 
I'm part of a program called Herdict, as in, verdict of the herd.  I know the name is 
terrible, open to other ideas, but the basic plan is as you're surfing the Net and you find 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

you cannot get there from here for whatever reason, you're trying to get somewhere and 
it's not working, you can click a button and just report that, not even to the government, 
to likeminded people who can then get for the first time exactly the kind of dashboard 
that Mike called for in his editorial so we know where the blocks are.  These are concrete 
ideas in the spirit of mutual aid, and you don't have to -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Jonathan, you’re rather going on.  Thank you.  Bruce Schneier. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
So I actually disagree that openness is not a remedy.  Openness is a remedy.  I mean, one 
of the problems we have in Internet security is secrecy, that when you have secret 
systems, you don't know what the vulnerabilities are, you can't assess them, you can't 
make intelligent buying decisions and use decisions about what to choose.  Openness 
actually is a remedy.  And it is a way to improve security.  The best security protocols we 
have in the Internet have been designed openly either by NIS, by the government, in open 
process, by industry through the IETF, another open process.  Protocols that are 
developed in secret systems in secret tend not to work well.  So basically I view security 
failures on the Internet as market failures; that the incentives aren't aligned for whoever 
has the ability to secure to do it.  And you can see that in identity theft, you can see that 
in viruses, that the people who can solve a problem don't have the incentive to do it.  And 
when you have those problems and you have market failures, government has to step in 
and sort of set those right.  So I actually agree with Mike that the problem is government 
needs to get the policy right.  We probably violently disagree on what that would look 
like, but that's what I want to see.  I want to see the market fails that prevent these 
problems, whether they're the worms, the viruses, and all the servers attacks, the Chinese 
hacking, from happening.  I want to see those fixed. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, I'll go to another question.  I just for no particular reason want to go to a part of the 
room I haven't been to, there's a gentleman -- actually the gentleman who's sitting on the 
stairs, since you've been enduring that position, I think you've earned the right.  Did you 
say come up to the balcony? 
 
Male Speaker: 
I’m on the balcony. 
 
John Donvan: 
Do we have a microphone up there?  We don't.  I apologize.  We don't.  Do you want to 
come down?  If one of you wants to come down, choose a representative -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Male Speaker: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

We really don't need a microphone. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, we do for the broadcast.  If you'd come on down, I promise -- but you're going to ask 
a very good question, right? 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Come on down, seriously, and we'll ask a -- sir, go ahead. 
 
Male Speaker: 
So the proposition that we're being asked to vote on as the audience is that the cyber war 
threat has been grossly exaggerated.  I'd like to know what each of you would say in 
response to the question, how do you measure that threat?  How do you evaluate that 
threat? 
 
John Donvan: 
I think we might -- I'd like to see you rephrase that question that brings us much closer to 
the actual motion, because I think we could chew up a fair amount of time on that.  And I 
actually think we've covered it quite a bit, so I'm going to pass on that question with 
respect. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
That'll be edited out of the broadcast. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no, not necessarily.  Did this gentleman come down yet? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Right here. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sorry? 
 
Male Speaker: 
What I have not gotten from either team, I would like some numbers.  I don't know 
whether or not to be afraid, not afraid -- out of our so-called $14 trillion economy; how 
many of those dollars are currently lost to cyber crime?  I don’t want a solution that is 
more expensive than what we’re trying to fix either in loss of liberty or in terms of actual 
dollars.  How many times have our defensive systems been attacked?  How many of these 
attacks are simply because of sloppy configurations by corporations or the government? 
 
Again, are there any numbers or facts? 
 
John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

Okay, good point, very good point.  Mike McConnell. 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Forty-two. 
 
[laughter and applause] 
 
Mike McConnell: 
I’m not making fun of your question.  There are lots of numbers, millions of attacks and 
so on.  Let me put it in a little context.  I did focus on the financial community because 
that’s one I understand a little bit better.  The financial community in the United States 
spends 500 billion dollars a year on IT, 500 billion dollars a year on information 
technology support.  Now that’s moving all those ones and zeroes that represent your 
money or other company’s money and so on.  So when you talk about expensive 
solutions, at least when I talk to the banking community, they are hungry for a set of 
solutions that allows them to have higher confidence in their transactions.  Now let me 
make my point.  Banking is based on confidence.  We can’t run the globe without it.  So 
when Marc made reference earlier to my suggestion at re-engineering the Internet, I’m all 
for the wild, wild web as most -- as much as anyone wants to be on it but I’m arguing for 
when the transactions impact billions of dollars and millions of peoples -- millions of 
people, you probably should have a level of communicating that is robust and secure.  
Example: the military sends its secrets over the same physical infrastructure as those of 
you in this room that text. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mike, you don’t need to say that.  You made that point before and I think the question 
really was if, you know, if we were, if these attacks were potatoes, how many pounds of 
potatoes do we have racked up already?  Do we know how much damage has been done? 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Well, it’s a hard question to answer.  There are literally billions of attacks.  I can give you 
some numbers like that.  Bruce could give you better numbers than I can, but the point is 
we were in a Cold War and we never exchanged nuclear weapons.  We prevailed. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, to answer his question, we don’t know? 
 
Mike McConnell: 
The answer is there are many ways to answer the question with countless examples. 
 
Terabytes of data have been taken by foreign nation states out of this country that include 
intellectual property for businesses, it includes information from the Department of 
Defense, Department of State, the Congress, the aerospace engineering system, weapons 
designers, huge amounts of --

All right.  Let me go to your opponent, Bruce Schneier. 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
So no debate that the threat of cyber espionage is real and cyber espionage happens every 
day.  The question is about war.  You asked about the losses due to cyber crime.  
Unfortunately I didn’t bring my cyber crime data and they’ve forbidden us to use the 
Internet up here so I can’t get it. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
There are lots of numbers on the net and cyber crime is a very fast growing industry.  I 
would argue if we were up here doing that the threat of cyber crime, we tend to under-
exaggerate.  We know that the federal government spends about $6 billion to $7 billion a 
year, unclassified, on cyber security.  Classified you’d probably want to double that.  
That’s what most people believe but we don’t actually know and they won’t tell us 
because after that they’ll have to kill us. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
Lieutenant General Alexander when he was testifying for head of cyber command said 
the Pentagon networks are targeted by hundreds of thousands of probes per day, whatever 
that means.  You do the numbers, you divide up the number of computers that they have, 
that’s about the same number of probes that you and your corporate network are targeted 
by.  These are mostly automatic worms -- there are ways you can make these numbers 
really sound big.  Amount of data in cyber espionage?  Sure, it’s a lot.  A lot of times we 
don’t know.  A lot of this stuff goes unreported -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me go to Jonathan Zittrain because we came back to we don’t know a lot about it. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Right where Bruce left off, the reason it’s hard to come up with numbers is because even 
the definition of attack varies.  If somebody scans your port, have you been attacked?  A 
computer port not a real life port. 
 
Mike McConnell: 
You don’t even know who it is necessarily. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Exactly, you don’t.  But let me give two statistics that I think are pretty well agreed upon 
that to me frame it nicely. 
 
One is that at this point, there is good confidence that over 99 percent of the e-mail sent 
in the world today is spam. Only one percent or less -- if you dipped into a trough of e-



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

mail circulating, would actually be a letter to somebody with a human on the other end.  
That is pretty crazy.  And network engineers generally say yes.  But three minutes of 
Paris Hilton on a video is so much more bandwidth than all that email, who cares?  Just 
throw it out on the other end.  But it says something about just how far it's been 
penetrated.  Statistic number two, at times, a particular Trojan or virus, a particular piece 
of malware crafted by one entity has been responsible by having infected lots of 
machines that then become spammers for over 50 percent of the spam on a given day.  
And that shows just the extent to which you could have a state change, where one 
particular well-crafted Trojan could have such an impact on the environment.  And that 
gets back to the question about the threat.  I measure the threat by the delta, the difference 
between the day-to-day world we experience right now in cyberspace and the potential, 
the plausible potential, not fake, but the plausible potential for a huge change in the way 
we experience it. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to -- Dan, do he have time for one more question?  Okay, we have time for one 
more.  And, sir, beard, tattoos.  The only one. 
 
Male Speaker: 
So this question is mainly for the folks on the -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Against side? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yeah.  What I wanted to look at here was, the discussion was organizations that are going 
to control the internet you know, focused in the beginning. 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you -- I need you to keep the mic close and also just to get to the point of the 
question, please.  Thanks. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Okay.  Between the FBI, NSA and the red team, it's true that not one organization is 
currently or will be running the internet. 
 
But is this war, or is this focused more like cyber crime?  Because if we look at that, 
looking at Heartland Financial Systems and their penetration, you know, there's similar 
penetrations like Bradley Manning within the DOD where the DOD had -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But really, what is your question? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Do you really, truly feel that this is cyber war, like a cyber war threat and that this isn't 
just cyber crime that happens to be -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
John Donvan: 
Do you mean is it really -- is it really a nation trying to take down our functioning as 
opposed to getting into our bank accounts. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  And are those two things necessarily mutually exclusive.  Mike McConnell. 
 
Mike McConnell: 
It is not cyber war the way you are describing it.  But the proposition is threat of cyber 
war.  So we're talking about the potential threat of cyber war.  And what I'm alleging is 
when there is conflict, even of a kinetic nature between nation states, cyber will be a part 
of a warfare that would be carried out.  What my real worry is are terrorists groups that 
are not deterred, someone who is engaged in the equivalent of suicide bombing, given 
that they could access, penetrate and cause damage to the United States through cyber 
means.  So take us back to the proposition.  It's not war is happening.  It's the threat of 
cyber war being in our future that we must mitigate. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, Marc Rotenberg, last word in this section. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
I just want to restate a point that Bruce made early year, which I think goes directly to 
your question.  If you have a threat of cyber war, you have to believe that there's a threat 
of war.  And you have to believe that one country is prepared to destabilize another 
country, is prepared to see its economy diminish, its trade impacted and whatever 
diplomatic consequences can follow from that.  That's a really big deal. 
 
And in our modern world, it seems increasingly unlikely that countries, even countries 
that don't necessarily get along, are willing to take that risk.  So I think this key point 
about the relationship between the likelihood of cyber war and the likelihood of war can't 
really lose sight of it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Marc Rotenberg.  And that concludes round two of this intelligence squared 
debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And so here's where we are.  We are about to hear brief closing statements from each 
debater.  They will be two minutes each.  And it's their last chance to try to change your 
minds before you vote again on the proposition.  So reminding you of where you all 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

stood when you voted on this proposition, "The cyber war threat has been grossly 
exaggerated" at the beginning of the debate.  At the outset, 24 percent of you agreed with 
the motion.  54 percent disagreed, and 22 percent were undecided.  You will be asked to 
vote once again in just a few minutes, but first; round three, closing statements.  And 
we're going to begin arguing against the motion that the cyber war threat has been grossly 
exaggerated.  Mike McConnell; executive vice president of Booze Allen Hamilton and 
former director of national intelligence and retired vice admiral in the U.S. Navy. 
 
Mike McConnell: 
Bruce made the statement that the problem is secrecy, to which Marc agreed.  And that's 
a very interesting point, but it has nothing to do with this debate.  This debate is not about 
self-serving interests.  It's not about large government programs.  It's not about privacy 
and civil liberties.  This debate is about recognizing the significant vulnerabilities 
resulting from our cyber interconnectedness which results in interdependence.  The 
vulnerability is our interdependence.  When the framers wrote the Constitution, we were 
pretty self-sufficient.  Most of us were farmers, probably in excess of 80, 85 percent.  
Today in this country, 1 percent of the population is engaged in farming. 
 
The 1 percent feed the other 99 percent.  There is huge vulnerability in the fact that you 
are dependent on electric power, digital money, a supermarket full of groceries.  All of 
those things are interdependent and interconnected.  And that's what we're talking about, 
those vulnerabilities.  So if there is a war, if there is a war, cyber attack would be 
mounted.  Now, based on the positions I've occupied inside and outside of government, I 
can assure you that nation states are preparing for cyber war.  Marc said they may be 
preparing, but they would be unwilling to use it.  You could describe that as deterrence.  I 
support deterrence.  That's what this debate is all about.  What is it we have to do to be 
able to deter other nation states from engaging in war or engaging in cyber war?  I urge 
you to support our position on this debate and vote against -- against the proposition. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mike McConnell. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Our motion is the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated.  And here to offer his 
summarizing statements for the motion; Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center and adjunct professor at Georgetown University 
Law Center. 
 
Marc Rotenberg: 
Okay.  So we've tried to persuade you this evening that this threat of cyber war, key term, 
has been grossly exaggerated.  And I wanted to say that Mike McConnell and I have 
debated these issues for many years.  And I suspect we will continue to debate them on 
into the future because we know, on both sides, that there are consequences that flow 
from how you judge the proposition tonight, whether the military plays a greater role in 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

cyber security, whether internet users are required to identify themselves, whether 
government agencies are allowed to conduct routine surveillance of communications 
within the United States. 
 
All of those consequences are on the table, depending on what you conclude regarding 
our debate.  But there's something about the debate tonight which actually surprises me a 
little bit.  And that's the fact that Jonathan Zittrain is sitting at that table and not our table.  
And the reason I make this argument is because Jonathan has written very persuasively 
about the generativity nature of the open internet.  And he has educated us about the 
value of the decentralized distributed model that has made possible companies like E-bay 
and Google and services like Wikipedia, and on the story goes.  Jonathan, I can promise 
you that none of this would have ever happened if the NSA had won the clipper chip 
debate back in the 1990s.  And I'm going to urge you, along with the rest of you, to come 
over to our side.  I'll get a chair for you here.  We've got a couple chairs, don't we?  We'd 
love to have you on our side because if you value an open internet, if you believe that 
innovation and security, just like innovation and commerce, is based on the open 
competition of ideas, then you have to support our side.  You have to support the pro 
position in this debate. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Marc Rotenberg. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, as it happens, summarizing -- up next to summarize his view against the motion, 
the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated, Jonathan Zittrain, professor at Harvard 
law school and cofounder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Marc, let me thank you for your kind and genuine offer of asylum over on your side of 
the room. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
Let me tell you why I think instead, both of you guys should be coming over here where 
the air is clear, and the thinking is equally clear -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
-- and where your fears can still be realized over here. 
 
You don't have to give up what you're afraid of to come over to this side because I was 
surprised, too, because what surprised me tonight was that if there's going to be scare 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

mongering on some side you would think it would be on the people saying no, no, the 
threat isn't exaggerated, here's why you need to be afraid, be very afraid.  But the fear 
machine I felt was generated over here because what they were talking about were the 
worries about the remedy, if we come in and take something that they think isn't all that 
broke and try to fix it we're going to end up with surveillance we don't want, with a police 
state, with a military state, et cetera, et cetera.  Now, in some respects I share that fear of 
overreaction should we get a watershed event, and that's why I think we need to be so 
gimlet-eyed about plausible possibilities that make things different than they are right 
now.  I know the chicken wakes up every day, the free-range chicken, and says, oh, the 
farmer has come along to feed me again.  Life is good. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
But sometimes induction doesn't work just from the fact that the farmer's been friendly 
every day. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
So I worry that we'll get an event of some kind and then Bruce and Marc's nightmares 
will come true because we will end up in a Cold War mentality, a conventional war 
mentality, about how to deal with it, and that is the wrong mentality, and that's why I 
stand by my previous writings, Marc, and that's why when you asked for concrete 
suggestions they're suggestions that rely on openness, on transparency, on goodwill and 
cooperation among people metaphorically passing the microphone from one to another 
like an ad hoc mesh network.  Creatively we can do this. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jonathan Zittrain, your time is up. 
 
Jonathan Zittrain: 
And I thank you all. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Our motion is "The Cyber War Threat Has Been Grossly Exaggerated," and now, making 
his summary statement summarizing his position for the motion, Bruce Schneier, chief 
security technology officer of BT and author of "The Cryptogram" newsletter and blog, 
"Schneier on Security." 
 
Bruce Schneier: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - 6/8/2010 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 
  Arlington, VA 22203 

So we spent a lot of time on semantics here.  I'm going to again read this from the 
Washington Post, Mike McConnell said, "The United States is fighting a cyber war today 
and we are losing."  This is a position that exaggerates the threat.  It's a valuable one, 
$300 million in contracts of Booz Allen this year, and -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Bruce Schneier: 
-- it's one we see again and again.  This is not a few things, cyber war, cyber 9/11, cyber 
Pearl Harbor, cyber Katrina, cyber Armageddon -- every one of these words gets to be 
the millions or 100,000s of hits on Google.  This is not just a few headline writers making 
a big deal.  I mean, yes, the word "war" has flipped.  We don't want to use it when we're 
actually at war, and we use it all the time when we're at rhetorical war.  And this might 
seem like a petty semantic argument, but actually this matters a lot.  All right, words 
matter a lot.  Words have power.  Words frame debate.  Words suggest solutions.  And 
words cause policy to be implemented.  We are not just discussing whether the threat of 
cyber war has been grossly exaggerated, we are discussing how we are going to deal with 
Internet threats.  This debate has ranged all around.  We've heard about espionage.  We've 
heard about terrorism.  We've heard about crime.  We've heard about kids playing 
politics, and it's all here on a panel on cyber war.  So when you think about this I urge 
you to vote that the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated, it's been grossly 
exaggerated by government and industry intent on grabbing power and money.  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Bruce Schneier, and that concludes our closing statements. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And it's now time to learn which side has argued best in the judgment of our live 
audience.  We are asking you again to go to the keypads at your seat to register your vote 
on this motion, "The Cyber War Threat Has Been Grossly Exaggerated."  If you agree 
with this motion, if you are with the "for" side, press number one, if you disagree, push 
number two, and if you remain undecided or became undecided, push number three. 
 
And we'll have -- looks like everybody's done -- we will have the results in just a couple 
of minutes.  I want to -- first of all, what I really want to do is thank this panel that has 
been just spectacular, informative, as well as entertaining. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Really.

John Donvan: 
And I think -- Robert Rozenkranz, I think Washington, D.C. was a good idea, this 
audience has been terrific and we want you to really applaud yourself, you were very 
lively, terrific questions, so thank you for that. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
So I’d like to also thank our venue, the Newseum, and our partners, NPR, WAMU, 
Bloomberg Television and Newsweek and, of course, a very special thanks go to CEO, 
Jeff Ganek from tonight’s corporate underwriter, Neustar.  Thank you, Jeff, very much 
for doing this. 
 
[applause] 
 
As was already said a number of times, this is the first time we’ve taken the program 
outside of New York City and without Neustar’s support, it just wouldn’t have happened 
so we hope this is not the last time that happens.  We’ll be back, Jeff. [laughs] 
 
Male Speaker: 
Thanks to our moderator. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, thank you so much.  We’re going to be back in New York City beginning our next 
season on September 14th and the season will kick off with Michael Hayden arguing for 
the motion which is “Treat terrorists like enemy combatants not criminals.”  This fall will 
also include debates on same-sex marriage, banking reform, atheism and airport profiling.

I want to thank all the people who asked the questions.  I also want to thank the 
gentleman whose question I did not take for being gracious in giving up the microphone, 
and for you up in the balcony for making your presence known and coming down here.  
So I think I heard a door opening in the back and there’s supposed to be somebody 
running forward in an excited manner with a piece of paper that I will unfold but Dana, 
do you have information on how close this is?  Here she comes now.  
 
Bruce Schneier: 
If you have to stall I think Mike and I can switch sides for 10 minutes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah.  I think that happened already.  So we have the final results in.  Our motion is the 
cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated.  Remember, the team that changes the 
most minds is our winner.  Before the debate, 24 percent were for the motion, 54 percent 
against, 22 percent undecided.  After the debate, 23 percent are for the motion, 71 percent 
are against and six percent undecided.  Against the motion wins.  Congratulations to 
them.  Thank you from me, John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S.
