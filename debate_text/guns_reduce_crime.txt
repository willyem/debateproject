JOHN DONVAN 

At the moment, our debaters are coming down toward the stage 

so I just wanna ask you for a round of applause for all of them.  

[APPLAUSE]  And may I introduce the founder and CEO of 

Intelligence Squared US, Robert Rosenkranz.   

[APPLAUSE]   

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Well, we’re nothing if not timely, uh, there was an eight-column 

headline in today’s New York Times.  Quote, “Two gunmen kill 

man, 19, and wound four people in a Brooklyn hair salon.”  We 

all remember the headlines around the Virginia massacre.  It’s 

not headline news, but some 17,000 suicides are committed with 

guns every year in America.   So gun control has a very powerful 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 2. 

 

 

 

emotional appeal.  And in New York you can sort of have the idea 

that only gun nuts are opposed to control.  So what is the debate 

about tonight?  Where is the case for guns reducing crime?   It 

really lies in two ideas, it’s the idea that guns can prevent crimes, 

if people have guns at home or in their cars they can prevent 

crimes by firing a warning shot, by simply announcing I’ve got a 

gun, and those are very undramatic incidents, they’re not 

reported in the newspapers.  But, they’re real and they happen 

every day.  Crimes can be deterred by the prevalence of guns.  In 

the United States it’s very unusual for robbers to come into 

homes that are occupied.  In Britain it’s much more common.  

And the reason is that guns in the home can act as a real 

deterrent.  In another context of course there’s a Constitutional 

right to bear arms.   And that’s not just a sort of historic 

anomaly.  It really reflects a basic, natural law, idea of self-

defense.  And people who have taken the trouble to train 

themselves and to use guns properly in their self-defense, this is 

a very, very important right for them and something that they 

hold onto with a great deal of emotional force as well.   But, 

tonight we’re trying to transcend emotion, we’re really trying to 

see whether gun control keeps guns away from criminals, or 

whether it allows the criminals to have a monopoly of gun power.  

Whether the preventive effects and the deterrent effects of guns 

in the hands of a law-abiding populace actually make us safer.

Or, are the costs involved in these gun accidents and rampages 

and suicides that we all see in the headlines, is that the 

dominant factor in our thinking about gun policy.   So with that 

kind of framing of the debate I’m really happy to hand the 

evening over to John Donvan, our moderator from ABC News, 

and the terrific panel that we’ve assembled tonight.  Thank you 

for being here.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, and I would just like to invite one more round of 

applause for Robert Rosenkranz who makes all of this possible 

for us.  [APPLAUSE]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to 

Intelligence Squared US, Oxford-style debating brought to 

America’s shores.  I’m John Donvan of “ABC News Nightline.”   

On this stage tonight as your host and more importantly your 

moderator for another in our series of smart and sparkling 

debates on topics that matter.  The motion before us in this 

program here at the Caspary Auditorium of the Rockefeller 

University in New York—the motion before us, “Guns reduce 

crime.”  Which may sound counterintuitive, but that actually 

depends on how this debate goes, and it may actually sound 

intuitive, again depending on how the debate goes.   We are 

joined also on this stage by two teams of debaters, of three 

members each, each of them superbly qualified to be taking part 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 4. 

 

 

 

in this discussion.  You are also a part of the evening, in that this 

is a contest, it is a contest of persuasion.   These debaters are 

here to influence your views, to try to change your minds if you 

disagree with their position.  It is a contest of logic and wit and 

charm and humor but mostly it is a contest of the power of ideas.  

In order to gauge and include your participation, we are going to 

poll you twice during the evening, once in a moment, and once at 

the end of the debate, in order to see where you stand on this 

motion that guns reduce crime.   So at this point, we would like 

each of you to turn to the number pads at your seats, and 

indicate your agreement, disagreement, or lack of decision, over 

this proposition, the proposition before us that guns reduce 

crime.   While you’re doing that I wanna point out the shape of 

the evening.  Each of the debaters will have opening statements.  

Those statements will last seven minutes and it will be timed by 

us in this way— at the one-minute mark, when they have spoken 

six minutes and have seven minutes—one minute to go, they will 

hear a tone, a warning tone that sounds like this.  [PAUSE, 

LAUGHTER]   That means they can talk and talk and talk.  

[PAUSE]  It—  [WARNING TONE]  Did you all hear that?  Clearly?  

At the seven-minute mark when time is up, the same tone will 

sound except it will be more persistent, more like this.  

[REPEATING WARNING TONE]   And it will continue to do that 

until the speaker— stops—talking.  [LAUGHTER, PAUSE]  After 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 5. 

 

 

 

the opening round, our second round will be a head-to-head 

debate in which the debaters will debate among themselves, and 

also will take questions from me and questions from you, the 

audience.   I encourage you to be critical in the way you listen, 

and critical in the way you ask questions, because once again, 

you are the judges of this evening, you will decide the winners of 

this debate.  And then at the end of the debate once again we will 

poll you to see where we stand on the numbers.   There will be a 

two-minute summary statement by each debater to wrap up the 

event and at that point we will announce the winners based on 

your judgment.  So with that said, let the debate begin.  Only 

rarely does a man of ideas witness in his own lifetime, the 

opportunity to actually see one of his ideas change history.   For 

a scholar who wrote a controversial book in the 1990s, arguing 

that, where there is more gun ownership there is actually less 

crime, that history-making experience took place.  Legislatures 

across the country took hold of the ideas in that book, and 

passed laws allowing for the carrying of concealed weapons, that 

indeed was history-making.   The author of that idea and of the 

book that contained those ideas, is our first debater tonight, 

speaking for the motion, “Guns reduce crime,” John Lott.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN LOTT 

Well, thank you very much, I appreciate Mr. Rosenkranz putting

this on and it’s an honor to be invited here and the introduction 

was overly generous.  But guns cause bad things to happen and 

makes—and guns make it easier for bad things to happen.   But 

guns also make it easier for people to protect themselves and 

prevent bad things from happening.  Guns make it easier for you 

to harm somebody, but guns also make it easier for you to deter 

criminals from attacking to begin with, and turn out to be the 

most effective way for somebody to go and defend themselves 

when they’re having to face a criminal by themselves.  It’d be 

great if police were there all the time, my research finds that 

police are probably the single most important factor for reducing 

crime.   But I think one thing the police understand themselves is 

they virtually always arrive on the crime scenes after the crime’s 

occurred.  And the question you have to ask is what do you 

advise someone having to do, when they’re having to confront a 

criminal by themselves?   Even if they’re able to call 911, you 

know, fast response times are measured in eight or nine or 10 

minutes.  And that can be a lifetime for many people.  I think, as 

Mr. Rosenkranz was mentioning to begin with, a lot of people 

have a pretty good idea of the bad things that happen with guns.   

He mentioned the number of suicides.  But you also have, if you 

look at surveys done by the Justice Department you’ll find maybe 

about 400-450,000 crimes are committed each year with guns.  

By contrast, you have similar types of surveys that indicate that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 7. 

 

 

 

people use guns defensively about 2 million times a year.   So 

about four to five times more frequently people use guns to stop 

crimes than guns are used in the commission of crime.  And yet, 

I assume for exactly the reasons why Mr. Rosenkranz mentioned 

earlier, people are if anything like to guess the opposite.   I mean 

if you have—if you’re the editor of a newspaper and you have two 

crimes that you’re talking about, one, there’s a dead body on the 

ground, sympathetic person like a victim, and another case 

where a woman’s brandished a gun, the would-be criminals run 

away, no shots are fired, no dead body on the ground, it’s pretty 

obvious which story’s gonna be considered much more 

newsworthy.   Now, we all want to try to take guns away from 

criminals.  I mean one thing that’s been tried many times is to go 

and have gun bans.  The problem is that when you go and pass 

something like that, the question you have to ask yourself many 

times is who’s most likely to obey the rule.   If it turns out that 

it’s the most law-abiding citizens who obey the rule and turn in 

their guns, relative to the criminals, you can actually see 

increases in violent crime.  And Washington D.C. is one 

important example of that.  In 1976, September of ’76, D.C. 

passed a ban banning handguns, it didn’t go into effect until 

February, uh, ’77.  Uh, but only once after ’76 was D.C.’s murder 

rate as low as it was in ’76.  Only twice in two years after that 

was D.C.’s robbery rate as low as it was in ’76.   And D.C.’s crime 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 8. 

 

 

 

rate not only went up relative to what it was in the past, D.C.’s 

crime rate went up relative to neighboring states, it went up 

compared to the United States as a whole, it went up relative to 

other large cities.   Here’s a graph that shows you for the top 50 

cities of the United States, in 1976, D.C. was about 18 

percentage points higher than the other 49 cities in the top 50.  

You can see after that, it keeps on going up, and if I were to have 

it in ’88, it even soars dramatically past that,  but you can see, 

it’s about 90 percent higher when you get to 1987, the rate was 

falling before the ban, relative to other cities and rising 

dramatically afterward.  It’s not just D.C. though.  In Chicago, 

Chicago’s murder and robbery rates were falling prior to the 1982 

ban, and they rose afterwards, they rose relative to other cities.   

One other way I can just mention for D.C. here, D.C. was 15th of 

the top…50 cities prior to the ban.  In half the years after the 

ban, it was either number one or number two, and it was number 

four another four years, so two-thirds of the time after the ban, it 

was one of the top four cities.   It was nowhere even close to that 

prior to the ban going into effect.  It’s just not in the United 

States.  Worldwide, time after time—and it’d be interesting to 

have people try to show an example where this isn’t true—when 

you pass bans you see increases in violent crime rates.  The UK, 

here’s an illustration from The Economist a few years ago.  They’d 

banned handguns in January ’97.  Robbery rates, armed robbery 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 9. 

 

 

 

rates were falling up until the time the ban went into effect, and 

they rose afterwards, if you’d continue this graph they’d continue 

to go up.  You’ve had a 340 percent increase since the ban went 

into effect and the rate at which people are harmed by guns.   

You look at Ireland, Jamaica—  I mean one thing is, people go 

and say well the reason why the Chicago and D.C. bans didn’t 

work is because it’s so easy to go and get access to guns in other 

places.  Well here you have ideal situations, you have island 

nations, where it’s relatively easy and go and enforce the borders 

and protect them.   And yet they’ve seen huge increases in the 

numbers of illegal guns, because essentially all of them are illegal 

after these bans go into effect.  And yet just as we see here in the 

UK if you look at Ireland or Jamaica or other places, you see time 

after time increases in robbery and murder rates and violent 

crimes.   Now one thing people often do is they look across 

countries and they say well, look, England has a relatively low 

gun ownership rate, it has a relatively high murder rate even if 

their violent crime rate is twice what we are in the United States.   

And they may point to Japan or Germany or other countries, and 

they say the United States has more guns, more violent crime.  

But the thing they have to take into account is these other 

countries had much, much lower violent crime rates prior to bans 

going into effect.   In 1900 for example in England, in London, a 

city of millions of people, [WARNING TONE] with no gun 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 10. 

 

 

 

regulations, you had two gun murders, and five armed gun 

robberies that took place.  And, what you see time after time 

when these bans go into effect, either violent crime rates no 

longer drop, or they begin to start to go up, as you’ve seen in 

England and other countries.  Probably one of the most 

controversial things we could talk about are gun-free zones that 

we have in the United States for things like schools or other 

places.   And we hear about these things, they, they dominate the 

news.  But yet one fact doesn’t go out, you cannot find one of 

these multiple-victim shootings in the United States that occur, 

that takes place in—where more than three people are killed, that 

doesn’t take place in a gun-free zone where civilians are banned 

from owning guns.  You want to make places safer.  Banning 

guns you think are the easy solution to that.  But again if you 

pass a ban and it’s the law-abiding good citizens who obey the 

ban and not the criminals, rather than making it safe for the 

would-be victims [REPEATING WARNING TONE] you may 

unintentionally make it safe for the criminals who are intent on 

trying to harm others and make less for them to worry about, 

thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, John Lott.  One of the safest major cities in the 

United States is Seattle, thanks in great measure to the work

done by its police force, under the leadership of a chief who has 

led the city to a 40-year low in violence.  That said, problems 

persist there as everywhere else, especially among young 

offenders, a point brought home to the Chief of Police in Seattle, 

after, in an anecdote he shared with us, he was doing some after-

Christmas day shopping at a mall and when he returned to his 

car it had been broken into, and the one item stolen from his car 

was his gun.   It’s firsthand experience, and, certainly of everyone 

on our panel, no one has more actual firsthand experience 

dealing with guns and crime than the Chief of Police of Seattle, 

Gil Kerlikowske.    

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

Thank you, John, thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Well, it’s a pleasure 

to be here with you, I was worried that they wouldn’t bring that 

story out and I wanted to make sure that I did full disclosure 

and… ‘course I also appreciate the Seattle-like weather during 

the last couple days.  [LAUGHTER]  Let me give you a perspective 

from a police chief’s point of view.  First of all you have to 

understand that the position of police chief is not, whether it’s 

Ray Kelly, the great police commissioner in New York City, myself 

or others, we all actually worked our way up through the ranks.   

A puff of white smoke didn’t emanate from City Hall and 

suddenly we became anointed with these positions.  All of us 

worked as police officers and detectives and sergeants, et cetera, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 12. 

 

 

 

so we kind of understand some of the nitty-gritty, although the 

television shows here in New York are so much better.  

[LAUGHTER]   The right to—in Seattle we’d have latte stories or 

something.  But the right to own and possess a gun in this 

country isn’t a debatable issue and it’s not the topic. 

Reasonableness though, and common sense do come into play.   

I’m not a researcher and I am certainly not going to play a 

researcher for this debate tonight, but I do want to cite a couple 

things because it provides a framework for you, but it also puts 

into my perspective 36 years of law enforcement experience.   

This is work done by Phil Cook.  So the rates of assault, robbery 

and rape will not noticeably be affected by more guns.  Increase 

in the secondary market of guns, will occur.  What is it in the 

secondary market?  Loans to and from family members of 

firearms, off-the-book sales, meaning that there was no 

background check.   Thefts of guns which, it was mentioned, I 

am personally familiar with.  The percent of suicide with guns is 

highly correlated with the prevalence of gun ownership, and the 

murder rate in large counties is closely linked to gun prevalence.  

An increase in the gun murder rate would be expected, but there 

was no effect on the non-gun murder rate.   So you’re going hear 

from the other side about the deterrence effect, and in fact John 

already brought a little bit about that up.  More people carrying 

more guns will deter criminals.  In other words the criminals will 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 13. 

 

 

 

think twice before confronting a potential victim.   I wish 

criminals were that smart.  On the other hand I’m glad that 

they’re not that smart, because that’s why we catch so many of 

them all the time.  Since we have almost, in the neighborhood of 

240 million guns in the United States, I would think that these 

criminals would already get the message that there are a lot of 

guns out there and that if deterrence was in fact carried through 

that we would’ve seen it by now, but we haven’t.   The other side 

of this coin is, will more armed citizens have an opposite effect on 

criminals.  In other words, are the criminals going to now arm 

themselves thinking that more and more and more people are 

carrying guns.   Well, the union that represents the British 

bobbies, who have been unarmed since Sir Robert Peel founded 

them, their union went forward and said look, we do not want to 

be armed as bobbies in the UK.  Now this was during a time of 

significant increases in crime, increases in knife crime which is 

still going on.  But they asked not to be armed.  Now there are 

some specialized units certainly, called armed response cars, et 

cetera.  But for the vast majority of the bobbies in all of the UK 

they are not armed and they don’t want to be because, one, they 

think it will only increase assaults on themselves, and that it will 

be a tit-for-tat or a proliferation of guns in the UK.  Which like 

rabies they have very few of.   Who is carrying a gun now in this 

country in the United States, well of course law enforcement 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

officers, state, federal, local.  And, security guards, security 

guards across all walks of life from banks to armored-car 

services, literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people 

that are already carrying guns.   And then there’s a whole ‘nother 

group of people, and those are the people that are able to go into 

their states, and ask for a concealed firearms permit.  There is a 

background check, it depends on the state, on what’s done.   But 

essentially they say look, I sell jewelry or I have a business that’s 

been robbed, or, you know what, I want to be able to carry a gun 

like in Florida.  And they’ll be able to carry a firearm as a 

concealed firearm.  Here’s the big unknown, here’s where 

research has not actually answered this question.   All of these 

hundreds of thousands of cops out there and security guards and 

citizens who have concealed firearms permits, how many are 

actually carrying a gun?  They may have the permits, they may 

have the authority.  When you’re a new police officer, you’re 

usually armed to the teeth, and within a few days or months or 

years or whatever, you oftentimes don’t carry a gun.  It used to be 

that you were required in police departments across the country 

to be armed whenever you were out and about, off-duty or on.   

Very few departments have those rules anymore.  Because the 

gun is difficult to conceal, it is uncomfortable and it is difficult to 

secure.  So when we think of all the people that are actually out 

there, how many are actually armed.  We don’t know.   Now 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 15. 

 

 

 

whenever somebody gives you a simple solution to a complex 

problem, we all know that you can be assured of one thing, it’s 

wrong.  And so after all of the different campus shootings that we 

have talked about and read about, just recently of course in 

Arkansas, we hear this hue and cry, well, the students should be 

armed, or the students and the faculty should be armed.  And 

the outcome as one academic told me, there is one sure outcome 

of arming the college students [WARNING TONE] and that would 

be grade inflation.  [LAUGHTER]  The last thing that I’ll 

mention—let me close with this.  When I was a young officer, 

working the street in St. Petersburg--retired people, a lot of them 

from New York in fact-- a young woman, 15 years old, 

intoxicated, beating and beating and beating on the front door of 

an elderly couple who had no phone.   They became more and 

more and more afraid, but she had been there beating on the 

door.  He turned to the thing that he felt could protect him the 

most, even though she was unable of course to get in, and she 

was just really an intoxicated kid beating on the front door.   He 

fired through the door and struck her.  A girl about the age that 

his granddaughter could or would have been.  And I remember 

going to the hospital and seeing her there, and I remember the 

family that lived, that husband and wife in St. Petersburg for 

many, many years.  There are lots of cases in which these guns 

could protect you, [REPEATING WARNING TONE] there are far 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

more cases in which the gun does not.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Gil Kerlikowske, arguing against the motion.  Not 

many lawyers get to argue before the Supreme Court ever in their 

careers, much less get to bat .1000 when they do so.  As a lawyer 

representing the National Rifle Association, Stephen Halbrook 

has gone 3-for-3 before the Supreme Court in arguing firearms 

cases on behalf of the NRA.  He is on our stage tonight to argue 

in this debate for the motion, “Guns reduce crime.”  Stephen?   

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

Thank you, John.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  It’s a real pleasure 

to be here, I think one of the remarks that Gil just made, shows 

the difference between our country and England, historically, not 

just today.  Our country was founded when the British 

government had a policy of colonialism in which it sought to 

exploit the Americans, to tax them without representation, and 

when the Americans protested there was an escalation, and the 

British sought to disarm the Americans that led to violence, 

because the Americans thought this is our only chance to protect 

ourselves.  When you look at a debate topic like this, “Guns 

reduce crime,” for and against, let’s define our terms a little bit, 

guns possessed by who.   Guns possessed by law-abiding citizens 

reduce crime but not guns possessed by criminals, and, what 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 17. 

 

 

 

does crime mean, we look at the term crime I think in a—we 

should look at it in a very broad way.  Crime means the unjust 

aggression against life, liberty, and property, of another person.   

So crime can be committed...singly by one person against 

another or, in small groups by a gang of criminals against 

another.  Or at the highest level it can be committed by 

governments.  When we look at the problem of genocide, the 

problem of crimes against humanity, these are major crimes 

involving large populations frequently in which guns are used 

unjustly and there’s an ability to do that on behalf of 

authoritarian or police states because the population is 

disarmed.   So, when we look at this issue we should look at not 

just here and now,  what happens in the United States, or what’s 

happened in the last decade or two, or what happens today, but 

look at it historically in terms of what sorts of societies have 

existed historically and which ones have balance and democracy 

and republicanism and which ones are the kinds of states that 

you don’t wanna live in, Nazi Germany, Uganda under Idi Amin 

or Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, I mean—this is real.  We 

live in a society that’s very nice right now, it’s not guaranteed 

that it’ll always be that way, either, in terms of your own personal 

life or in terms of the possibility that a government could turn 

bad.   What I think we’re advocating tonight, those of us on the 

side of the proposition, is that you should have freedom of choice 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 18. 

 

 

 

to protect yourself if you decide to do that.  One of the questions 

that was asked recently in the US Supreme Court,  the District of 

Columbia was trying to defend its handgun ban and they said 

that it’s okay to ban handguns and that all guns should have 

trigger locks and be disassembled and never loaded.  And one of 

the Supreme Court justices asked the question, well what if you 

hear the door crash in and you’re fumbling for your reading 

glasses and trying to turn on the lamp and your hands are 

trembling…maybe it would be a good idea to have a gun available 

if something like that happened so, the question is not whether 

everybody should have a gun, but the question is should you 

have the ability to exercise that freedom of choice if you are a 

responsible citizen, and that’s your decision to do so.  Our 

American Revolution proved the ability of an armed populace 

basically to defeat a tyranny and that’s why we ended up in our 

Bill of Rights with the right of the people to keep and bear arms, 

the declaration that it shall not be infringed, and also a 

declaration in favor of a militia because that enhanced the 

security of a free state, security means that a free state is 

preserved as a viable political entity, it has republican 

institutions and people themselves are able to dissuade tyranny, 

they’re able to fight individual criminals.  It was always 

considered to be a responsibility of individuals to, in the ancient 

hue and cry and the watch and ward, to, if criminals were on the

loose, to try to catch them.  And now we have degenerated 

somewhat into a society, where you don’t help anybody, and we 

have many instances where criminals are attacking people and 

nobody basically gives a damn.   So…basically it comes back to 

freedom of choice, I’d like to use a couple of maybe legal cases, to 

illustrate the point.  You’ve heard D.C. became the murder 

capitol of the United States after it enacted a handgun ban.  

There’s no duty of the police to protect you, it’s not just 

impossible for them to do so, it’s not a legal duty.  Right before 

the handgun ban in D.C. was enacted, there were three women 

who were in a boarding house, and they were broken into.  And 

there were two individuals who, over a period of many, many 

hours, raped and robbed and otherwise assaulted them.  They 

called 911 several times, and the police would come knock on the 

door and nobody would respond.  The police would drive by the 

house, because these ladies made repeated calls to 911.  And so 

this ordeal, this nightmare finally ended, and they sued the DC 

government.  And the courts ruled that there is no duty of 

government to protect any individual person.  They have a duty 

to society at large, which is just kind of a useless concept when 

you're an individual and you're a crime victim.  So there’s no duty 

to protect you.  And then the question becomes, well, maybe you 

would like to protect yourself.  Maybe you would like to at least 

have the legal right to do that.  And that’s what the second

amendment is partly intended to guarantee.  That’s what the 

Supreme Court just held in DC versus Heller that we do have an 

individual right to keep and bear arms.  And it’s a right.  It’s not 

something you have to do.  It’s not a duty.  But it’s something 

that you can do.  I represented a group of litigants in a 

companion case, and they live in the ghetto in DC, they're victims 

of robberies, house break-ins.  This happened repeatedly.  And 

they were good citizens, and they simply wanted access to guns.  

The same thing could be illustrated in Hurricane Katrina where 

the police chief announced no law abiding citizen could have 

guns, and basically they, the police themselves disarmed 

individual citizens.  And we see the result of that.  But if you 

went across the river into Algiers, the community known as 

Algiers, citizens armed themselves, they provided their own arms, 

and they kept violence down, they kept looting down.  The same 

thing happened in the LA riots, and the same thing happened in 

Hurricane Andrew in Florida.  There was no police protection, no 

national guard protection for several days.  Armed citizens came 

forward and basically made sure that there was no looting, and 

no robberies, and no murders proceeding.  So, the bottom line is, 

we don’t have the same system as England.  You didn't hear Gil 

announce that the Seattle police force should disarm themselves.  

To the contrary, we should have armed police forces, and we 

should have that right to be exercised by individual citizens.

Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Stephen Halbrook.  We are halfway through our 

opening section of opening statements.  And for people who may 

just be joining the radio broadcast, or who came in late, I'm going 

to say the following.  I'm John Donvan of ABC News, and this is 

Intelligence Squared US, Oxford style debating brought to 

American shores.  We have six panelists on the stage, three for, 

and three against the motion “Guns Reduce Crime.”  We are 

halfway through our opening statements, and now let’s let the 

debate continue.  We are all wise enough in the ways of the world 

to know that the statement “statistics never lie” is a lie.  The 

point being that honest scholars can look at the same numbers 

and disagree profoundly about what they mean.  We heard from 

John Lott, whose specialty is looking at the statistics of gun 

crime.  We are now going to be hearing from John Donohue, who 

is also a numbers man, but who looks at the numbers and comes 

up with dramatically different points of view on guns and crime.  

And through the academic journals, the two John’s have 

something of a feud going.  If you want to look up the journals-- 

some of which we may touch on tonight.  But introducing you, as 

our next speaker, against the motion “Guns Reduce Crime,” John 

Donohue.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 22. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONOHUE 

Thank you very much, it’s a great pleasure to be with you 

tonight.  Well you mention a feud, I am a peaceful man, but let 

me just say that everything that you’ve heard from John in terms 

of the statistical claims are subject to serious challenge and 

refutation.  Quickly, on the DC handgun ban issue, keep in mind 

that it was a DC handgun ban.  You could still have a shotgun in 

your home.  So if you needed to be protected in your home…  The 

only thing that they were trying to take away was handguns, 

because those are the guns most preferred by criminals.  But, if 

you look at the numbers that John had put up, which was 

interesting, if he had actually showed you the number of murders 

in DC, they had actually dropped.  He showed you the rate.  And 

what was interesting about that was, DC was de-populating 

tremendously in the seventies, and it was largely the flight of the 

affluent.  So, the group that had the lowest likelihood of engaging 

in crime.  So, crime was going to be, if you used the rates that 

John showed, it was going to be trending up, because the people 

remaining in the city had a much, much higher risk of crime.  

And so, when you make those adjustments, the conclusions are 

opposite to what John suggested.  If you went for a number of 

years you’d see there was a huge run up in crime in DC, as there 

was in Chicago, and Philadelphia, and New York for that matter.  

But it had nothing to do with the topic we’re talking about.  That 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 23. 

 

 

 

was crack cocaine, which had a tremendous criminogenic 

influence on crime.  The final thing to mention about DC 

handgun ban, is whatever it says about that particular 

experience, remember, DC is right across from Virginia, where 

there are plenty of guns.  So, the story that John tries to tell you 

may tell you something about gun control in that urban 

environment, but it’s not a story about the value of guns.  

Everyone concedes that guns in the hands of the right person at 

the right time can reduce crime.  That's why, as we heard, armed 

police and security guards are a good thing.  If you go to a 

maximum security prison, the prison guards don’t have guns, 

because there are times when guns are good, and there are times 

when guns are bad.  Prison guards, you might think, would want 

to have guns, but they know those guns would be taken away in 

a heartbeat by the criminals who are behind bars, so therefore 

you don’t see it.  If you could expand the population in a cautious 

way to those who are unquestionably law abiding, and a cautious 

population, sure, there can be benefits there.  But, the idea that,  

John Lott, and you will hear Gary Kleck argue that guns are 

being used constantly to thwart, um, criminals by these gun-

toting citizens is grotesquely misleading.  John gave a number, 

two million.  Gary Kleck has at times said there are two point five 

million defensive uses of handguns each year.  It’s a complete 

fantasy because gun ownership is so prevalent in this country, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 24. 

 

 

 

criminals know that all they have to do is wait for the family to 

leave and go to work, or to school, and then they can just walk in 

and grab the guns.  And that happens five hundred thousand to 

a million times per year. So by virtue of our prevalence of guns, 

we are giving great aid and comfort to the criminal population, 

because they can walk in, take those guns.  There was a 

wonderful Sixty Minutes documentary a number of years ago 

designed to show you how you could protect your house from a 

burglar.  And they had an active burglar showing how quickly he 

could get in the house.  And when he got in, Mike Wallace asked 

him, well, what’s the first thing you do when you get in the 

house?  And he said, look for the guns.  They're gold to criminals, 

and that’s why they go in and get them. [00:39:44:2]  So, 

whatever benefit we get from scaring off, or even shooting a small 

number of criminals, it’s offset by the fact that five times as many 

guns will be handed over to a criminal, in effect, because the 

criminals will be taking that gun from the previously law-abiding 

citizen.  Now, John and I have debated on the issue of right to 

carry laws, laws that say citizens who have not yet been 

convicted of a felony, or not yet been involuntarily committed to a 

mental hospital should be allowed to carry a gun wherever they 

want.  John thinks this is a great idea, offers statistics to prove it.  

Let me just mention that in Texas, even if you have been 

committed to a mental hospital, if you can get a note from your

doctor, they’ll give you that concealed handgun permit.  North 

Dakota really set a new low.  They actually gave one of these 

permits to a blind permit holder.  This is, to be frank, insanity.  

Now, I published a number of econometric studies, and virtually 

every top econometrician who has looked at this has sided with 

me, and not with John Lott.  The National Academy of Sciences 

convened a panel of talented experts who spent two years looking 

at John Lott’s work, Gary Kleck’s work.  They came before the 

committee, testified, fifteen to one in that panel of sixteen, they 

concluded the scientific evidence does not support the more 

guns, less crime proposition.  The lone dissenter was someone 

who was not an econometrician, who admitted in his dissent that 

he wished he knew more econometrics, and who had previously 

testified as an expert witness on behalf of the [INAUDIBLE] NRA.  

The other fifteen members of the committee responded to his 

dissent saying, quote, the scientific evidence does not support his 

position.  Let me just note what the NRA tries to tell you about all 

sorts of things.  This is a picture of something that you can buy 

on the NRA web site.  It’s a picture showing the Second 

Amendment.  And note the way they drape the gun across the 

page.  It’s obscuring the first half of the Second Amendment 

which starts off saying “A well regulated militia.”  That’s because 

they would try to have you believe that was not part of the 

Constitution, the idea of regulation being very central, because 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

it’s the first phrase in the Constitutional Amendment that they're 

talking about.  Now, if the NRA can't be trusted to tell you the 

truth on something that’s been on black and white paper for two 

hundred years, how likely is it that they're going to be able to tell 

you the truth on the complicated issues of evaluating what he 

impact of these laws are.  It’s a complete absurdity to think 

you're going to get the true story from the NRA and their close 

allies.  Thank you.

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, John Donohue.  When it comes to hot button issues, 

we like to have easy pigeon holes to put people in.  But our next 

speaker makes it difficult.  A professor of criminology at Florida 

State, he is, let’s see, a Democrat, a member of the ACLU, a 

member of Amnesty International.  He describes himself as an 

environmental tree-hugger.  However, when it comes to this 

issue, this classic liberal is defying all expectations by arguing 

what is normally considered the conservative side.  Gary Kleck, 

arguing for the motion that “Guns Reduce Crime.”

And yes, I'm going to vote for Barack Obama too.  [AUDIENCE 

REACTION]  Thank you, John, and thank you all for coming out 

on this very nasty night.  That is indeed an accurate rendition of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 27. 

 

 

 

my background.  The moral of that particular story is, I didn't 

come to this pro side of this debate via my ideology.  It’s the most 

unnatural thing in the world, from that standpoint.  I didn't come 

to that position by virtue of my social background.  I grew up in 

the wilds of suburbia, basically, where guns are scarce.  They 

don’t have guns to commit crimes, they don’t have guns to defend 

against crimes, they don’t have guns for hunting, they don’t have 

guns.  My way into this position is basically evidence-based.  I'm 

boringly scholarly.  I’ve been studying this issue for nearly thirty 

years, I’ve written three books, dozens of articles.  I’ve published 

more articles on the effects of defensive use of guns than anyone 

else.  Oddly enough, sometimes what you can learn from a 

debate is by listening to the silences, paying attention to what 

people would be expected to talk about, but don’t.  Strictly 

speaking, the other side actually hasn’t addressed the issue of 

the effectiveness of defensive gun use.  They’ve kind of danced 

around it, but they haven't actually addressed it head on, and in 

fact, the organization Paul Helmke represents, the Brady 

Campaign, previously Handgun Control Incorporated, used to 

have a very prominent segment of their web site devoted to the 

proposition that, no, if you try to use a gun for self-protection, 

you're going to get yourself killed, or injured, or it’s going to be 

taken away and used against you.  And they’ve more or less 

stopped talking about it, they're just silent on the issue.  That's 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 28. 

 

 

 

significant.  The reason is, the evidence is unanimous, it’s rare in 

criminological research for the findings to be unanimous on 

anything, but they're unanimous on this one. Defensive gun use 

is effective in the sense that crime victims who use guns during a 

crime are less likely to be injured or killed, and less likely to lose 

property than crime victims who adopt any other kind of strategy, 

including non-resistance.  Non-resistance is not the safest course 

of action.  And this is so despite the fact that usually when 

people try to use guns for self-protection, they're doing it under 

tougher circumstances.  They do it not because they're quick on 

the trigger, but because they're facing really desperate 

circumstances, they're likely to be outnumbered, they're likelier 

to be facing offenders with weapons, including guns, than other 

victims.  They're more likely than other victims to have already 

been injured.  And out of desperation, with all of these handicaps 

against them, then they use guns in an attempt to defend 

themselves, and from that point on they are not hurt.  Much of 

the research that previously claimed that, if you tried to use a 

gun you’d only get hurt, it had a simple error in the research that 

everybody here can understand.  It was an error in terms of what 

happened first.  Researchers would report that there were many 

incidents in which people were injured, and they used guns 

defensively.  What they didn't know, and it turned out once the 

error was corrected in the research, those were always cases 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 29. 

 

 

 

where somebody was first injured, and then used the gun for self 

protection.  It wasn’t using the gun that got them hurt, it was 

getting hurt that finally pushed them into using the gun.  When 

they fixed that flaw in the research, they basically found that 

once people used guns for self protection, they are almost never 

injured after that point.  There’s good reason why the chief’s 

police officers carry guns.  They're effective for self protection, but 

it doesn't require the unique training and experience of police 

officers for it to be effective.  It’s effective basically for everybody.  

You may not have noticed, but there’s actually more consensus 

among the six of us than might be evident at first.  I don’t think 

anybody really disputes the proposition that the effects of guns 

depends on who has them. I haven't heard anybody on the other 

side say that guns in the hands of non-criminals are just as bad 

in the hands of criminals.  It makes a huge difference.  Basically, 

guns in the hands of non-criminals, or in the hands of victims, 

regardless of any prior criminal behavior, reduce violence.  They 

reduce it in the sense that, once the gun is introduced by the 

victim, the offender stops aggressing.  Period.  Furthermore, 

defensive gun use is extremely common, contrary to Professor 

Donohue’s claims, it’s not sheer fantasy that leads us to believe 

that there are on the order of two million defensive gun uses a 

year.  It’s simply probability sampling surveys of the same sort 

that Gallop and Harris and every major survey organization uses.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 30. 

 

 

 

You just ask people questions.  You're not going to hear about 

these defensive gun uses from your newspaper, nor are the police 

going to hear about them because frankly, if you had been a 

crime victim who used a gun for self protection in a typical 

situation, you’d be insane to report it to the police.  And of course 

if the police don’t hear about it, neither will your local 

newspapers.  At best, maybe you’d be arrested for unlawful 

possession of a firearm, because most of these uses occur in 

public places where you're not supposed to have a gun, unless 

you have a special carry permit.  At worst what can happen is 

you can be arrested for the, the assault itself, a criminal assault.  

It may well be somewhere down the road, after you’ve gone 

through a legal nightmare, that you're cleared of these charges, 

but in the meanwhile you can be bankrupted from the legal 

expenses, and have your reputation ruined, and nobody reads it 

on page eighteen that, oh yeah, you know, Joe Smith was cleared 

of those charges.  So you're not going to hear about it from police 

statistics, yet scientifically conducted, objectively conducted 

surveys have, in at least twenty consecutive surveys, found that 

defensive gun use is not just common, it’s more common than 

criminal use is.  And so that’s not a fantasy, as Professor 

Donohue would have you believe, it’s about as firmly established 

a fact as we have to go on in this area.  Thank you very much.

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Gary Kleck.  Another defier of easy pigeon-holing is 

the man who is President of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun 

Violence, an organization that is the forefront of the gun control 

movement.  He is a Republican, and he is the former Mayor of 

Indianapolis.  He has said that his position on gun control had a 

lot to do with nearly losing two close friends in a gun accident.  

This was during the time when they were all teenagers together.  

Now, all of these years later, we are pleased to introduce as our 

final speaker, and speaking against the motion that “Guns 

Reduce Crime,” Paul Helmke.   

[APPLAUSE]  

PAUL HELMKE 

It’s great to be here tonight.  I'm, just for the record, I was Mayor 

of Fort Wayne, Indiana, not Indianapolis, but another great city 

in the state of Indiana.  I came to this issue as a mayor.  Not only 

had I had the experience, when I was a teenager, of seeing a 

friend get a bullet in the back because of the all too common 

incident of, we found a gun, we didn't know it was loaded, which 

happens every day in this country.  But as a mayor, I saw what 

happens in a community when there are so many guns, and 

when we make it so easy for dangerous people to get guns.  I had 

police officers, one case I still remember well, I got the call in the 

middle of the night from the police chief, our labor relations 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

director, a police chief, married to a police officer, they kept a gun 

at their headboard.  They wanted to be safe.  They knew how to 

use the gun.  They were police officers.  They had a fight, 

domestic quarrel.  She ended up dead.  That happens a lot in this 

country.  Actually, the statistics show that if you’ve got a gun in 

your home, it’s twenty-two times more likely to be used against 

you or a family member than to protect you.  Think about that 

again.  Twenty-two times more likely.  And part of the reason is 

that the world doesn't easily divide into the good guys and bad 

guys, because there’s always sort of a chance that any of us can 

get angry, any of us can get drunk, and if the gun is there, what’s 

going to happen with that gun?  When you look at the arguments 

for the proponents here, basically they talk about these two 

million defensive uses, and as Professor Donohue said, that’s a 

questionable number.  Yes, it was based on probability sampling.  

There were sixty-six people who responded to a poll that said 

they used a gun defensively.  Sixty-six, and then you extrapolate 

that by the adult population of the US, and you get two million 

gun uses.  Just sixty-six.  When you do sampling and have such 

a small affirmative number, and then you multiply it by huge 

things, you get these outrageous things.  Based on that, more 

people have been in flying saucers in this country.  It shows what 

happens with statistics.  Actually, when I was running for Mayor 

of Fort Wayne, I learned quickly how statistics--how it works.  I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 33. 

 

 

 

was running against an incumbent.  I looked at what had 

happened in crime in my community, and there had been times 

when crime went up.  And so I'm digging out the statistics.  The 

police chief at one time said, yes, crime was up because the 

economy was down.  People lost their jobs, they were going to 

commit crimes.  Then I found another clip from two years later, 

he said, well, crime is up because the economy is good, more 

people have things to steal.  You can take statistics and do 

whatever you want with them so many times.  The one statistic 

that doesn't lie are deaths.  You have to do probability sampling 

for these other things, but when you look at deaths, you get the 

shocking statistics.  That thirty-two people are killed with guns, 

murdered with guns every day in this country.  That’s a Virginia 

Tech happening every day in this country.  Thirty thousand 

people die from guns every year.  That includes the suicides and 

the accidents.  You get the situation like just a couple days ago in 

Massachusetts, some kid is shooting a machine gun at some gun 

show, and he kills himself because he can't hold it.  What is 

going wrong with this country?  Thirty thousand deaths.  And 

then when you combine the seventy thousand people that are 

injured every year, people like Jim Brady, who, by the way, was 

with President Reagan at the time, surrounded by people with 

guns, the Secret Service.  That didn't stop them from getting shot. 

Those guns didn't reduce that crime.  The other argument that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 34. 

 

 

 

the proponents seem to make, is they're holding up this straw 

man of the gun bans, and how gun bans don’t work.  And you 

can argue the statistics.  Actually, after DC had their hand gun 

ban, gun suicides went down twenty-three percent, gun 

homicides went down twenty-five percent when you looked at a 

ten year period.  So, there’s a lot of statistics there.  But the real 

issue is not gun bans.  We're not talking about gun bans, we’re 

talking about the question, do more guns reduce crime?  And it’s 

clear that the more guns you get out there, the more likely those 

guns are going to be stolen.  Where do you think the criminals 

get these guns?  That these guns are going to be trafficked.  

Where do you think the criminals get these guns?  Misused?  

Where do you think accidents happen from?  Used in road rage.  

Used in the domestic violence situation. It’s the guns that add to 

the problem.  Other countries in the world have the same level, 

generally, of rapes, and of burglaries, and of robberies, and of 

assaults that we do, industrialized countries.  But we are far and 

away the most deadly country when it comes to gun crime, 

because we have so many guns.  In fact, if you think about it for 

a second, if the proposition were true that guns reduce crime, we 

should be the safest country in the world, and we’re not.  And it’s 

because we do have so many guns, and those guns too easily get 

in the wrong hands.  And actually, when you think about this 

proposition, rather than voting to say that guns reduce crime, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 35. 

 

 

 

you should stop and think that really restricting access to guns is 

what would reduce crime.  We’re coming up on the fifteen year 

anniversary of the Brady Bill.  The Brady Bill said, instead of 

taking an individual’s word whether they're a felon or mentally 

dangerous, let’s do a background check.  The Brady--you know, 

bright idea, right?  Don’t just say, are you a felon?  No, of course 

not.  You know, it’s a…  The Brady Background check system 

has stopped one point six million people from buying guns who 

weren't allowed to buy guns.  We had a situation just last week in 

Virginia where somebody went in to buy a gun, turns out there’s 

a murder warrant for them in Baltimore, and the person got 

arrested.  You know, criminals, like the chief said, aren't always 

the brightest people in the world.  In fact, this guy tried to argue, 

well, I didn't commit the murder, I wouldn't have gone and 

bought a gun if I…  It didn't make any sense.  Brady background 

checks work.  If we decide that some people are probably more 

prone to violence, again, people with a felony record, people that 

are dangerously mentally ill, let’s stop them from buying those 

guns, let’s use background checks, let’s have them in all sales, 

not just from federally licensed dealers.  Let’s do things to stop 

gun trafficking.  Do you realize that you can go in and buy eighty-

one of the same make and model of a gun tomorrow, and what do 

you think is going to happen when someone did that in Charlie 

Brown’s Gun Store in Dayton, Ohio a few years back, eighty-one 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

of the same make and model?  They sell them out of the trunk of 

their car.  People don’t realize how weak our gun laws are in this 

country.  We basically allow almost anyone to get any kind of a 

gun.  Last thing I wanted to comment on is the Supreme Court 

case.  The Supreme Court case, while making it clear that gun 

bans are off the table, made it clear that we can have reasonable 

restrictions, that we can restrict who gets the guns, where they 

take the guns, how the guns are sold, how the guns are stored, 

and what, and all the things that deal with guns. That’s where 

this debate should come down.  I'm not anti-gun.  I’ve got my 

NRA pro-marksmanship badge from when I was in sixth grade.  

My friends all went hunting and did these things too.  But once 

you see how easy we make it for dangerous people to get guns, 

you’ll conclude that you should vote against the proposition.  

Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Paul Helmke, and I apologize to the people of Fort 

Wayne, Indiana.  The mistake was mine alone, but I'm very much 

reminded of the fact that we are not in Indiana, that we are in 

New York City, because we have the numbers in.  Polling the 

audience before the debate on the motion, and we’re going to put 

them up on the screen now, the motion being “Guns Reduce 

Crime.”   Thirteen percent of you supported this motion before 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

the debate, sixty percent of you opposed the motion, and twenty-

seven percent were undecided.  We’ll be polling you again toward 

the end of the debate to see whether any minds have been 

changed.  We’re going to begin the section now,  where the 

debaters address one another and also take questions from you, 

the audience.  And again, I would very much encourage any of 

you who are here to participate.  If you have expertise in the field, 

that is so much the better.  Again, we would encourage you to 

keep your questions exceedingly short.  What you need to do is 

raise your hand, and we have ushers who are moving around the 

aisles, and will come to you, and locate you.  But I just want to go 

to John Lott, who, in a sense, your work embodies this motion 

that guns reduce crime, and your statistical work embodies that 

motion.  And yet tonight I heard some of the fundamental work 

you’re done referred to as a fantasy.  And I heard the question 

raised by former Mayor Helmke, if guns prevent crime, why isn't 

this the most safe nation in the world?  What is the answer to 

that, and what about the fantasy issue?   

JOHN LOTT 

Well, I mean, there are lots of academics that have, I’ll just take 

the fantasy issue first.  There are lots of academics who have 

looked at the relationship between concealed hand gun laws and 

crime rates, and if you look at papers published in refereed 

academic journals by economists and criminologists, you’ll find 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 38. 

 

 

 

about seventy percent of them find that when right to carry laws 

get passed, there’s drops in violent crime rates.  About thirty 

percent say there’s no change that’s there.  And then there’s not 

one refereed academic journal that I know of that finds that 

there’s a bad effect from these.  So there’s a lot of people that 

looked at this in many different ways.   

JOHN DONOHUE 

John, John, you're ignoring the National Academy of Science 

Panel— 

JOHN LOTT 

I'm happy to— 

JOHN DONOHUE 

15 to one, including some of the top econometricians in the 

country— 

JOHN LOTT 

Right.   

JOHN DONOHUE 

—and their conclusion was your work is not supported by the 

scientific evidence.  

GARY KLECK 

Not true, we’re experts on it, their opinions on that issue have 

absolutely nothing to do with it, John’s talking about what 

experts thought.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 39. 

 

 

 

JOHN LOTT 

But the promise— 

GARY KLECK 

And the real debate is simply between people who say there is a 

beneficial effect, versus those who say there’s no effect.  There 

basically is no, no participation on John’s side, on John 

Donohue’s side.  Basically there is no support for the view it has 

counterproductive violence-elevating effects.   

JOHN LOTT 

But just to respond to the National Academy of Sciences, I mean, 

unfortunately I think, there’s a problem with government getting 

involved in evaluating research, and it’s very hard for the 

government to keep politics out of it.  This was a panel set up by 

the Clinton administration; I don’t think it was unbiased— 

JOHN DONOHUE 

This was not a panel set up by the Clinton administration— 

JOHN LOTT 

It was started there.  But the point is, what James Q. Wilson, 

who’s this hack that you were referring to, and I think a lot of 

people would regard James Q. Wilson as probably the top 

criminologist in the country, he was the person who was 

dissenting on this.   And what…Jim showed, was that if you look 

at every single one of the National Academy of Sciences estimates 

on the impact of right-to-carry laws on murder rates, every single 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 40. 

 

 

 

one of their own estimates showed that right-to-carry laws 

reduced murder rates.   And if you looked at their other things, 

virtually all their other estimates for all the other types of crimes 

showed reductions in those also— 

JOHN DONOHUE 

John, I have the report—  

JOHN LOTT 

There was no estimate— 

JOHN DONOHUE 

I have the report right here— 

JOHN LOTT 

—not one estimate, that the National— 

JOHN DONOHUE 

I have the report right in front of me, and it does not support 

what you just said.  

JOHN LOTT 

Is it true or is it not true that every regression, every estimate 

that they had on right-to-carry and murder showed a drop.  Is 

there one estimate they showed that it didn't fall?   

JOHN DONOHUE 

Yeah— 

JOHN LOTT 

Statistically—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 41. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONOHUE 

Yeah, there are some, not— maybe not statistically significant, 

but— [LAUGHTER]  But, the bottom line, John, is, as the panel 

suggested, the elephant in the room was crack cocaine.  The 

states that did not pass the right-to-carry laws were states that 

had a big problem with crack cocaine which had an enormous 

influence in running up crime.   

JOHN LOTT 

Now, that’s— 

JOHN DONOHUE 

The rural states that did pass these laws did not experience the 

big run-up in crime, and when you do your analysis, it is the 

difference between the flat performance in the rural states, and 

the increases in crime that generates that result.  That’s why—   

JOHN LOTT 

That’s simply not true—   

JOHN DONOHUE 

—James Q. Wilson was outvoted 15 to 1.   

JOHN LOTT 

Look—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, I—I think we have impasse on this…  And I—   

[LAUGHTER]  I wanna go to Chief Kerlikowske, Seattle police 

chief, because you were talking about British bobbies being 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

unarmed, and preferring that in many situations because they 

felt being armed would invite assault, and yet Gary Kleck arguing 

for the motion said why are police armed in the first place unless 

it is to deter assault, do you—can you take that on?   

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

Yes I can, and, remember what Truman said, if I could line up all 

the economists end to end, wouldn’t that be a beautiful sight, so 

that, I just—  [LAUGHTER]  And one, and one is on my panel.  

So…getting away from the statistics and going to that police 

officers are highly trained with firearms.   They practice and 

qualify, they can’t graduate from the academy with qualifying.  

Without question, they can use the gun in a defensive mode.  But 

when you look at the numbers of police officers in the United 

States and I remember—I can picture every moment to this day, 

of the first time I had an officer killed in the line of duty.  Young, 

bright, talented, incredible shape, shot 13 times with his own 

handgun.  Wasn’t a question of training, wasn’t a question of 

anything else.  Officers are routinely wounded and assaulted with 

their own guns.  That’s why—  

GARY KLECK 

That’s not true, that’s absolutely not true—   

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

Officers are routinely assaulted—

Gary—Gary Kleck is—   

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

But anyhow—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—objecting, but Gary, hold off—    

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

There was a—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—[UNCLEAR]—   

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

—the entire reason that the entire gun industry made significant 

changes in holsters.   It used to be that we all wanted the quick-

draw holster, how fast could we get the holster out.  Now the 

holsters are designed, they’re cumbersome, they’re heavy, they 

are not quick-draw and they are designed and sold by the 

millions across this country for one reason and that is because of 

officers having the gun taken from them.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Gary—Gary Kleck is—

JOHN DONVAN 

—Gary Kleck, I just want to remind our radio listeners, Gary 

Kleck is arguing for the motion, the liberal…who works just from 

the numbers.  [LAUGHTER]   

GARY KLECK 

You know, here’s a number for you and it’s a very easy number to 

understand, for the most recent years for which we have data in 

the entire United States, there was exactly one police officer killed 

with his own gun, one.  It is—you can stretch the concept 

“routinely” quite a bit but I don’t think one—  

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

But Gary, how many officers—   

GARY KLECK 

—out of 600,000 police officers in the entire United States—   

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE  

But how many were actually shot—    

GARY KLECK 

—can really be described as routine.  That’s, that’s some 

indication of the chief’s credibility when he says something 

happens frequently or routinely, one in 600,000 is not routine—   

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

But Gary, you left out the number of the number of officers—  

GARY KLECK 

And—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 45. 

 

 

 

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

—actually killed—    

GARY KLECK 

—what he fails to point out—  

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

—very small—   

GARY KLECK 

—is that police officers in fact are not assaulted anywhere near as 

often as civilians, and he’s right, there’s a very straightforward 

reason, they’re all armed with firearms, and trained.   

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

But—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Chief—Chief—let the Chief respond [UNCLEAR]—    

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

I mean, actually you’d have to be pretty stupid to assault an 

armed police officer who has a baton, a uniform, a radio—   

GARY KLECK 

Indeed you would—   

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

—a gun, pepper spray and extra ammunition and is wearing body 

armor.  That probably is quite correct.  But there are very few 

because of body armor and the changes in body armor in this 

country, there are very few police officers now killed or wounded 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 46. 

 

 

 

in the line of duty, that the number—that the numbers that we 

used to see.  So to say yes, one out of what, but what, 45 officers 

killed, shot—   

GARY KLECK 

There were never many—   

JOHN LOTT 

So the ratio—   

GARY KLECK 

There were never many even 20 years ago or 30 years ago before 

the advent of body armor, it was no more true than now, it’s 

simply untrue—   

JOHN LOTT 

Yeah, you’re talking about at most five a year or so, even in the 

high years that that is.  Look, five, it’d be better if it was zero but 

if you look at the number of police officers who are assaulted in a 

year you’re talking about between 16 and 20,000.   And so if 

you’re asking, what’s the rate of a police officer who’s assaulted, 

who’s going to lose control of his weapon and have it used against 

him—and going to result in his death, it’s a tiny number, but 

even more important I think to make is a comparison to civilians, 

because that’s partly the motivation for this.   And police officers 

have a much more difficult job than civilians do, a police officer 

can’t brandish a gun, watch the criminal run away, and be 

satisfied that his job’s over with.  If he has to come into physical 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 47. 

 

 

 

contact with the criminal, and you’re much more likely to have 

something go wrong.   One of the benefits a civilian has, if you 

take a right-to-carry class to get your permit someplace, one of 

the things they’re going to tell you is you’re not the police.  Your 

job isn’t to go and arrest people.   The benefit that you have of 

having a gun, is to maximize the distance between yourself and 

the criminal.  If he runs away, that’s basically what you’re done 

with, and that’s the reason why you had the gun.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Paul Helmke—   

PAUL HELMKE 

Yeah, I—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—Paul Helmke, as a former mayor of Fort Wayne to whom the 

police reported, were you surprised to hear Stephen Halbrook, 

who represents the NRA, say that police do not have a 

responsibility to protect individuals?   

PAUL HELMKE 

It’s—  [LAUGHS]  I think Steve’s playing legalisms with what 

really happens, I mean the general slogan for most police 

departments is “To protect and defend.”  I mean it’s their job to 

get out there, now they—   

JOHN DONVAN  

But his argument is that—    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 48. 

 

 

 

PAUL HELMKE 

His argument is that you can’t sue them if they haven’t 

responded [UNCLEAR]—   

JOHN DONVAN  

His argument really is because the police can’t do it people have 

to do it for themselves.    

PAUL HELMKE 

And let me address that argument, it’s Steve’s argument, at some 

extent, is true.  People do have a right of self-defense.  The 

Supreme Court made that very clear in the Heller case, you 

know, I do wonder a little bit about Justice Roberts’s comments 

that he wasn’t, you know, he wanted to be able to shoot his gun 

but he needed to turn on the light and put on his reading glasses 

before that, and that’s the example Steve just gave and I thought 

gee, if the Chief Justice  needs to put on his glasses and turn the 

light on before he can shoot maybe, he shouldn’t be shooting, 

but—   It gets into the issue of, yes, people do have a—  

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

[INAUDIBLE]    

PAUL HELMKE 

People do have a right of self-defense.  But what we do when we 

live in communities is we set up police departments because 

they’re the individuals that are trained, they’re the individuals 

that respond.  And often when an individual has a gun in their 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 49. 

 

 

 

home, again as I said it’s 22 times more likely to be used against 

them or a family member.   Homes with more guns have more 

gun violence, cities with more guns have more gun violence, 

states with more guns, countries with more guns, more gun 

violence, now that includes gun suicides and gun accidents, not 

just gun homicides.  And when you talk about police 

departments—I ran the police department.   20 percent of the 

time that an officer’s shot it’s his gun or his partner’s, so you’ve 

gotta expand that to the partner’s gun.  20 percent of the time 

when an officer’s in a shoot-out situation, they miss their target—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Well, you’re running—  

PAUL HELMKE 

—only 20 percent of the time do they hit their target—  

JOHN DONVAN 

—into a lot of numbers here, I want to give Stephen a chance to 

respond, Stephen Halbrook of the NRA—   

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

There’s something really bizarre about this picture that citizens 

with guns are totally incompetent and police with guns are totally 

incompetent and they’re likely to be taken away from them, but 

somehow criminals are really good with guns, where— where did 

they get all this training.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 50. 

 

 

 

PAUL HELMKE 

Well, they’re not that good—   

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

There’s something bizarre about this picture that, citizens and 

police cannot defend themselves with guns but criminals can 

successfully use guns to aggress against other people, it doesn’t 

make—it’s against common sense.  I’m not a statistician, I don’t 

think Paul is either, we’re the two who aren’t here but it just 

doesn’t make sense to say that you should never be able to 

protect yourself, that you shouldn’t use a gun, that you’re 

incompetent, that you’re totally worthless with it and—it’s just, 

against any common sense.   And, the fact that, this is not just a 

legalism, police have no duty to protect you.  It’s not their fault 

by the way, of course their slogan is to protect and serve, they 

want to do that.  But they have no legal compulsion to do it and 

of course even if you could sue them if they didn’t protect you 

after the kinds of scenarios we talked about, it wouldn’t do you 

any good, you may be dead or you’re otherwise injured.  You 

want to be able to prevent the crime from happening.  And the 

only way to do that in some circumstances is you have to be able 

to protect yourself.    

JOHN DONVAN  

We’re going to go to the audience for some questions, now there 

are a lot of hands up and what we’re gonna do is pick out… take 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

two or three questions, do the questions first and then we’ll 

repeat them to the panel, so, why don’t you take that one right 

there…?  Brief, please.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Um—    

JOHN DONVAN  

And I’m collecting questions so it’s me and then I’ll relay them.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

To the gentlemen…for the motion, if you believe that guns reduce 

crimes, would you recommend that your children keep a gun 

handy.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you.  Down here?  I’ll come back.  Sorry, here?   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Yes, I think that we’re conflating statistical data about societies 

and societal factors with the guns themselves.  So I am not clear 

where you have had a concealed-carry law put into place, within 

that particular community so you can hold constant for crack 

use, or non-crack use, rural or urban.   What has been the 

result, does it reduce crime, does it increase crime, and the other 

thing that I would appreciate you speaking to, is the word 

“regulate” in the second amendment, it seems to me that in our 

history, people regularly had gun ownership and it was not 

something that was precluded, so addressing that point and how

it affected our—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you—   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

—opinions would be helpful.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you.  Right to your left…?    

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Hi, I have a very quick question that’s a little bit more specific 

than just a broad topic.  Do you think that gun buy-back 

programs, help reduce crime and if yes, who evaluates these 

programs and why are they started in the first place—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay—thank you, we—those are good, those are all questions 

and they’re quite good and brief.  [LAUGHTER]  Should kids have 

guns to protect themselves, I suppose, what age are you talking 

about, when would you say— start saying this is a reasonable 

question to ask.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Um—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Microphone to your mouth.

old enough to have children over 18 or 21.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Mm-hmm.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I was wondering, their own children, would they recommend 

that their own children—   

JOHN DONVAN 

For self-defense.  Not for hunting, not for sport—   

JOHN LOTT 

Yeah—  

JOHN DONVAN 

—self-defense.  Gentlemen, any of you support guns for children 

for self-defense.   

JOHN LOTT 

I hope my kids have guns—   

JOHN DONVAN 

This is John Lott answering.  Sorry, John, I spoke over you, go 

ahead?   

JOHN LOTT 

I mean I hope my kids have guns, when they get—I mean I didn’t 

own a gun until 1996 after I’d started doing the research that I 

did.  As far as I know my family had never owned a gun.  But at 

this point, given that I believe the benefits far outweigh the risks, 

I think I’d be disappointed if my kids didn’t own a gun.

JOHN DONVAN  

Anybody on the other side respond to that?   

PAUL HELMKE 

I wouldn’t want my daughter to have a gun.   

JOHN DONVAN 

That’s Paul Helmke—   

PAUL HELMKE 

When I look at the statistics about how that adds to the risk of 

suicide, the risk of being misused, the risk of it coming up, being 

stolen, used in a domestic quarrel, I think it’s just too much of a 

risk.    

JOHN DONVAN  

John Donahue against the motion.   

JOHN DONOHUE 

There’s also the social factor that the NRA and our other 

panelists want to ignore.  Sean Penn got the right to carry a 

concealed handgun in California which is tough to do, went to a 

Berkeley restaurant for lunch one day, came back, his gun was—

his two guns that he had left in his car were gone because the car 

had been stolen.   They got a car back, a few days later, but the 

two guns were missing, so maybe it might’ve helped him at some 

point, but now somebody’s got Sean Penn’s guns, and I suspect 

it’s a criminal—

JOHN DONVAN 

Okay, we’re a little—   

JOHN DONOHUE 

—that’s not going to use them very effectively—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—we’re a little off the point of the question about children who 

are—the second question went to whether there are studies that 

show the impact of a concealed-carry law within a given 

community actually having had an impact, before that I have a 

question.  How is a concealed weapon a deterrent, to the guy who 

can’t see it.  [LAUGHTER]    

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

Because they don’t know who has it, and if you have a—  

JOHN DONVAN 

So the community has it, in other words—   

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

If you’re in a state that has mandatory issuance of concealed-

weapon permits, then criminals have no knowledge of who might 

be carrying legally, and you would think there would be more 

who would carry if it is legal than those who would do it out of 

desperation because of fear—   

JOHN DONVAN  

So people who would not be carrying in that community would 

also be protected under that theory, because—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 56. 

 

 

 

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

Absolutely, because the criminals don’t know who has the gun.    

JOHN DONVAN  

John Lott, you were going answer the question that the 

questioner put to us—   

JOHN LOTT 

Right—  

JOHN DONVAN 

—about whether the, sta—there is a—   

JOHN LOTT 

No, excellent question, actually.  And, that’s precisely what you 

want to do, you don’t want to just compare across places 

because, you know, Idaho is different than California and 

England has a different underlying crime rate before they change 

any types of gun control laws than the United States has.   And 

so what you’re doing in these tests is, you’re precisely doing that, 

you’re seeing how crime rates change in a state after that state’s 

adopted right-to-carry laws, and how that change is comparing to 

other places that didn’t change their laws over that period of 

time.   And there are lots of other things you’ll do, you’ll see, as 

that state issues more permits, you know, is there a greater drop 

that you see…Stephen Halbrook was just mentioning is the 

probability that a criminal may come across somebody who’s able 

to defend themselves, is there some relationship between the

increased risk that the criminal faces and, and further drops in 

crime.   But, you know, that’s exactly the way that you want to do 

the test and all the tests that I do, that’s precisely the type of 

test—   

JOHN DONVAN  

I’m seeing a great deal of skeptical looks from the opposing table.  

John—

All the tests that John do—

They did not conclude the opposite.

They concluded that the data does not support the proposition

GARY KLECK 

—persistently said was, we don’t have strong enough evidence to 

draw firm conclusions about virtually every issue they addressed, 

so, that was more of  a no-decision decision than it was reaching 

the opposite conclusion, they did not reach the conclusion that 

making it easy to get a carry permit increases crime.   They did 

not conclude that John Lott was wrong, and basically, you know, 

you learn nothing from what that particular panel said—

necessary.  I mean—  [LAUGHTER]    

PAUL HELMKE 

One of the things, just real quick on concealed-carry—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Paul Helmke—   

PAUL HELMKE 

—The real issue is, who makes the decision on whether you’re 

getting a concealed-carry permit, and, and the real difference 

between states are those where it’s a shall-issue or versus may-

issue.  And a lot of states as the [UNCLEAR]—   

JOHN DONVAN  

You have to explain what shall-and-may means—  

PAUL HELMKE 

Yeah, I was going to do that, shall-issue states, it basically, 

someone fills out a form, sometimes they don’t have to take a 

class, a lot of times in Utah they don’t even have to live in the 

state.  Sometimes you can just send in a form that says, yes, I 

listened to a video or whatever, and send— here’s my check, and 

you get a concealed-carry permit.   In other states it actually goes 

to the Chief of Police or to the Sheriff, who does a check to see 

whether you—not only is your record clean but, in terms of the 

felony conviction, but they check to see are the police responding 

to your house every week because of domestic quarrels, is this a 

kid that you’ve had to arrest a number of times on minor things

that aren’t going to be a disqualifier.   Then the police have some 

discretion, I had a police chief who turned down somebody for a 

gun because—he had a clean record, turns out the kid had been 

acquitted of killing his parents in a neighboring country five years 

earlier.   It was questionable whether he should’ve been 

acquitted, it was one of those cases.  My chief turned him down a 

few years later when it was easier to get those guns, he ended up 

killing his brother, brother-in-law, neighbor, with one of his 25 

AK-47’s that he kept in the attic, so—   It’s give the police a little 

more discretion on who’s getting these guns.  Right now, 48 of 

the 50 states have some version of either may issue or shall 

issue, so it’s hard to make comparisons between states that do 

and don’t have these things—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Let’s bring Chief Kerlikowske also to address the gun buy-back 

questioner.    

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

I will, I think the issue for us is clearly that there has to be far 

more than being mobile and not being blind as a reason to give 

someone a firearms permit.  And just within the last several 

months at one of the largest festivals in the city, the Folklife 

Festival, tens of thousands of people and literally dozens of police 

officers, officers within spitting distance in fact of the crowd, a 

young man who had been on methadone, who had had a number 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 61. 

 

 

 

of other problems, had a license issued by the Sheriff in a 

neighboring county, so that he could carry a concealed firearm 

anywhere.  And in the middle of this crowd he looked at someone, 

that person looked at him and they got into a fight, the gun went 

off and it not only discharged across the assailant, the person 

that he was fighting with--and all they’d been fighting with were 

their hands--the gun also then ended up going through the hand  

of a young man and into the thigh of another woman.  That is a 

person that should’ve never had a concealed firearms permit.  On 

the issue of gun buy-backs I think the research is pretty clear, 

does it deter crime, does it result in guns being taken off the 

street that are crime guns…  A lot of times they’re old guns, 

they’re guns that are not being used in crimes and they’re being 

found by people cleaning out garages, et cetera.  Taking those 

guns off the street is not a bad thing, remember a hundred-year-

old firearm can kill someone.  But I don’t think we see it as a 

huge issue as far as reducing crime.   

JOHN DONVAN  

John, could you—just one second, I have just a little bit of 

business I need to do for our radio broadcast, to remind everyone 

that I’m John Donvan of ABC News and this is Intelligence 

Squared US, Oxford-style debating, we have six panelists, three 

for and three against the motion, “Guns reduce crime,” we are in 

the head-to-head section of the debate and taking questions from 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

the audience—John Lott.    

JOHN LOTT 

On the gun buy-back issue, I don’t know of one single academic 

study by any type of academic, that finds that they reduce any 

type of violent crime rate.  We could talk about that more if you 

want to, but—   One question that keeps on coming up here, a 

point from the other side is that, people with concealed handgun 

permits, they may do bad things.  And it’s easy to check.  In the 

state of Washington you’ve had permits being issued since 1960.   

The type of incident that there was, this wounding, is the only 

case I know like that in the state of Washington, nobody has been 

convicted of murder for example in Washington that’s had a 

concealed-carry permit, and you’re talking about almost 50 

years.   And you see that in state after state.  In Florida, you can 

go to the website for the department that issues permits, and 

they have detailed data there, you find that, from October 1987 

through September 31st of this year, they had issued over 1.41 

million permits to 1.41 million people.  Of those people, 166 had 

had their permits revoked for any type of firearms violation.   

Virtually all those were for one type of violation, that was 

someone who accidentally carried a concealed handgun into a 

gun-free zone like an airport or what have you—    

PAUL HELMKE 

It’s interesting that—

JOHN LOTT 

[UNCLEAR]  

PAUL HELMKE 

—the Sun-Sentinel, did a study in 2006, before the legislature 

closed off this website, this is the new move by the way, is that 

the gun pushers come in and they say we don’t want this 

information to be public because we don’t want you to know 

what’s happening with the concealed carry permit holders.   But 

the Sun-Sentinel found 216 people with active warrants, 128 with 

domestic violence restraining orders, nine people charged with 

felonies or reckle—or violent reckless demeanors, six red—

registered sex offenders, at least one prison inmate, and another 

1400 people who had pled guilty or no-contest to felony charges, 

all had concealed-carry permits in the state of Florida—  

GARY KLECK 

[UNCLEAR]—   

PAUL HELMKE 

And then—and the Florida legislature, said, we don’t want to 

make this information public anymore.

[UNCLEAR]—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Gary Kleck says that Paul Helmke is leaving something out—   

GARY KLECK 

But notice what Paul is leaving out of that, you may have been 

listening for how many people did something with their gun that 

they are now legally entitled to carry around in public places.  

How many times did they commit a violent crime in a public 

place, that’s the oily thing a carry permit allows you to do that 

you couldn’t do without the permit.   In fact, none of those people 

did a violent crime with a gun in a public place and the fact that 

they had carry permits had absolutely nothing to do with 

anything, there was no—   

JOHN DONVAN  

We’re gonna go back to—   

GARY KLECK

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Right, my question is for those who are in favor of the 

proposition.  Isn’t there a distinction between a handgun, and a 

more excessive weapon like an AK-47, would you have the same 

attitude toward those more—    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you.  That’s— I take the point, in the, in the back?  Yes, 

sir.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

The question went unanswered earlier, why isn’t the United 

States the safest country in the world, if we have so many guns, 

and if you add to that, the fact that the incarceration rate here is 

so high so theoretically we’ve already taken off a large amount of 

criminals from the street.   

JOHN LOTT 

Can I answer that—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Well, we’ll come to the third question, I just wanna bring in a 

third question, where, do we have a mic?  Okay.  You have a 

bunch of hands around here.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I’m just wondering with, regards to illegal gun ownership, how,  

no one has addressed exactly how to reduce that.  You know, 

we’re talking about increasing the supply of guns.  How about 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 66. 

 

 

 

reducing the supply to criminals and people that shouldn’t have 

them.    

JOHN DONVAN  

I’m going to not take the question because it’s a little bit off the 

point of our actual motion, with respect, but thank you, we’ll take 

one more?  Can you move to the lady…  I—you can’t see, but a 

little bit forward?  She’s standing to you?  Thank you.   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

To the whole panel, can you back off a bit, and say what exactly 

would constitute supporting or refuting the proposition that gun 

reduces crime [sic].  How would you, um, adjust for, um…other 

contributing circumstances, how do you evaluate what is 

anecdotal evidence and what is significant evidence, how can you 

determine that you’re comparing, not comparing apples and 

oranges.   Surely, calling the NRA execrable doesn’t constitute 

evidence one way or another so—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Okay, we take your point on the question and thank you for it.  Is 

an AK-47 something that people should have a right to carry 

around, in the—on the same terms as a handgun.  Stephen 

Halbrook, who represents the NRA—   

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

The Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms 

and the question is what kinds of arms are Constitutionally 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

protected and the Supreme Court just addressed that in the 

Heller case and said that, handguns are commonly possessed by 

law-abiding citizens historically for lawful purposes.  Rifles and 

shotguns, now, the term AK-47 is very ambiguous, if it means a 

real AK-47 that means a fully automatic machine gun.  They’re 

very highly restricted in this country, they have to be registered 

with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.   

They’re not possessed by that many people, they’re not used in 

crimes by the way, registered AK-47’s, there’s not very many of 

them around.  But that’s really never where the debate has been, 

the debate has always been, for example the Brady Center 

supporting the D.C. handgun ban.   What people are concerned 

about is the ability to have a normal kind of gun in their house to 

protect themselves and to have rifles, pistols and shotguns for 

sporting purposes or other lawful purposes.  The debate has 

never been about AK-47, there’s been… there are certain kinds of 

rifles that might look like an AK-47 and they’re called by the 

press assault weapons but they’re not assault weapons and 

they’re not AK-47’s, they just have certain cosmetic features that 

are similar, so—    

JOHN DONVAN  

But from a public relations point of view I think the question 

makes some sense if it’s put in terms of do you—are there certain 

categories that should be restricted more from the public than 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

handguns are.    

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

Real AK-47’s, I don’t know of anybody who advocates 

deregulating them under current, the federal law which is very 

strict—    

PAUL HELMKE 

Steve, didn’t you file—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Paul Helmke—   

PAUL HELMKE 

—something with the Supreme Court arguing that the machine 

gun ban was unconstitutional?  I mean you’ve argued that 

machine guns should be allowed, right—    

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

The—   

GARY KLECK 

You know, this whole thing is really a red herring—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Wait, let Stephen answer that, that was a question to Stephen.    

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

Right, the National Firearms Act passed in 1934 provides that, 

certain kinds of highly restricted firearms can be registered and 

possessed by law-abiding citizens who go through these extreme 

background checks and…   If you were to pass a ban on any kind

of gun it does raise questions under the Second Amendment as 

well as the Interstate Commerce Clause, and there was a 

Supreme Court where we raised that issue.  We did not argue 

that machine guns were protected by the Second Amendment, we 

argued that, a constitutional issue was raised by whether they 

should be banned or not and it’s something that—   It had to do 

with a statutory interpretation, it’s not a case that was a Second 

Amendment case—the only Second Amendment case the 

Supreme Court has dealt with is the Heller case, and it’s decided 

that the kind of guns that we’re all ordinarily talking about here,  

rifles, pistols and handguns are the ones that are, I’m sorry, 

rifles, shotguns and handguns are the ones that are 

constitutionally protected— these other issues are red herrings.  

JOHN DONVAN 

Gary Kleck, your fellow team member—   

GARY KLECK 

I think it’s kind of ironic here that we hear an echo of the NRA’s 

old slippery slope argument, you know, that if they have even 

moderate control it’ll eventually lead to prohibition, this is kind of 

the flip-side of that.  That if we in any way allow non-criminal 

citizens to have guns for self-protection that it’s bound to lead 

somehow down a slippery slope to everybody having machine 

guns and opening up in church on Sunday—

JOHN DONVAN 

—simultaneous conversation actually is not working—   

PAUL HELMKE 

I’ve got no problems with folks, I’ve got no problems with folks 

owning guns for hunting, for collecting, for self-defense, I want 

them to make sure they understand the responsibilities that go 

with that gun, I want them to know that the Heller case says that 

there are restrictions that you’re allowed to have on guns and 

that governments can do those restrictions.   And I think if you 

get that commonsense approach and realize we got gun bans off 

the table, and we’ve got the whole idea of anybody, any gun, 

anywhere, anytime is off the table too, let’s figure out what can 

work to make our communities safer in the middle.   That means 

I think some restrictions on these large-capacity clips, 

restrictions on machine guns, doing the background checks, 

limiting the number of guns you can buy at one time—

JOHN DONVAN 

I want to wrap this up because our third questioner asked the 

question for the third time tonight, if the United States has so 

many handguns why is it not the safest nation in the world, and 

John Lott, I think the question—  Or Gary Kleck, you can answer 

it.    

GARY KLECK 

And my response is, you know, if we have 600,000 police officers, 

more than any other democracy in the world, why didn’t we 

eliminate crime.  You know, if we lock up two million people in 

prison, why didn’t it eliminate crime.  The simple answer is no 

one solution is going to solve crime and no one proposed that it 

did, that’s a non-argument.   Nothing is a perfect solution or a 

complete solution and you hear no one on this panel make that 

argument.  It’s just a matter of given that we don’t have a 

complete solution to the problem, what do we do in the 

meanwhile, what do we do right now, what do individuals do, and 

why would you want to prevent them from doing something that 

makes them safer.    

JOHN DONVAN  

And John Lott, you’re gonna have the final word in this section, 

go ahead—   

JOHN LOTT 

Okay, thank you.  Even across countries, there are countries in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

the world that have more gun ownership than occurs in the 

United States, you have Switzerland, for example, you have—

which has one of the lowest—  

PAUL HELMKE 

[UNCLEAR] self-defense—   

JOHN LOTT 

—traditionally one of the lowest murder rates in Europe.  You 

have Israel, which probably has the highest gun possession rate 

in the world and yet, traditionally has one of the lowest murder 

rates in the world.  There are lots of things that affect crime rates 

across places.  If you look in the United States, 50 percent of the 

counties in the United States have zero murders in any given 

year.  25 percent of the counties have one murder.  Over 70 

percent of the murders in the United States are concentrated in 

just over 3 percent of the counties, those counties represent over 

20 percent of the population but they get over 70 percent of the 

murders.   And yet if you look across it, it’s the counties without 

any murders that have by far the highest gun ownership rates, 

it’s the, it’s the few percent that have 70 percent where you have 

by far the lowest gun ownership rates.   So, I mean there are lots 

of things that are going on there, there are drug gangs that I 

think populate these high-crime urban areas that’s a real 

problem.  And one can go and talk about the problems there, 

that’ll be a different subject to go into.  And—

JOHN DONVAN  

All right, John, I’m going to stop you there because of a time 

issue.  I want to point out where we at this point, we’ve wrapped 

up the, the head-to-head section, and we are at the point, 

approaching the point where we need all of you to make the 

decision that decides, how this evening ends.  Let’s— to remind 

you when you came in and we polled you on the motion, “Guns 

reduce crime,” 13 percent of you agreed, 60 percent of you 

disagreed.   And 27 percent were undecided, we have heard the 

bulk of the arguments and the back-and-forth.  But now we’re 

going to allow each panelist to sum up his position with a two-

minute statement, beginning with the Seattle Chief of Police, Gil 

Kerlikowske.  Chief?   

R. GIL KERLIKOWSKE 

Sure, I want to restate in the second sentence when I did my 

seven minutes, I said there is no debate about people’s right to 

own and possess guns.  It is what the Supreme Court has defined 

as the reasonableness issue.  John Lott told you that, well, 

people with concealed firearms rarely commit murders.  Guess 

what, people that go through some type of check and go through 

a police department to get their concealed firearms permit, don’t 

go out and commit a lot of crimes.  But, he also used the same 

argument that, well, let me tell you that people wouldn’t make 

the newspaper if you threaten somebody with a gun who was 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 75. 

 

 

 

trying to rob you and it went off and it wouldn’t even be reported.   

I can tell you that people with concealed firearms permits drive 

drunk—with a gun in their holster in their car.  People with 

concealed firearms permits in which we sent a clerk home 

because she issued one on a Monday, and on Friday when she 

was filing saw that the person had, after getting the permit 

committed suicide with a gun within the same week.   And one of 

our young women officers who talked a drunken women out of a 

gun who was holding it to her head and her face and in her lap, 

and finally was able to wrestle it away, had just gotten her 

concealed firearms permits.   None of those cases made the 

newspapers, so there are plenty of cases out there, as an 

example.  I think reasonableness should enter into this, it should 

be more than just being upright and not being blind to allow you 

to carry a gun.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Chief Kerlikowske, Seattle Chief of Police speaking 

against the motion.  Speaking for the motion in his summarizing 

statement, John Lott, senior research scholar at the University of 

Maryland.    

JOHN LOTT 

Thank you all again very much for inviting us here, it’s a great 

pleasure to be here.  You know, there are a lots of things that 

affect crime.  I think—as I said before I think police are the single 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

most important factor.  But we can deal with numbers on a lot of 

these things, we have anecdotal stories, the police chief just went 

through some.   I advise you, you can go and check these things 

out.  The Florida department of—of issuing these concealed 

handgun permits has detailed records, you can go to their 

website.  The Texas Department of Public Safety, if you just 

Google Texas Department of Public Safety, concealed handguns, 

they’ll go through year by year, and tell you how many permit-

holders have been convicted for driving under the influence of 

alcohol.   And you’ll—it’s an incredibly tiny number, that this 

happens.  I’m not saying it’s zero.  But the rate at which people 

lose their permits for any type of firearms-related violation, he 

gave examples of that, you look, state after state, it’s hundreds or 

thousands of one percentage point.   Off-duty police officers in 

Florida, were arrested and convicted at higher rates by about four 

times greater than concealed-carry permit holders were arrested 

in Florida during the same period of time.  And I want to respond 

to John Donohue’s comments about D.C.   It’s not true whether 

you look at rates or you look at numbers that you’re going to see 

the murder rates fall or robbery rates fall after D.C.’s handgun 

ban.  It goes up in either case.  It just goes up more with the rate, 

and with—when he says it falls what happens is, when you’re 

just looking at the numbers, the numbers are falling quickly 

before the ban, and rising relatively slowly after,  and what he 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 77. 

 

 

 

does is compare the before average, and the after average, and 

that makes it look like the before average is higher than the after 

average, so it looks like, well, it’s fallen, but it’s just the average, 

if you look at year by year, you use it’s falling slowly and then 

rising faster afterwards.   There’s no way you can break down 

these numbers, and not see that D.C., Chicago, England, 

Jamaica, Ireland, other countries which have banned guns have 

not seen increases in violent crime rates afterwards.   And D.C. 

just didn’t rise relative to what it was before, it went from being 

15th [REPEATING WARNING TONE] to one or two in the country.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, John Lott.  Summarizing his position against the 

motion, John Donohue, economist and professor of law at Yale.

Again, the D.C. case is a case of a city that was massively 

depopulating with its most affluent citizens leaving at the time.  

Steve Levitt, the author of Freakanomics, is a John Bates Clark 

Award winner, sometimes described as the junior Nobel Prize in 

economics.   He dismissed John Lott’s more guns, less crime 

theory in his books and writing, when other scholars tried to look 

at this work they found that right-to-carry laws simply don’t 

bring down the rate of crime.   We have heard the discussion in 

the United States.  There are many features of the United States 

that would suggest we’d have one of the lowest rates of violent

crime, rich countries in general have low rates of violent crime, 

we’re the richest.   We have more people in prison than any other 

country in, in world history.  In fact no European country has 

even half the level of incarceration rate that we have.  Yet, our 

crime rate is phenomenally high and you hear, the proposition is 

that more guns would reduce crime,  we have 42 percent of the 

world’s guns in civilian hands in the United States, how many 

more would we need to get down to the level of crime of our 

European allies, they mentioned Switzerland and Israel, again 

these are completely inapposite.   Switzerland has a regime in 

which individuals are in a militia, they take home an assault 

weapon, and they are given a locked container of ammunition 

that they’re not allowed to open up, they have to repeatedly come 

to headquarters and show that they haven’t opened it up and if 

they have they’re put in jail.   In Israel, they do put you in jail if 

you lose your gun.  This is the problem.  They keep ignoring the 

fact that millions, or between 500,000 and a million of guns are 

stolen every year, that means a gun in a criminal’s hands, even if 

it’s keeping you epsilon safer by having a gun, when your gun 

gets turned over to a criminal, that’s making everybody else more 

unsafe.   So it doesn’t matter what happens to the right-to-carry 

holder, and what he did, [REPEATING WARNING TONE] it 

matters what happens to the gun that he got, that then got used 

by a criminal to kill someone else.

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, John Donahue.  Summing up his position for the 

motion, “Guns reduce crime,” Stephen Halbrook, attorney 

representing the NRA in several lawsuits.   

STEPHEN HALBROOK 

Thank you, John, I want to respond to two things that Professor 

Donohue has stated in the Heller case the Supreme Court 

decided that the Second Amendment guarantees the individual 

right of, of individual citizens to keep and bear arms including 

handguns.   That’s the position that the NRA has taken, for 

many, many decades through— of its history since 1871.  And 

Mr. Donohue said that the NRA does not tell the truth on the 

Second Amendment.   Well, then the Supreme Court doesn’t 

either because that’s what the Supreme Court held in the Heller 

case.  If you walk out back and you go to the bookstand here at 

this auditorium you’ll see a book called The Founders’ Second 

Amendment, which I authored-- it’s a new book on the history of 

the Second Amendment and you’ll see, basically agreement with 

what the Supreme Court held, that it is an individual right, that 

the NRA did not make it up.  In addition, I’ve been to Switzerland 

many times and participated in shooting matches with military 

rifles.   And you can buy all the ammunition you want at the 

shooting ranges and at gun shops.  You’re issued a tin of 

ammunition that you’re not allowed to open because they want it

to be available if the militia army has to be mobilized, but there’s 

no restriction on your ammunition usage or purchases, so it’s—

every Swiss male when he enters age 20 is issued a military 

assault rifle and he keeps it at home.  And there’s an extremely 

low crime rate in Switzerland.  A remaining thought I would like 

to say in favor of the proposition, is, I would like everybody to 

kind of think about yourself.  You’ve heard here tonight, that 

we’re all potential murderers, that if we get angry if we have a 

gun we’re gonna kill somebody.   It’s just not true, most people 

with these concealed-weapon permits, are just like you and me, 

they’re normal people, they don’t just suddenly get angry or, or 

have a couple glasses of wine and, and go on murderous sprees.  

We’re not like that, most Americans are good people—they can be 

trusted with guns, and they should be trained.   Children should 

be trained in gun safety but to somehow act like [REPEATING 

WARNING TONE]…we’re all potential criminals is just, completely 

beyond the pale.    

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Stephen Halbrook.  Summing up his position against 

the motion, “Guns reduce crime,” Paul Helmke, president of the 

Brady Campaign and Brady Center to Reduce Gun Violence.   

PAUL HELMKE 

Again I want to thank all of our listeners tonight, the question 

you have to ask yourself is, did the other side prove its case, did 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 81. 

 

 

 

they prove that guns reduce crime.  You haven’t really heard any 

evidence that shows that it did.  And I think the question you 

should ask yourself to just get a gut-check on this is, when 

you’re at the next sporting event,  or when you’re sitting in the 

restaurant, would you feel safer thinking that everyone had a 

gun, or that no one had a gun.  [LAUGHTER]  The reason that 

you react that way, is because you know instinctively that we 

make it too easy for dangerous people and people that don’t know 

the responsibilities that go with guns to get guns.  I ask the 

question, why aren’t we the safest country in the world if we’ve 

got so many guns.   It’s because we make it too easy, we don’t 

know where those guns are, we don’t know who has the guns.  

And if you have a gun, and again I’m not anti-gun and if you 

want a gun and understand the responsibilities, fine.   But there 

are responsibilities that go with it, the Supreme Court made it 

clear there are restrictions that go with it.  Where do the guns 

come from that the bad guys, that the gang members get.  They 

steal them from people like you.  They steal them from gun stores 

who lose their—quote, “lose” 30,000 guns every year.   They get 

them through straw purchase.  There are no limits on the 

number of guns you can buy at one time, there are very few 

limits on the type of guns you can buy.  In most places in this 

country there really are no laws…very few laws, restricting who 

gets guns.  We make it too easy for dangerous people to get guns.

The way to reduce crime is to do things like background checks.  

Fight the illegal trafficking in guns.  Say that some guns should 

not be in the hands of the civilian population.   Those are things 

that can help take down the crime rates in our communities, not 

flooding our communities with more guns.  Thank you very 

much.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Paul Helmke.  [APPLAUSE]  And our final speaker, as 

we approach the moment of truth…speaking for the motion, 

“Guns reduce crime,” Gary Kleck, professor of criminology and 

criminal justice at Florida State.   

GARY KLECK 

You may remember I started out my opening remarks by saying  

you sometimes need to listen for the silences, and I think the 

panelists on the other side demonstrated that because they didn’t 

in fact address the evidence that we presented…Paul Helmke 

insists we didn’t present any evidence, we cited some of the most 

thoroughly vetted scientific evidence we have on the question.     

Study after study repeatedly showed the same thing, it showed 

defensive gun use as common, it showed defensive gun use as 

effective.  It shows that after we pass these shall-issue carry laws 

and make it easy to, to get a carry permit, crime does not go up…   

It’s also a sign of a weakness, of a particular position when 

people have to misstate what the issue is, remember the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Guns Reduce Crime” (10/28/08) Page 83. 

 

 

 

proposition was that guns reduce crime, okay, do they make you 

safer to have a gun…well, we didn’t really hear anything about 

that.   Instead we hear Paul Helmke saying would you feel 

comfortable with everybody having a gun, well of course that’s 

not the issue, nobody here proposed that because of course 

“everybody” includes lunatics, convicted murderers, robbers, 

rapists and so on.   It’s not the proposition, and in fact no one 

here even secretly thinks that we ought to do that, it’s not an 

issue, so why not confront the issue, do guns reduce crime.   

Well, in fact guns in the hands of non-criminals, guns in the 

hands of crime victims, do make them safer.  So what does this 

imply for policy, well, the implication for policy is, let’s do what 

we can to keep guns away from criminals, but that should not 

include taking them away from non-criminals who would use 

them to save their lives, to prevent the completion of rapes and 

robberies, to prevent injuries, and to prevent the loss of property, 

we should instead do what common-sensically most of America 

has been doing for decades which is moderate controls aimed at 

preventing criminals [REPEATING WARNING TONE] from getting 

guns but without denying them to non-criminals.   

JOHN DONVAN  

That was Gary Kleck, thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  And now we are 

at the moment of truth, you can turn once again to the keypads 

by your seats and we want you to vote on our motion, “Guns

reduce crime.”  Press “1” if you support the motion, press 

number “2” if you are against, press number “3” if you are 

undecided,  it will take us about 90 seconds to tabulate the 

results, in the meantime I want to point out what’s coming up 

next.  On Tuesday, November 18th, the motion of our debate will 

be, “Google Violates Its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto.”  Panelists for the 

motion include Harry Lewis, a professor of computer science at 

Harvard, Randall Picker, a professor of commercial law at the 

University of Chicago Law School, and Siva Vaidhyanathan who 

is professor of media studies and law at the University of Virginia.   

Against the motion, we have John Batelle who is founder, 

chairman and CEO of Federated Media Publishing, Esther Dyson, 

an investor in information technology companies, and Jeff Jarvis, 

director of the interactive journalism program at the City 

University of New York.  These debates as we’ve made clear 

several times can be heard on more than 150 NPR stations 

across the country.   So just check your local NPR station for the 

date and times of the broadcast.  The results are coming 

down…as I point out the copies of books and DVD’s, books by all 

of these people are on sale in the lobby…  [LAUGHTER]  And they 

are very willing to sell and sign.   And finally a reminder that our 

debate on December 2nd, “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the 

Last 50 Years”…  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  which was not meant 

to be an applause line—  [LAUGHTER]  will be recorded for

broadcast on BBC World News Television and to accommodate 

that taping for that broadcast, we will be moving the debate to 

the Symphony Space.   That’s at 95th and Broadway, and for 

more information, please visit our website, and now, the results…  

[PAUSE]  Hmm.  Before the debate, 13 percent were for the 

motion, 60 percent were against, and 27 percent were undecided.  

After the debate, there was movement on all fronts but it looks as 

though the motion—  the side for the motion moved more of you.   

27 percent agree with the motion that guns reduce crime, 64 

percent of you disagree, and now only 10 percent of you are 

undecided.  So, it was a close, a close call, with a little bit of an 

edge to those for the motion in terms of moving and changing 

minds.  Congratulations to all of our panelists.   

[APPLAUSE]
