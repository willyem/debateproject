CHRIS BURY 

And to begin the program, I would like to introduce Robert 

Rosenkranz, chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation, the 

sponsor of this evening’s debate.  [APPLAUSE]    

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Well, thank you for that polite applause.  [LAUGHTER]  It’s really 

my pleasure and honor to, uh, to welcome you all tonight, this is 

the seventh debate in our inaugural series of public policy 

debates, “Intelligence Squared,” I’m the chairman of Intelligence 

Squared, which is an initiative of the Rosenkranz Foundation.   

Uh, as Chris said, these proceedings are, uh, produced for radio 

by WNYC, and broadcast nationally through NPR.  We’re also 

thankful to our sponsor, the Times of London.  Well, to what 

extent should we trade privacy for security?  Our society’s one 

that values civil liberty so highly that in the words of Justice 

Cardozo, um…if a constable blunders, the criminal goes free.  

But what is that saying, it’s that the need to incentivize the 

constable to follow the rules is more important to our society 

than justice for the individual criminal, or compassion for his 

victim.   Um…but, we also value security a great deal also.  Uh,

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 2. 

 

 

 

9/11 presented an unprecedented type of threat.  It’s clear that 

there are terrorists out there who will inflict the, the… deadliest 

kind of means at their disposal, to, to create grievous harm for 

civilians here.  And, uh, the traditional legal framework of dealing 

with soldiers or dealing with criminals, uh, was never created 

with that kind of threat in mind.  So it’s, it’s sort of self-evident, 

uh, that the lines that were drawn prior to 9/11 must be drawn 

differently.  But the question is how differently.  And one would 

expect a lively national debate on an issue of this kind of 

importance, it’s very timely.  Um…  In the news recently has been 

scrutiny of international banking transactions.  Uh, wiretaps 

without warrants.   Just in the last week or so, there’ve been 

proposed renewal and revisions of, of FISA, the Fed— Foreign 

Intelligence, uh, Surveillance Act.   But the debate on these kinds 

of issues has been somewhat clouded by a, a,…general 

skepticism I would say of the Bush administration both in terms 

of its competence and judgment.  And, uh, our hope tonight is 

really to transcend, uh, partisan bickering, transcend ideology, 

because getting the trade-off between privacy and security right, 

demands reasoned discourse.  And our lives may depend upon it.   

So, uh, it’s now my real pleasure to turn the evening over to the 

stellar panelists that, uh, uh, that Dana Wolfe our executive 

producer has put together this evening.  Our moderator is Chris 

Bury, who’s known to you all from ABC News “Nightline.”   He’s

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 3. 

 

 

 

reported extensively on national politics and policy issues 

including the intelligence community.  He anchored “Nightline” 

from Afghanistan, from CENTCOM war headquarters, and in a 

network first, from the Fort Meade headquarters of the National 

Security Agency.  He’s earned five Emmy Awards for his work on 

“Nightline,” received Columbia University DuPont honors for his 

reporting on “World News Tonight,” so I’m pleased to add the 

au—hand the evening over to Chris Bury.    

CHRIS BURY  

Thank you, Bob, for that kind introduction.  [APPLAUSE]  And I’d 

like to thank you as well for your considerable efforts to raise the 

substance, elevate the substance and the tone of public 

conversation on, on matters of public policy, we’re all grateful for 

that, thank you.   Now I would like to welcome you officially to 

the seventh Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I’ll give you a brief 

rundown of how things are gonna go this evening.  First the 

proposers of the motion will start by presenting their side of the 

argument, “Better more domestic surveillance than another 

9/11.”   The opposition will follow.  Each person will get a 

maximum of eight minutes, and we’ll go back and forth between 

the two sides.  Each speaker will get a notice from me with one 

minute to go.   And debaters, when you get that one-minute 

warning it really is time to wrap things up, because when your 

time has come, it is my job to cut you off with all the mercy of

Robespierre at the guillotine.  [LAUGHTER]   Not to be rude but 

because this is a radio broadcast and we’re gonna try to keep the 

trains, uh, running on time here.  Second, when all speakers are 

finished with their opening remarks, I’m gonna follow up and try 

to get you going with some civil exchange.   And then we’re gonna 

open up the floor to the audience, and for audience members, uh, 

we’d ask you to keep your questions short and, uh, to the point, 

you may wanna direct them at an individual panelist or you may 

want to direct them at one particular side of, of the argument.  

We ask that you refrain from giving speeches, we just don’t have 

the time.  After the Q-and-A, each debater will make a final 

statement, lasting not longer than two minutes.  And after the 

final closing argument you will vote on tonight’s motion, with the 

keypad which is attached to the arm-rest of your seat.  Finally I 

will announce the results of the audience vote, and tell you which 

of these sides has carried the day.   For those of you who have 

attended previous debates, you probably had one of those little 

cards, and let me see if I, if I have one here, you’re probably used 

to this.  Um, tonight we’re gonna try something new, and, uh, 

vote with an electronic system.  And, uh, I think Diebold made it 

so there shouldn’t be any problem at all…  [LAUGHTER]   But we 

will ask for your patience because, uh, this is a virgin attempt at 

this electronic system.  And so, uh, let’s find a—here we go, the—

it looks like a little calculator, does everybody have… located this, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

it should be on the side of your… arm-rest, so, see if you can find 

these…  All right, everybody have ‘em?  So before we hear the 

arguments from our panelists, let’s see how you feel on the 

question right now.   So pick up the keypad…and after my 

prompt, you will press 1 if you are for the motion, “Better more 

surveillance than another 9/11,” press 2 if you are against that 

motion, and press 3 if you’re undecided.  And you may begin 

voting now.  [PAUSE]   Everybody got that, 1 if you’re for, 2 

against, and 3 undecided.  [PAUSE]  And I don’t see any panic 

from the control room so we’re hoping that…it—it’s going to work.   

Let me introduce our distinguished panel of guests tonight.  For 

the motion, on my far right, spatially speaking, only, author…  

columnist for National Review Online and resident fellow at the 

American Enterprise Institute, David Frum.  [APPLAUSE]

for him, sometimes, former Congressman, occupant of the 21st 

Century Liberties Chair for Freedom and Privacy at the American 

Conservative Union, columnist and radio show host, the 

honorable Bob Barr.  [APPLAUSE]   To Mr. Barr’s left, author,

York Law School, and president of the American Civil Liberties 

Union, Nadine Strossen.  [APPLAUSE]  So let’s start the debate 

and arguing for the opposition, David Frum, please take the 

podium—   

DAVID FRUM 

Thank you.  Thank you, thank you all, and thank you to the 

Rosenkranz Foundation for their important work in…making civil 

conversation really a reality in which we can all participate.  Like 

to tell you a little story to begin.   Uh, about two months after I 

started work at the White House in two—2001, there was a rap 

on the door, not a midnight rap, a daytime rap.  Uh, my wife, um, 

went to answer the door, um, and there on the step was an agent 

of the FBI.   Uh, showed her his badge, and asked if he might 

come in and ask a few questions.  Our neigh—next-door 

neighbor, he told her, had just, uh, been hired into a sensitive 

position in the federal government, and as part of the security 

check on the next-door neighbor he wanted to ask a few 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 7. 

 

 

 

questions.  So he asked my wife, uh, had we noticed anything 

unusual about them, did they seem to be living within their 

means, uh, did they, uh, conduct themselves responsibly and 

respectably in the neighborhood and—  She was a little 

embarrassed because these were new neighbors, we did not know 

them well but to the best of her ability she gave ‘em a clean bill of 

health.  But jogged by this, she said, you know, we haven’t had 

them over, we really should.  So—  [LAUGHTER]   So she invited 

the next-door neighbors over a few weeks later and they came 

and we poured tea and gave them cake and eventually my wife 

congratulated, um, them on, on the husband’s new job with the 

federal government.   He said, what are you talking about, he 

said I’m—I’m still at Sibley and Austin, I’ve always been at Sibley 

and Austin.  And what we realized, was, that the FBI had meant 

to come to their house…  [LAUGHTER]  to ask them about me.  

[LAUGHTER]   Tonight’s motion, is “Better—better more domestic 

surveillance than another 9/11,” and the question is, more than 

what?  And my answer is, more than that.  [LAUGHTER]   Now, 

none of us are here to argue, none of us are here to argue for 

limitless domestic surveillance.  Um, the three of us on the 

affirmative side of this debate have a deep and abiding 

commitment to privacy and liberty.   Um, my colleague, Andy 

McCarthy, has been a federal prosecutor, his job is to defend and 

uphold the US Constitution, the greatest liberty-affirming 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 8. 

 

 

 

document in world history.  My colleague John Yoo, was on the 

front line to defend all—all of our liberties, and liberties of people 

all over the world, against, uh, totalitarian conspiracy.   Not only 

that but in our private lives, Andy McCarthy is a conservative in 

New York, and John Yoo is a conservative at Berkeley, California.  

[LAUGHTER]  We understand, believe me, in the most intimate 

possible way, the importance of free thought, free expression, 

privacy, and the ability of human beings to speak their mind in 

debate and conversation, without fear of punishment or 

consequence or an overbearing state.  But…here’s the question 

for today.  Should we have more surveillance than we had when 

those FBI agents were knocking on the wrong door…at, uh, a 

level of surveillance that made possible the tremendous 

catastrophe we know as 9/11, or should we continue with the 

path we’ve been following since 9/11, toward, not a police state, 

not a nightmare regime in which you have no privacy.   Is anyone 

in this room as a concrete matter afraid to speak his or her 

mind?  I very much doubt it.  But, um…  [LAUGHTER]  That’s 

just because your listeners are so cranky.  [LAUGHTER]  Uh…we, 

we are here—  Uh, we are here to uphold…a new level of 

surveillance, that is, uh, that is not made up of new techniques, 

it is made up of very familiar and traditional techniques, as my 

partners will argue, that is not onerous, that is not burdensome, 

that leaves all legitimate freedoms and privacies intact, and that

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 9. 

 

 

 

is abundantly worth it, and in fact has proven over the past half-

decade, has proven in the acid test of experience its merit.   You 

know, 9/11 is beginning to be a little while ago.  But the recent 

terrible events of—at Virginia Tech, um, Technical institute—the, 

the Virginia Tech University, remind us, remind us of the reality 

of danger and fear, uh, of—that we all experienced in those 

terrible days.   Now if we cast our minds back, back to that time, 

I think many of us will remember, we expected more of the same.  

We dreaded more of the same.  And that was one of the reasons 

that, uh, the—the sniper attacks in Washington were able to 

paralyze a great city.   Because we were ready for something 

dreadful, something even more dreadful.  And on American soil, 

it has not happened.  But that does not mean that the threat is 

not real, in fact, if you sound the roll of world events since 9/11, 

you will be reminded how very, very real it is.  In December of 

2001, gunmen attacked the Indian parliament, and, uh, 

attempted— well, hoped, hoped to kill in fact very senior officials 

in the Indian government.   They did kill a number of 

parliamentarians and some ci—uh, civil servants, and some 

security guards, and very nearly succeeded in triggering a 

nuclear war, between India and Pakistan.   We remember the 

bombing in Bali, uh, whi—which took so many lives of, uh, 

Indonesians and Australians, and others who were, who were 

visiting that, that beautiful place.  The Madrid Atocha railway

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 10. 

 

 

 

station bombings.  The bombings in London in 2005.   Just this 

past year in 2006, attempted bombings, very serious attempted 

bombings, in Toronto, and in Germany, and tragically a 

successful bombing in Bombay, successful of course from the 

point of view of the terrorists.   These—the, the threat, the threat 

of mass-casualty terrorism, um, at the hands of people guided by 

a totalitarian ideology, remains a real threat.  But here’s the good 

news.  What we notice as we look back on this half-decade of 

terrible atrocities, is a dwindling level of sophistication, behind 

each of these attacks.   Uh, that the Atocha attack was much less 

sophisticated than the 9/11 attack, the London attack in 2005, 

less sophisticated than Atocha, and the attacks attempted this 

past summer were less sophisticated than those of 2005.   The 

terrorists are finding it harder to coordinate, they’re finding it 

harder to communicate with each other, they are under crushing 

international pressure.  Now…one of the ironies about this is, we 

don’t…entirely understand how this is happening, even inside 

our own law enforcement agencies.   Here’s one way to think 

about how a terrorist attack proceeds.  If any—if any of you have 

been in a toy store recently I’m sure you’ve seen those toys, 

where you drop a ball bearing, uh, through, uh, into a little slot 

and it whizzes and rolls and it catches the little teeter-totter and 

it goes through a basketball hoop, and it proceeds over many, uh, 

feet of track until finally it emerges out the other end.   And there 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 11. 

 

 

 

are a series all along the way of little switching points, and that’s 

the game, to watch the ball jump and hop and skip and move 

past these various obstacles.  Think of a terrorist plot as like that 

ball bearing.  It starts, and it rolls and it unfurls.  And it has to 

pass—   

CHRIS BURY 

One.    

DAVID FRUM 

—pass through a number of switching points.  If you can make 

each of those points just slightly more difficult, you stop the plot 

in just the way the earth’s atmosphere stops the meteorites, 

without any of us ever being aware of it.   It is that level of in—of 

in—of intensified surveillance of illegitimate activities, that has 

complicated the life of the terrorist, not—and has not made 

terrorism impossible, has not in any way lessened their desire to 

do people harm, but that has made—that has broken up their 

ability to communicate with one another, that has made it more 

difficult for them to move money, and has made it much more 

difficult to strike, and especially to strike inside the United 

States.   You know, all of us here, are people—are, um, are 

people who love liberty.  Who prize liberty, and who use liberty, 

as we are using it tonight.  But we are also citizens of great cities 

in the Western world.   And we are all potential casualties of 

attack.  And the liberties we are using are the very thing, the very 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 12. 

 

 

 

thing that inflames and provokes those who would attack us.   

CHRIS BURY  

David Frum—   

DAVID FRUM 

We are here—   

CHRIS BURY 

—thank you very much—   

DAVID FRUM 

—to defend that liberty, by defending the higher level of 

surveillance seen since 9/11.  Thank you—    

CHRIS BURY  

Thank you, David.  [APPLAUSE]  And arguing against the motion, 

Bob Barr.    

BOB BARR 

I promise…not to use the example that David gave us, of how 

easy it is for the FBI to screw up something as simple…as 

interviewing the right person for a federal job, security 

clearance…  [APPLAUSE]  as, as clear an example of why we 

should not entrust yet additional secret surveillance powers to 

the government, I promise not to make such an example.  

[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]   Better more domestic surveillance 

than another 9/11?  I don’t know how to put it quite delicately 

enough, and not just no but hell no.  The government doesn’t 

need it…the government has shown it doesn’t deserve it...the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 13. 

 

 

 

government has not justified it, the government will abuse 

additional domestic surveillance power, as sure as we are sitting 

here this evening.   And the people of this great land, and those 

who lawfully visit this country as well, cannot afford it.  Now why 

can’t we afford it.   Many of us here, many of you all may be here 

this evening, because you have a particular privacy concern.  A 

particular category of information, that you believe ought to be, 

or, continue to be, private, from government snooping.  From 

government surveillance.   Or, you may not have a particular 

category of such information yourself, but others might, and you 

support them, in maintaining the secrecy, the privacy, the 

privilege, of maintaining that information for themselves.  But I 

suspect that deep down, at least most of us are here this evening, 

because we understand that privacy is more than simply the sum 

total of individual aspects of information that we wanna retain 

private.   Ayn Rand, that great philosopher, who just two years 

ago I believe it was we celebrated centennial of her birth…and 

that great proponent of freedom, put it perhaps best, when she 

wrote, in 1943, in the middle of World War II, in The 

Fountainhead, that “privacy is the essence of civilization itself.  

Yes, it is that important.   Civilization is the march of 

mankind…toward a realization and an acceptance of and a 

protection of, the basic right to privacy.”  I think our founding 

fathers understood that, when they crafted the Bill of Rights.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 14. 

 

 

 

They didn’t feel the need to mention, in each one of those, this is 

a privacy right.  But just look at them, and you see the 

importance of privacy, embodied in… the foundation of the First 

Amendment.  Were it not based on a notion that we have a right 

to the privacy, of our religious, political views for example, there’d 

be no reason to have the First Amendment.   The Second 

Amendment…so much in the news these days, also is founded in 

essence on the notion of privacy.  If we, as preachers of God, did 

not enjoy the inherent right to the privacy of our being, of our 

property, then there would be no reason to have a Second 

Amendment which is designed to implement the protection of 

those ideas, those properties, those persons.   The right to the 

privacy, the right to have your ideas, your privacy, your property, 

your person free from unwarranted government intrusion is 

indeed the essence of civilization.  That’s why it’s so important 

that we address this issue.   The question, “Better more domestic 

surveillance than another 9/11”…look at what we’re talking 

about here, we’re not talking about the legitimate function of 

government in a national security context…to gather intelligence 

on foreigners, foreign intelligence.   What we’re talking about is 

our government surveilling us.  And they ought to be held, and 

the Fourth Amendment requires them to be held, to a very high 

burden.  Why?  Because our founding fathers recognized…that if 

we allowed the government to intrude into our lives, other than in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 15. 

 

 

 

those areas where it has an articulable, legitimate need to pierce 

that sphere of privacy that surrounds each one of us, if we allow 

that, then we are not free.   Think back.  This question also talks 

about another 9/11.  Fear, of course the driving force for virtually 

every effort by the federal government and indeed by state and 

local governments, since 9/11, to justify whatever expanded 

government power it is that they seek.   We’re talking about 

another 9/11.  Well, let’s think about 9/11.  Did 9/11 happen, 

did those awful… terrorists succeed on 9/11 in this very city, and 

in our nation’s capital, and in that field in Pennsylvania, did they 

succeed because the government was not able to increase its 

surveillance of…those of us in this country, no.   Those terrorists 

succeeded because of a series of tragic… mistakes and blunders 

by government.  Our government didn’t use the tools that were 

already available to it.   It could’ve stopped those terrorists at any 

number of points along their horrible journey.  There were laws, 

repetitive laws, on the books, at the federal and the state level, to 

have stopped them from gaining access to the information that 

they needed.   From gaining access to—access to the tools 

whereby car—they carried out…their horrible deeds.  It wasn’t 

because the government lacked…sufficient power to surveil 

Americans.  It is a false premise.   And what has the government 

done since then, and what is it even doing now.  I guarantee you, 

if this question, “Better more domestic surveillance than another 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 16. 

 

 

 

9/11,” is answered by the American people, not just here this 

evening, but writ large…then you will never, ever see the end of 

government surveillance power.   Sort of like being a divorce 

lawyer, something I do not do.  No matter how much you concede 

to the other side—   

CHRIS BURY 

One.   

BOB BARR 

—they always want more.   

CHRIS BURY 

One.   

BOB BARR 

So it is with domestic surveillance.  Even today, this 

administration, which has violated the laws limiting…its ability to 

conduct domestic surveillance, it wishes and is seeking 

legislation to gain even more access to our private lives, and, get 

this.  The final irony.  To grant immunity for past violations of the 

law.  Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11, not 

on your life.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]    

CHRIS BURY  

Bob Barr, thank you.  For the motion, Andrew McCarthy.    

Andrew McCarthy: 

Thank you very much.  Um, pleasure to be here this evening.  

My, uh, FBI story is a little bit different from David’s.  It’s more 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 17. 

 

 

 

along the lines of what the FBI was up against.  My brother, who 

lived in the Bronx, was applying for a job with the FBI, uh, and 

the knock we got on the door was from one of the neighbors who 

told him that the Feds had been by, but not to worry – he didn’t 

tell ‘em nothing.  [LAUGHTER]  Um, that, of course, was back in 

the 1990s, uh, before there ever was a, uh, George W. Bush 

Administration to bash.  Uh, and during that time the United 

States managed to stop exactly one terrorist attack by something 

other than dumb luck.  That was the spring 1993 Jihadist 

conspiracy against New York City landmarks, right here in 

Manhattan.  How did we stop it?  The FBI had a confidential 

informant who infiltrated the conspiracy.  Now, think for a 

moment about how intrusive that is.  Our government sent a 

man right out into radical mosques to meet with worshipers.   

 

All of them were Muslims.  Several of them were American 

citizens.  He prayed among them, he entered their very homes, he 

tape recorded all of his conversations.  And following the 

government’s instructions, he lied to them about who he was and 

who he was working for.  And he did that precisely to trick them, 

uh, in order to get them to compromise their most deeply held 

secrets and plans.  And you know what?  Neither the Fifth 

Amendment nor the Fourth Amendment had a thing to say about 

it.  It’s been the law of the United States for decades that such 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 18. 

 

 

 

investigative techniques do not implicate our privacy and due 

process interests.  Um, as a result of that there were no court 

orders for those tactics, no judicial supervision, uh, no 

supervision of any kind for the most intrusive tactics imaginable.   

 

And had those tactics not been used, thousands of New Yorkers 

would have lost their lives in those attacks.  That’s not me 

conjuring up a nightmare scenario.  That’s not me trying to tap 

into your fear.  That’s a case that actually happened, right down 

here in Manhattan.  Uh, it’s the kind of investigating that didn’t 

happen before 9/11, when nearly three thousand people were 

killed, and didn’t happen in connection with most of the 

completed atrocities that were the subjects of the trials that took 

place in the 1990s.  And the Executive Branch, without judicial 

supervision and without much Congressional oversight to speak 

of, has intercepted and electronically eavesdropped on enemy 

communications in every war in the history of the United States 

since it’s been technologically possible to do so.   

 

It’s a simple fact.  You cannot get good actionable intelligence, 

the intelligence that saves lives, without monitoring what people 

are saying to each other and without watching the bad guys to 

see who they speak to so that you can map out these 

organizations.  That’s just common sense.  The most dangerous

conspirators are generally speaking the most insulated 

conspirators.  It takes wiretapping to ferret them out.  In the 

1930s, uh, the government got Al Capone on tax evasion.  That’s 

all they could come up with.  Uh, but in the 1990s the 

government got John Gotti on about twenty-five homicides.  How 

did they do it?  They listened to what he was saying.  They 

bugged his conversations.  Today, of course, we’re not talking 

about Mafia hits.  We’re talking about mass murders of our 

citizens – not just law enforcement but national security.  All of 

our liberties are precious.  On that, uh, I think every panelist 

here is in agreement, as David said before.   

 

But none of our liberties is worthy of the name unless we can 

secure the country.  And all our liberties are valuable but none of 

them is as valuable as the collective right to life that belongs to 

all of us collectively together in our national community.  To 

protect that right we have to do surveillance.  We’re fighting an 

enemy that does not have a territory to defend.  It does not have 

a treasure that we can destroy them by taking.  Our only, only 

defense is surveillance – finding out who they are, trying to figure 

out what they might strike next.  And stopping them is far more 

important than prosecuting them.  Prosecutions become cold 

comfort when the death tolls start to climb into the hundreds and 

the thousands.  And we’ve seen that.  That’s not a scare tactic.

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 20. 

 

 

 

Against such daunting risks privacy interests fretted over by our 

friends on the other side are frankly trifles.   

 

What difference does it make if the government has information 

that your phone company, your bank and every private, uh, 

vendor that you deal with, uh, not only has but is warehousing 

and data mining, targeting you.  Uh, but unlike the government, 

not targeting you so that they can protect you.  The government’s 

ability to access such information may make the difference 

between life and death.  And in the national security context, that 

access is now subject to various judicial hurdles and 

Congressional oversight, which our law has never imposed on 

prosecutors and agents who investigate such insignificant, 

relatively speaking, crimes as gambling.  Common sense tells us 

that under the current threat this is the kind of investigating that 

government not only should be able to do but must be able to do.   

 

If you don’t think so, ask yourself about the security you willingly 

subjected yourself to without any court search warrant the last 

time you got on a plane or entered a public building or tried to 

carry a bag into Yankee Stadium or even if you’ve had the 

experience of entering the offices of the American Civil Liberties 

Union.  We had a trial here in New York about a year ago and it 

came out during the trial that visitors to the ACLU’s New York

office, uh, are confronted when they come in with big signs on the 

wall that say, “Your bags are subject to search.”   Why do they do 

that?  It’s a reasonable balancing of our minor, of minor 

intrusions to protect ourselves and the people we care about.  

That’s what the Fourth Amendment has always been about – 

reasonableness.  If there’s a valid basis to believe people could be 

drinking and driving the police can set up sobriety checks and 

stop motorists randomly.  When the police arrest somebody, 

they’ve always had the ability, uh, to search them to make sure 

that they’re not armed.   

 

If you work in a regulated industry the government can compel 

you to provide information and even do spot checks.  None of this 

requires a judicial warrant, none of it requires probable cause 

and there are thousands of searches like this, countless 

searches, taking place in this country every day, uh, and this has 

been the case for years and years without any discernable, uh, 

suggestion that the Constitution has been shredded or that our 

core freedoms have been jeopardized.  The thing all the 

exceptions I’m talking about have in common, besides being 

reasonable restraints on our freedom, is that none of them is 

nearly as important as protecting our national security – the 

safety of us all collectively.  We’ve done a lot of talking about civil 

liberties these last six years.

One.    

Andrew McCarthy:  

But the conversations I remember the best, uh, are the ones that 

I had with, uh, victims of terrorist attacks, like the World Trade 

Center attack or, uh, the two hundred, uh, mostly Muslim 

Kenyans and, and the people in the surrounding area, uh, who 

were, uh,  victimized by the bombing of the U.S. embassy in 1998 

in Nairobi.  The threat we’re facing is not hype.  It’s, it’s flesh and 

blood real.  And the fundamental rights of these victims – the 

vi…the right to life, the right to liberty, the right to pursue 

happiness – have been stolen from them by our enemies in a way 

that can never be compensated.  Those are our most essential 

civil liberties and the only way we can protect them is by 

enduring comparative trifles in order to let the government do the 

thing that we needed to do, the only thing we really needed to do 

– uh, which is protect us and save lives.   And that’s why you

JEFFREY ROSEN 

No, no, I’m, I, I want my own.  [LAUGHTER]  That ominous one is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 23. 

 

 

 

an Orwellian, uh, and appropriate note for the evening.  

[LAUGHTER]  Congressman Barr has argued eloquently that 

more domestic surveillance of American citizens would not have 

prevented 9/11.  I’d like to offer two additional reasons to try to 

persuade you to argue against the motion, “Better more domestic 

surveillance than another 9/11.”   Uh, the first has to do with 

effectiveness.  It’s possible to protect privacy and security at the 

same time.  Possible, in other words, to reduce the risk of 

terrorism without dramatically increasing the surveillance of 

American citizens.  And the second has to do with abuse.  Uh, 

Mr. McCarthy talked about the comparative trifles, the minor 

incursions on privacy that were necessary since 9/11 to protect 

us.   

 

But in fact, history shows that every time the government has 

asked for and been granted broader powers of surveillance it has 

not directed those expanded powers against suspected terrorists 

but instead has used them to conduct dragnets – ineffective 

dragnets – that have menaced the privacy of innocent citizens 

without making us safer.   What do I mean when I say that it’s 

possible to protect privacy and security at the same time?  I have 

in mind the evolution of a surveillance technology that, uh, some 

of you may have read about – and we can call this the naked 

machine, because this is more or less what it is.   This is the high 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 24. 

 

 

 

tech, three dimensional millimeter imaging machine that was 

initially used at a Florida airport a couple of years ago to, uh, 

detect contraband.  It can identify not only metal, uh, but 

anything that’s buried under clothing, ceramics or plastic.   

 

This is a very effective, uh, X-ray machine.  The only downside is 

that it shows us completely stark naked.  [LAUGHTER]  Now, the 

people who designed this machine came up with a simple 

programming shift.  They found that it’s able to maintain the 

pictures of the ceramics or the plastics and the contraband, but 

to take the pictures of the naked body and scramble it, uh, 

scramble the anatomically sensitive regions into a nondescript 

blob.  Now, obviously, this wonderful alternative – the blob 

machine as opposed to the naked machine – is, for many of us, 

an act of mercy, uh – [LAUGHTER]  especi…especially for those of 

you this evening who are intellidating.  You can in…invite each 

afterward to co…come by and check out the blob machine – 

much safer than, uh, the naked machine.  Uh, and it’s also a 

silver bullet technology.  It provides just as much security 

without any threat to privacy.   

 

It shows, in fact, that it’s possible to, uh, protect our security 

without any, as it were, domestic surveillance.  Now, I’m 

convinced that all of the laws and technologies that have been 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 25. 

 

 

 

proposed since 9/11 can be designed in ways that look more like 

the blob machine than the naked machine.  And it’s, uh, surely 

willfulness that has led the other side to resist these well-

designed laws and technologies, uh, for badly designed ones that 

menace privacy without making us safer.  Let me try to, uh, 

persuade you by giving an example of the evolution of one of the 

most controversial and important surveillance programs since 

9/11.  This is the program that was originally known as total 

information awareness.  In its original incarnation the 

government proposed to unite a lot of information that’s held by 

public and private data bases – uh, magazine subscriptions, 

consumer records, internet browsing – to unite that with public 

arrest records and then to conduct vast data mining that would 

try to predict whose travel patterns resemble those of the 

nineteen, uh, 9/11 terrorists and to stop those people at airports.   

 

Now, what was wrong with this system?  It wouldn’t have worked 

and it posed grave threats to privacy.  But aside from that, Mrs. 

Lincoln, it was an excellent system.  Why would it have been 

ineffective?  Well, if you imagine that the next attack looks 

nothing like the last one.  It, it takes place, God forbid, on a train 

rather a plane – then modeling the travel patterns of the 9/11 

people will lead to the arrest of a lot of retired businessmen in 

Florida who take flying lessons but will miss all the real 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 26. 

 

 

 

terrorists.  And given the huge numbers of false positives, the 

nation’s airports would be brought to a halt.  The second problem 

is privacy.   

 

The comparative trifles that Mr. McCarthy so sneeringly 

dismissed would have allowed the government to store in a 

centralized data base all sorts of, uh, records that it could then 

use to menace its enemies, just as the Nixon Administration did 

when it went after the tax returns of Vietnam protesters and 

threatened them with prosecution.  Now, the evolution of total 

information awareness is a positive story and one that, uh, very 

much supports our side because, uh, because of the opposition 

of a bipartisan coalition of libertarian conservatives like 

Congressman Barr and civil libertarian liberals like Professor 

Strossen.  The system was refined.  First, the government was 

prohibited from sharing information with law enforcement agents 

unless there was evidence of a serious crime or a violent terrorist 

act, avoiding that kind of discriminatory menacing of political 

enemies.  And second, the government abandoned the foolish 

idea of trying to predict future attacks based on the patterns of 

past ones and instead merely confirmed that people are who they 

say they are at the airports – a more modest goal, the one that 

makes us safer.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 27. 

 

 

 

 

What initially began as a naked machine technology evolved into 

a blob machine one and across the range of laws and 

technologies we can tell a similar story.  So the tradeoff that the 

other side falsely presents you with need not exist.  Now, what 

about the abuse?  Uh, it’s clear that every time the government 

has been granted new authorities it’s abused them – not to, uh, 

focus on suspected terrorists but instead to menace innocent 

citizens.  And this is not a surprise because the essence of the 

Patriot Act, which was not a minor change in American 

surveillance laws, uh, but a significant one in several respects.  

The government used to only be able to engage in warrantless 

searches in secret without notifying the people whose data was 

being searched if they could prove in advance that the target was 

a suspected spy or foreign terrorist.   

 

But because of the changes in the Patriot Act the government is 

now able to engage in secret warrantless surveillance of anyone’s 

data merely by asserting that the data is relevant to a terrorism 

investigation.  Should we be surprised when the FBI, uh, using 

this new authority issued not a couple of carefully chosen 

national security letters but, according to the Inspector General’s 

recent report, a hundred and forty thousand national security 

letters in the past three years?  And according to his report’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 28. 

 

 

 

most of those letters were not for suspected terrorists but for 

people who had nothing to do with terrorism.  And should we be 

surprised that that data was not a trifling threat to privacy but 

was stored in a centralized data base and kept for twenty years?   

 

Should we be surprised that people who visited Las Vegas during 

a false terrorist threat had their hotel records and gambling 

records stored in that centralized data without their knowledge 

because of this foolish and misguided program?  Or that the FBI, 

which couldn’t even get David Frum’s address right, was so inept 

that it didn’t keep records of the national security letters that it 

issued and therefore didn’t know when it was getting the right or 

wrong data? How could you possibly trust the government with 

expanded authority when it used the authority that was given so 

recklessly?  The government’s approach to this, uh, pro…problem 

is much like that scene out of Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy, 

where Woody Allen suddenly comes up to Mia Farrow’s window 

on a flying bicycle and says, Hop on.  And she’s sort of skeptical 

and she says, Um.  And he says, Trust me.  It’s me, Andrew.  Hop 

on.  She’s still skeptical.  He says, Trust me anyway.

seriously but we need meaningful oversight focused on genuine 

terrorists, which, while protecting the privacy of innocent

that many of you, according to The Washington Post, are here on

remarkable to me cause the last date I had was in the first 

Reagan Administration.  [LAUGHTER]  I do have to say, though, I 

find it surprising that many people would think that the voice 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 30. 

 

 

 

and appearance of Bob Barr would be an aphrodisiac.  

[LAUGHTER]   First, let me, uh, directly engage with Jeff’s point.  

If there are things that the government can do to increase 

security without reducing privacy we should have already done 

them.  I think at some point, though -- and I think we’re at that 

point now – you reach a trade-off.  It’s not unusual to security 

policy.  Every government decision involves a tradeoff.   

 

When we decide to reduce greenhouse gases by having higher 

mile per gallons, uh, requirements for cars, we know a certain 

higher number of people will die on the highways because the 

cars will be lighter.  Government decisions always involve 

tradeoffs and it’s possible to have tradeoffs that go the wrong 

way.  We have had periods where civil liberties were greater than 

they are today and we have suffered as a result.  So, for example, 

the wall that many of you may have heard about, which 

prohibited the FBI and the CIA from pooling their information 

about terrorist networks is the one thing that the 9/11 

Commission found that directly led to the 9/11 attacks.  Because 

we knew the names of two of the 9/11 hijackers inside the 

country, the agents who worked for the intelligence bureaus were 

unable to communicate that information to FBI agents inside the 

country who could tried to locate them because of rules that were 

set up to protect civil liberties.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 31. 

 

 

 

 

Similarly, when we have tried to put Al Qaeda members on trial 

before 9/11 -- and Mr. McCarthy was one of the prosecutors who 

did that – again, for civil liberties reasons, we turned over 

massive amounts of information to the defense teams.  One of 

those was a list of all the co-conspirators of one of the Al Qaeda 

suspects.  If you think about it that was a list of every single 

person at the time we thought was a member of Al Qaeda.  That 

list was found in Africa after the bombings in Yemen, when our 

agents went out to try to find out who was responsible.  I’m not 

saying that we should go all the way over to security or all the 

way for civil liberties but there is a balance.  And there is a 

tradeoff.  And having more civil liberties can have a cost of 

security, just as increasing security can have a reduction in civil 

liberties.  Also let me admit that in past wars the government has 

reduced civil liberties.  But I would say, if you place it in 

historical perspective those reductions of civil liberties are far 

greater than anything we’re experiencing today.   

 

In 1798, the first war we fought as a country, it was made a 

crime to criticize the government during the war.  In the Civil 

War, President Lincoln, on his own authority, detained 

thousands of American citizens in military detention without any 

recourse to civilian court and had many of them tried by military 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 32. 

 

 

 

judges.  In World War I it was made a crime and people were 

prosecuted for criticizing the war effort, for arguing that people 

should not obey the draft.  In World War II President Roosevelt 

detained over a hundred and twenty thousand loyal American 

citizens.  He initiated military courts, some of who, which were 

used to try American citizens.  He ordered the warrantless 

wiretapping – not just of communications going in and out of the 

country, but every communication inside the United States – 

against a clear statute and Supreme Court precedent at the time, 

over a year and a half before Pearl Harbor.  

 

I think, if you compare those measures that have been taken in 

wartime in American history in the past, the reductions of civil 

liberties we have today are nowhere near as large of a magnitude.  

Take, for example, the political system.  We have had two 

Presidential election – well, one Presidential election during, uh, 

this post-9/11 period.  We have had several Congressional 

elections.  Political control of Congress just switched in the last 

election.  We have had outpourings of new political speech 

through new methods and means.  For example, uh, people I 

wish never existed – bloggers.  This did not exist before 9/11.  

Are we really in such a serious civil liberties crisis if bloggers are 

able to use this new medium to say, uh, I think, quite incredible 

things?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 33. 

 

 

 

 

Take the detention policy that I’m sure, uh, the other side is 

going to talk about.  These are always slippery slope arguments.  

How many American citizens have actually been detained since 

9/11 in military detention?   It’s not the thousands or hundreds 

of thousands from previous wars.  By my count, it’s two.  How 

many citizens of other countries in the United States – permanent 

resident aliens – have been detained as part of the post-9/11 

program?   Again, it’s not thousands and not hundred 

thousands.  I think, again, that number is two.  Take the NSA 

Surveillance Program that we’ve all heard about.  Again, this is a 

program that every President in war has used -- sometimes 

without judicial supervision, often without Congressional 

authorization, often without the knowledge of anybody – in order 

to gain information on pending attacks.  So when you try to take 

into account these factors – the gains of security, which I think 

we’ve had and a loss of civil liberties – how should you think 

about this problem?    

 

Let me make – just close by making just a few points.  First, have 

the expanses… expansions in government power been worth it?  I 

would say, Yes, look at the results.  There have been no attacks 

since 9/11.  And it’s not because of luck.  I think as even the 

9/11 Commission Report, the Silverman-Robb Report have, uh, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 34. 

 

 

 

said, as the administration and members of Congress have said – 

these expanded surveillance powers have resulted in the capture 

or prevent, capture of Al Qaeda members inside the United States 

and the prevention of plots.  Since 9/11 the United States has 

succeeded in capturing or killing two-thirds of Al Qaeda’s 

leadership at the time of 9/11.  Again, that’s not just through 

luck.   Second point:  Are civil liberties being permanently 

reduced?  I think many thoughtful people would say, Yes, there’s 

a tradeoff, but I would be worried if we reduce civil liberties in 

wartime in a way that once the war is over civil liberties are 

permanently reduced.   

 

There is no way for me to tell you what’s going to happen once 

this war is over.  But if you look at past American history wartime 

has not produced a significant permanent reduction in civil 

liberties.  Actually, if you look at the historical record, after war 

we usually as a society experience our greatest growth in civil 

liberties.  The Civil War saw the passage of the Reconstruction 

Amendments and –  

CHRIS BURY 

[OVERLAP]  One.   

JOHN YOO 

…the Emancipation Proclamation.  World War II was followed by 

the Warren Court.  The last point:  complacency, I think, is the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

real enemy.  Even having this debate is a show, a sign of the 

confidence we have that our system is working.  But we should 

be aware that we’re fighting a different kind of enemy, a non-

nation state that conceals its activities as normal civilian 

communications, as normal civilian travel.  The hard thing is 

how, as a society do we fight that, fight a war against an enemy 

who is not following the rules of war and tries to disguise itself as 

one of us.  I’ll close by saying I think so far we have made a 

successful balance between civil liberties and security.  We have 

reduced attacks and threats on the country.  I think those gains 

have been worth it.  And the question is, I think, for all of us 

today, is whether we would feel comfortable reducing the amount 

of government powers and by doing so, give up some of the 

security we’ve bought at such a, I think, dear price since 9/11.  

Thank you.

Thank you very much.  Andy, uh, I hate to burst your bubble but 

the reason why the ACLU is required to submit those who seek 

admittance to, uh, some kind of I.D. procedure is because we are 

only tenants in the building and our strenuous objections were 

not well received by the landlord.  And I have to tell you, just to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 36. 

 

 

 

illustrate how, uh, counter-productive or at least unproductive 

these kinds of pseudo-security measures are, um, ACLU lawyers 

were so distressed that we were subjected – you don’t have 

Constitutional rights against a private landlord.  They were so, 

uh, distressed that they were subjected to those measures that 

they would sign in, uh, under names such as Osama bin Laden 

and Mohammed Atta and had absolutely no problem.  

[LAUGHTER]  Uh, stupid security.  Uh, Bruce Schneier, one of 

the leading security experts in the country, uh, says that what we 

have seen post-9/11 is security theatre, not real security.    

 

Uh, I also feel that since we’ve had two FBI, uh, stories from, uh, 

David and from Andy that I will tell my own FBI story – uh, 

namely, the former FBI Special Agent who is now working for the 

ACLU as a policy counsel, who, uh, did our, uh, extremely 

detailed analysis of the recent report by the Office of Inspector 

General about the massive abuses and fabrications and misuses 

of the national security letter, uh, and the lies that have been told 

about this to the public and to Congress.  And, uh, this gets to 

the fundamental point of trust that has been raised on both sides 

here.  Not, I don’t mean to condemn the FBI as an institution or 

condemn particular individuals.  I’m talking about human nature 

and political nature and official nature – the reasons why our 

founders had the genius of creating a system of checks and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 37. 

 

 

 

balances.  And we are not saying that there should not be any 

monitoring or any surveillance at all.  We are simply saying it 

should be done pursuant to the checks and balances that exist in 

the Constitution but have been, uh, completely ignored in so 

many post-9/11 measures.   

 

I, I welcome the pi…spirit of co…collegiality in this program.  And 

so in that spirit I’m going to begin my argument against – or I 

should say, continue my argument -- against the domestic spying 

and, uh, Big Brother type approach that the other side has been 

advocating by quoting someone whose policies they are defending 

– none other than President George W. Bush himself.  In the 

President’s very first public statement on that infamous date of 

September 11th, he hailed our nation as the brightest beacon of 

freedom in the world.  And he vowed that no one will keep that 

light from shining.  Well, ever since then the ACLU has been 

working very hard to help the President keep that vow.  It would 

be tragic if we let the terrorists terrorize us into abandoning the 

very ideals that they attacked.   

 

And that is the key reason why you must vote no on tonight’s 

resolution, why more domestic surveillance is not better than 

another 9/11.  Indeed, with more surveillance of the type that 

has been proliferating since 9/11 – namely, surveillance that is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 38. 

 

 

 

unjustified, unwarranted, unchecked – not to mention un-

Constitutional – with more of this kind of surveillance the 

terrorists don’t need another 9/11 to accomplish their goals.  Of 

course, on that dreadful date thousands of people were horribly 

killed but their tragic deaths were not the terrorists’ goal.  Rather, 

they were a means to another broader goal – to terrify all of us 

and to sabotage our country’s democratic ideals of liberty and 

justice for all.  Sadly, the terrorists have made great strides 

toward that goal through the original 9/11 attacks – actually, 

more accurately, through our own government’s reaction to those 

attacks.  That key point was well captured by some satiric but 

apt definitions from The Nation magazine’s online dictionary of 

current political terminology.   

 

Here are its two definitions of Patriot Act – sad but true.  The first 

one is:  the pre-emptive strike on American freedoms to prevent 

the terrorists from destroying them first.  [AUDIENCE 

RESPONSE]  [00:58:55:25]  The second is:  the elimination of one 

of the reasons why they hate us.  In my limited time I can’t 

respond to all of the, uh, misguided, misleading statements you 

have heard tonight from my – with all due respect – to my 

opponents.  Um, but I’m going to start by briefly listing some of 

the major reasons for rejecting these kinds of measures.  Uh, 

first, I want to reiterate that we are not opposing, uh, surveillance 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 39. 

 

 

 

per se but only surveillance that is not carried out in accordance 

with the Constitution’s precepts.   

 

Many leading law enforcement and national security experts 

confirm that such Constitutionally appropriate surveillance is at 

least as effective as the illicit post-9/11 measures.  And let me 

quote one of them, who has been very outspoken – Judge William 

Webster, who was Director of both the FBI and the CIA under 

Presidents Reagan and Bush I – criticizing the sweeping post-

9/11 measures.  He said, From 1981 to 2000 the FBI prevented 

more than one hundred thirty terrorist attacks.  We used good 

investigative tech…techniques and lawful techniques.  We did it 

without all the suggestions that we’re going to jump all over 

people’s private lives.  We don’t need to go in that direction.  Uh, 

second, the Constitutional standards -- in particular the Fourth 

Amendment’s core requirement of individualized suspicion – uh, 

that is designed to preserve both safety and individual liberty.  In 

contrast, too many post-9/11 surveillance programs are just 

overly broad, dragnets, fishing expeditions.  And that means by 

definition, they are doubly flawed.  On the one hand, they’re 

sweeping in too much information about too many completely 

innocent individuals, and on the other hand, they are failing to 

hone in on the dangerous ones.   As many critics have put it, the 

government is trying to find a needle in the haystack, by adding 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 40. 

 

 

 

more hay to the stack.   

CHRIS BURY 

One.   

NADINE STROSSEN 

Uh, my next point is that by state-voting civil liberties, we are 

ignoring the more effective measures that would in fact, 

according to national security experts and counter-terrorism 

experts, be more effective as well as consistent with civil liberties.   

Uh, since our opponents have referred to the 9/11 Commission 

report, I have to say that I, uh, read that report completely 

differently, out of 41 specific recommendations of steps we 

should take to prevent another 9/11, almost none of them have 

anything to do with increasing the government’s surveillance 

power.   And unfortunately, according to, uh, the report, with 

letter grades that was issued a couple of years after the initial 

recommendations, the government got D’s and F’s on most of the 

very significant, concrete recommendations, so we have not 

exhausted those, uh, alternatives that would help to make us 

both safe and free.   Unfortunately, the government now has gone 

in the opposite direction, uh, and if we increase this kind of 

surveillance, uh, we are going to have the worst of both worlds.

Because we will all be less free, but not more safe—   

CHRIS BURY 

Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  And thank you to all our 

panelists for their opening arguments today.  I’m now ready to 

announce the results of the pre-debate vote to see where this 

audience stands coming into tonight’s debate.   Before the 

debate, 41 percent of you voted for the motion…37 percent voted 

against the motion, and 22 percent were undecided, rounding up 

all those numbers.  So we’re ready to begin the Q-and-A portion 

of the program.   The idea is to, uh, mix up some of your 

questions, some of my questions, and someone on each side of 

the auditorium will come to you with a microphone so please 

stand if you want to ask a question.   We ask again that you 

please make your questions brief and refrain from, um, giving, 

uh, speeches.  Members of the press, if you’re here tonight, 

please identify yourselves and your news organization, and 

members of the audience, you can opt out of, uh, that 

requirement.   Mr. McCarthy, I’d like you to, um, engage on a 

point, maybe with, with Bob Barr.  You said that in an era of 

terror, that surveillance is the best defense that the country has.  

If in fact the war on terror is a war that is not finite, but a war 

that may last for decades, if not centuries, should the 

government’s power…in such surveillance be open-ended, and I’d 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 42. 

 

 

 

like a quick response and if, Bob, you wanna pick up on that very 

point.   

Andrew McCarthy: 

Well, of course it should because…the purpose of the power is to 

prevent attacks, and as long as the threat of attack exists, it 

would make no sense to get rid of the power.    

CHRIS BURY  

So this is not a wartime power, you’re talking about permanent 

surveillance—   

Andrew McCarthy: 

It’s a threat-time power, it’s an asymmetric war, uh, fought by a 

terrorist threat, and these measures are designed, uh, as much 

to thwart the threat as they are to prevail in the ultimate war.  

CHRIS BURY 

Bob?   

BOB BARR 

The current administration defines this war as unending, that is, 

perpetual.  It defines it as entirely global, that is, the streets of 

Baghdad are as much a field for the commander-in-chief to 

operate in as the streets of Atlanta, Georgia, nor your—or New 

York City.   And this administration believes that a President can 

don that mythical commander-in-chief hat whenever he or she 

feels like it, and therefore, trumps any other power in the 

Constitution or law.   That is the great danger here.  The greatest

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 43. 

 

 

 

tool…to— with which the government ought to be equipped to 

avoid another 9/11 is not domestic surveillance, which is the 

topic at hand this evening, but better, more consistent gathering 

of foreign intelligence, and tearing down the walls between one 

agency and another that pre—have prevented and continue to 

stand in the way of effective use of that intelligence, that foreign 

intelligence.   

CHRIS BURY 

John.   

JOHN YOO 

Chris, can—  I just wanna take issue with the underlying premise 

of your question and, and Bob’s response which is there’s no 

reason to think the war on terrorism is going to be endless.  Uh, 

there have been many wars between nation-states and terrorists 

before, and they have ended.   Uh, there’ve been wars in, uh, the 

United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, with terrorists, and they have 

all come to an end.  I think the problem is that we call it the war 

on terrorism so we think we’re at war with everyone who uses 

terrorism as a tactic, which is not the case, we are at war with 

the Al Qaeda terrorist organization, and organizations that help 

it.  And when we defeat that organization the war will come to an 

end.    

DAVID FRUM 

May I have one—one sentence?  I mean I want—because I think 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 44. 

 

 

 

what Bob—Bob Barr said is very important, notice he said he’s 

for enhanced foreign surveillance.  But the moment this—that 

terrorist actually enters the United States, that’s when the 

surveillance must stop.   Because, I guess then you stop being 

dangerous.    

NADINE STROSSEN 

He’s not saying that it has to stop—

No, no, no, nobo—nobody’s—

BOB BARR 

—I said foreign intelligence.   

DAVID FRUM 

Well, we’re—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

None of us is saying—   

BOB BARR 

That’s the key—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

—no surveillance, we’re just saying subject to what kinds of 

oversight and what kinds of protections to make sure, that not 

only is it consistent with individual liberty but also—   

JOHN YOO 

The opposite of—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

—that it’s promoting of national security—

The opposite of more is less.    

JEFFREY ROSEN 

But the exact—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

No, that’s not true.   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

The balance that we’re—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 46. 

 

 

 

NADINE STROSSEN 

It’s more targeted which means it will be more effective—   

CHRIS BURY 

Okay.  May—now—   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

The, the balance that—excuse me, the balance that we’re arguing 

for is precisely the one that prevailed before the Patriot Act, and 

we’re not taking issue with all of the Patriot Act, but with those 

provisions, mostly those dealing with national security letters and 

warrantless searches, that allow surveillance in secret, merely by 

asserting that it’s relevant to terrorism.   The small reform that 

we’re arguing for is to restore the pre-Patriot Act requirement that 

the suspect has to be a suspected spy or terrorist or his 

associate.  And the administration, in rejecting that simple 

reform, uh, has opposed sunset provisions, and made clear that 

it wishes these changes to be perpetual, so John’s notion that 

these will evaporate is inconsistent with the administration’s—   

DAVID FRUM 

But my, my ears—   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

—determination to change domestic surveillance law forever—   

DAVID FRUM 

My ears are ringing at this phrase “targeted.”  Because, I will 

agree with you that many of the things the US government does 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 47. 

 

 

 

including those bag searches, are stupid, and pointless.  Um, but 

the rea— precisely the reason, that ev—that everybody’s toiletries 

and magazine reading is on display when you enter an airplane,  

is, in order to avoid targeting.   Uh, that what—what—what the 

federal government has done since 9/11 is have a very conscious 

decision, they’re going to play—to use a sports analogy, they’re 

going to play the me—they’re going to play the players, they’re not 

going to pay—play the ball, and so we have—   

NADINE STROSSEN  

David, we’re not—   

DAVID FRUM 

—this vast, untargeted—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

No—   

DAVID FRUM 

—project, precisely because organizations like the ACLU have 

opposed things like—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

I’m sorry—   

DAVID FRUM 

—the Trusted Traveler program—   

NADINE STROSSEN  

—you completely misunderstand our position, it depends what 

the basis is for targeting.  Individualized suspicion, based on 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 48. 

 

 

 

what you do, not racial profiling based on who you are.    

DAVID FRUM  

But the ACLU—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

And I have to say—   

DAVID FRUM 

—is opposed to the Trusted Traveler program, right—   

NADINE STROSSEN  

—law enforcement officials have agreed, that demographic 

profiling is as ineffective as it is violative of individual rights, 

because—   

Andrew McCarthy: 

There’s as many law enforcement—    

NADINE STROSSEN  

—the terrorists can get around the profile very easily—   

Andrew McCarthy: 

There’s—there’s as many law enforcement officers who disagree 

with that as dis—as disagree with it.    

NADINE STROSSEN  

Well, uh—   

Andrew McCarthy: 

And your flat statement that the Fourth Amendment requires 

individualized suspicion is just wrong.

Okay, before we get too deep into the woods…  [LAUGHTER]  of

have some questions, so, uh, if you’re ready, there’s somebody 

with a microphone standing by, so, uh, who do we have.  A young 

woman in…in the back right there.  [PAUSE]  Oh, I’m sorry, no, 

go ahead, if you—   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

No, no, I’m sorry—   

CHRIS BURY 

Whoever gets the microphone first, please, you’re on.   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

How do we know—how do we have proof that someone’s a 

terrorist until they commit a terrorist act? 

CHRIS BURY 

Would you like to direct that to—   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Jeffrey Rosen—   

CHRIS BURY 

—one side or one panelist—   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

Uh, foreign intelligence law since it—the, uh, law was passed in 

the 1970s presumes that, uh, there’s a level of suspicion that 

stops short of probable cause that someone’s committed a crime, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 50. 

 

 

 

but makes pretty clear that we think of this as a really bad 

person.  And, uh, this was a balance that no one suggested, uh, 

caused 9/11, and what’s so interesting about the other side is 

their, uh, failure to say that that standard is too high.   There’s 

no evidence that anyone wasn’t the object of a FISA warrant 

because there wasn’t a high enough degree of suspicion.  

They’re—they wanna completely throw out individualized 

suspicion, and have hundreds and thousands of warrants for, 

uh, people who just happened to show up at the airport.   So this 

is not a subtle, uh, uh, uh, distinction, and we’re convinced that 

by resurrecting that simple requirement—  You could even 

broaden it a little bit, if you wanna talk about the technical 

details, there’ve been thoughtful civil libertarians who have said, 

you could have probable cause that someone’s a suspected spy 

or terrorist, or his or her associates.   At least some connection to 

an identifiable, dangerous bad guy.   

NADINE STROSSEN 

And—   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

It’s the dragnet searches that are, uh, threatening and, and the 

other side has provided no justification—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

And the [INAUDIBLE]—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 51. 

 

 

 

CHRIS BURY 

Let’s let the other side, John had a point here.    

JOHN YOO 

First of all, I think it’s a great question because, under the 

current law within the United States, as Jeff said, you need to 

have probable cause that someone’s a terrorist before you can 

slap a wiretap on ‘em, and it shows a fundamental confusion 

between how we think of terrorism.   I think the other side thinks 

of it as a crime, and as best handled through the standard 

criminal justice system which is this probable cause approach.  

Makes a lotta sense when as a society, we are willing to accept 

the harms of terrorism and retrospectively, after it occurs, then 

try to use a law enforcement system.   What 9/11 showed us is 

that, our government is trying to act prospectively to stop 

terrorist attacks before they occur.  And in order to do that we 

cannot rely on a system which says, prove to me that this person 

is already a terrorist because of criminal actions they have 

already engaged in,  because at that point, usually, as we saw in 

9/11, they are already dead, and there’s no one to hold 

responsible in the criminal justice system—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

And as—as John himself knows, that is absolutely not the 

standard, it is much watered down, as Andy said, the court has 

not applied the strict Fourth Amendment probable cause 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 52. 

 

 

 

requirement in this context but required just some basis for 

suspicion.   And let me tell you, the opposite danger, not only to 

individual rights but to national security, the FBI has been 

complaining bitterly about this sweeping National Security 

Agency, uh, intercepts because it has led to countless hours of 

wasted time, tracking down, quote, leads, that lead nowhere, to 

dead ends,  so again, the notion of honing in on somebody, as to 

whom we have some basis for having suspicion, is more effective 

from the security point of view, as well as from an individual 

rights point of view.    

Andrew McCarthy: 

Nadine is again demonstrating the difference between a law 

enforcement mind-set and a criminal justice mind-set.  Uh, if you 

wait until you have probable cause that someone is an agent of a 

foreign power, you have waited too long.   Uh, and that may be 

what the, the standard is in the criminal justice system, that may 

be what’s appropriate in the criminal justice system, but the 

Fourth Amendment has never required that, what the Fourth 

Amendment requires, is that searches be reasonable.   And if our 

goal is going to be to stop terrorist acts, rather than to bring 

people to justice, that has to be the standard that we deal with, 

and we have to do with an intelligence mind-set, which is far 

different from the criminal mind-set, when the FBI investigates a 

crime, they expect to bat about .900.   They expect that most of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 53. 

 

 

 

the time when they conduct an investigation they’re gonna get 

their man, uh, and they’re gonna successfully prosecute him.  

Intelligence doesn’t work that way.  If you hit one for 15, you’re 

probably doing well.   But it’s chasing the needle in the haystack 

that intelligence is about, and if you’re gonna apply criminal 

justice standards to that task, you’re finished because—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

How about three—   

Andrew McCarthy: 

—you can’t prevent anything—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

—how about three out of 153,000—   

CHRIS BURY 

Let’s move off this point—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

—to use the NSL numbers—   

CHRIS BURY  

—just for a few seconds, we have another question, yes sir, from 

the audience right there on the, on the end, yes.  There you go.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

Yes, sir—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

This is a question for the, uh, people against the motion, would 

you—I—any of you feel the slightest bit differently about this 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 54. 

 

 

 

proposition if you either trusted the administration or felt that 

they were competent in the performance of their duties?    

NADINE STROSSEN 

We took exactly the same position as did Bob Barr with respect to 

the, uh, last so-called anti-terrorism act under the Clinton 

administration.  Um, and I do have to say that the opponents 

here are, uh, completely ideologically neutral and very diverse.   

Um, libertarians, civil libertarians join forces with a lot of, uh, 

conservative organizations that really are committed to reducing 

government power over our private lives.   And, it’s because the 

impulse of government is necessarily to increase its power, 

regardless of, uh, what their politics are.  We had a long litany 

from John Yoo about, um, past administrations including some 

human rights heroes in other contexts, Franklin Delano 

Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln—   In a wartime situation, they all 

react the same way which is to expand their power to the con—

constitutional limit, and beyond, and in 20/20 hindsight, we look 

back and we see that none of those measures did anything, to 

add actual protection to our national security.   

CHRIS BURY  

Nadine, what about the common-sense argument, advocated by 

the other side that, Americans are more than willing to give up 

some liberties whether they’re going to a Yankee game or whether 

they’re going through the airport security, do you see a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 55. 

 

 

 

fundamental difference between that and surveillance on the part 

of the, of the government.   

NADINE STROSSEN 

I think the common-sense argument, speaking for myself and 

also it’s actually reflected in constitutional doctrine is that, no 

freedom is absolute except probably the freedom to think and to 

believe which stays entirely within your heart, head and soul, 

but, in acting in the real world, no right is absolute.  It’s just that 

government has a heavy burden of justification.  It has to show 

that the restriction is gonna be effective in actually making you 

safer, and that nothing that is less violative of your rights would 

be as effective.   And, think about it.  Of course, most of us would 

be willing to give up some liberty if that was the price to pay to 

bring about security.  But how many of us would be willing to 

give up liberty, without gaining security in return?  Is that 

common sense?  Or to give up more liberty than we have to, in 

order to get the same amount of security.    

DAVID FRUM 

Well, how about this proposal.  What if we were to say, why don’t 

we let, not only people choose, but let each person make their 

own individual choice about how much they personally were 

prepared to do.  For example, if you wanna fly, um, you can have 

a shorter line if you’re prepared to let the airline know more 

about you, and a longer line if you’re prepared to know—   We 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 56. 

 

 

 

could each make our choice.  And civil liberties un—groups, 

[APPLAUSE]  have consistently fought and fought and fought, 

when airlines—American Airlines has been promising this now 

for three years.  And we could each—we could let the market 

decide, and you could be in the long line,  and I’m happy to let 

them know how long I’m—I’ve been in my present abode and how 

many kids I have and I’ll go in the short line.   

NADINE STROSSEN  

And I have no illusion, as somebody who flies a couple hundred 

thousand miles a year and has no desire to die, uh, that way, I 

have no illusion that that would do anything other than save me 

time.  I have no illusion that would make me safer.  How many of 

the 9/11 terrorists had valid ID’s.  How many of them would’ve 

sailed through, uh, and been treated as trusted travelers 

themselves—    

DAVID FRUM 

They—they had—they had fake driver’s licenses, many of them—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

Yeah—   

DAVID FRUM 

—under, uh, under—   

NADINE STROSSEN  

And those would—that would’ve been enough to get them there, 

every security expert says that this is false—gives us a false 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 57. 

 

 

 

illusion of security, it—    

DAVID FRUM 

You’d have to give ‘em a little bit more than a driver’s license, 

you’d have to give ‘em a whole battery of information, and the 

airlines, under the threat of litigation—   

NADINE STROSSEN  

Ask any teenager about how easy it is to get a false ID.   

DAVID FRUM 

Okay, so the point is, you don’t—your answer is, no, we will not 

let people make that individual choice, we will not allow airlines 

and their customers as private actors to say, let’s, let’s put this to 

a truly personal individual trade-off test.   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

But we’re not talking about market choices, you can’t opt out of a 

database with 100,000 people in it.  And obviously people react, 

uh, intuitively to the place where the security hits them, so if 

they have to wait a little longer they’ll make the trade-off.   

NADINE STROSSEN 

The so-called security.   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

But what we’re talking about here, are fundamental changes in 

laws and technologies that make it impossible to escape from 

dragnet and ubiquitous surveillance, and, and transform the very 

nature of society.   And this is something just as in, in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 58. 

 

 

 

environmental law, where, uh, market choices are completely 

inadequate, and that’s why constitutional  values, whether or not 

you think that this stuff is required by the Constitution, or 

implicated.   

CHRIS BURY  

But Jeffrey, doesn’t that argue for what the proponents are, are 

saying, that the technology has changed so much, and you have 

government agencies who are mining hundreds of thousands of 

communications, uh, in, in literally nanoseconds, doesn’t that 

make it, um, almost impossible for probable cause, warrants, uh, 

and, and court orders to, uh, to get at this information.  

JEFFREY ROSEN 

It makes it easier, you don’t have to show up at a magistrate’s, 

uh, office and read, uh, a warrant in person, you can e-mail or 

BlackBerry a request, to a secret court which could grant it 

immediately.   Or you could have programmatic warrants that 

would say, this broad category of person looks suspicious.  There 

is great familiarity in foreign intelligence surveillance law in 

dealing with broad, uh, categories of data mining and so forth.   

What’s unprecedented about the Patriot Act, and what the 

previous question smoked out is that, much of the Patriot Act 

was actually proposed by the Clinton and Bush administration 

after Oklahoma City, and opposed by the same heroic bipartisan 

coalition led by my, uh, colleagues, that are less successful after

the, uh, uh, 9/11.   But it would be, uh, they provided no reason 

for why that framework wouldn’t be just as effective, you could 

have broad surveillance, it just wouldn’t be unlimited, and the 

unlimited surveillance is ineffective, and threat—it threatens 

privacy—   

CHRIS BURY  

We’ve got about five minutes left in the Q-and-A so we have some 

questions, yes, sir, right here—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

To, to—this is really addressed to the, the panel against the 

motion.  What, what seems to be missing in your argument is a 

lack of, of, of addressing the nature of the threat.  The threat 

seems to me…is that our terrorists today have technology too and 

they have technology that…affects the existential nature of our 

society.   And don’t you believe, that there should be at least 

some moderation in your point of view and flexibility, relative to 

the threat that you’re confronting.  So that it’s one thing to 

protect, uh, individual rights, when a relatively limited threat 

exists.   But when you’re talking about an existential threat to the 

nation…to millions of people, don’t you have to suspend, at the 

very least, this firm, rigorous approach?  That’s my question—   

BOB BARR 

Uh, the, the, the threat to our, to our nation at the time the Bill of 

Rights was drawn up and adopted by this nation, was far greater 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 60. 

 

 

 

than the threats we face today, I dare say, we faced at the time, 

the very protections against unlimited government intrusion that 

are embodied for example in the Fourth Amendment, uh, were 

such that the very existence of our nation was clearly threatened 

by the greatest military power on the face of the earth, not a 

handful of cells but a military power that could wipe us off the 

face of the earth as a sovereign nation, that is Great Britain.   In 

the face of that overwhelming threat, our founding fathers in—

understood that the answer to your question is no, government 

should not, even facing the most dire threat to this nation, 

allow…or the people should not allow government, even facing 

that level of threat, to invade their privacy without a sufficient 

reason.   And indeed, there is great flexibility, that you mention, 

already embodied in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  

Great flexibility.  There is tremendous flexibility built into the 

Patriot Act, already.  And yet the other side is arguing by the 

terms of the question here this evening…is that insufficient, and 

should government have, essentially unfettered power.  And the 

answer to that, should be no, the same as it was no in the 18th 

century when these very precious mechanisms for guaranteeing 

our, our inherent rights were crafted.   

CHRIS BURY  

John, I think I’d like you to respond to that because you were 

instrumental in crafting the administration’s legal opinion on that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 61. 

 

 

 

very point about whether the President could go beyond the 

foreign intelligence surveillance court, and without any warrants 

at all, eavesdrop not only on the foreign…agents, but on people 

inside the United States.   

JOHN YOO 

There—there are two things going on here.  First of all, with the 

Patriot Act, which is not the focus of your question, [UNCLEAR] 

focus of your question.  There is a system of secret courts and 

secret evidence that issues secret warrants for secret wiretaps.   

That system was created was created in 1978.  The Patriot Act 

amended some of those provisions, but the basic structure is one 

that we’ve been happy to live with, for almost 30 years.   And so, 

this claim that the Patriot Act was this huge revolution I think is, 

is mistaken.  The second thing I would say is, in terms of the 

ability of the President to go beyond the Patriot Act, that’s based 

on history, as I said.   Every President—and as Andrew said, 

every President from Woodrow Wilson on, used exactly those 

same authorities, when confronted by a foreign attack or foreign 

threat, we’re not arguing here for unfettered power, we’re not 

arguing that these powers ought to be used in peacetime, we’re 

not arguing that these powers ought to be used to catch common 

criminals.   I’m—I actually personally don’t think any evidence 

from those, uh, surveillance programs should be entered into 

court in any kind of criminal prosecution—

NADINE STROSSEN 

So, do you—   

JOHN YOO 

They are there, to try to prevent a future attack.  And it seems—

and this is really David’s key point.  It seems weird, right?  If 

you’re outside the United States and you’re a terrorist, the NSA 

has unlimited ability to track—you don’t have to go to court and 

get a warrant, to O—to surveil Osama bin Laden,  if Osama bin 

Laden were to move to the United States, then, a whole system of 

court-ordered procedures are required under the other side’s 

framework.  That is a perverse—  

NADINE STROSSEN 

But that’s not—   

JOHN YOO 

—and exactly reverse incentive—   

NADINE STROSSEN  

Let’s not exaggerate—   

JOHN YOO 

—to one we should be creating—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

—court-ordered procedures from a court that has almost never 

denied anything the government has asked for in a secret 

proceedings which also has the power—   and the government 

has the power to engage in surveillance before getting a court

order, but John, the most striking thing in your answer, was your 

statement that these ex—   To quote John Ashcroft, had a 

different view, he described the Patriot Act as giving the 

government sweeping, new surveillance powers, that was his 

exact quote.  I can give you a citation—

NADINE STROSSEN  

Um, and, and, and you—and you know that the government has 

shown that it has used most of those sweeping new powers in 

ordinary criminal cases, uh, fraud, gambling, drug crimes.  I’m 

not condoning any of those crimes, but, isn’t it interesting to hear 

you say, that you oppose the way it has mostly been used in fact?   

JOHN YOO 

I don’t think it’s—the NSA wiretapping program has not been 

used to prosecute garden-variety cri—I mean I could be—   

NADINE STROSSEN  

We’re talking about the Patriot Act.  Remember the NSA went 

beyond—   

JOHN YOO 

See, that—that’s what I’m trying to make clear that—   

NADINE STROSSEN 

—and around and underneath the Patriot Act—   

JOHN YOO 

Most of you, I thought you all just said the Patriot Act was 

something, most of which you supported, some of which you 

didn’t, but I thought we were talking about the NSA wiretapping 

program where there is a very clear distinction about what that 

evidence can be sought for and it’s not to be used for criminal 

prosecutions and as far as I know, has yet to—it never has been 

used for criminal prosecutions—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 65. 

 

 

 

JEFFREY ROSEN 

We—we don’t know what it’s been used for because it’s been 

entirely secret and the government has refused to tell us what it 

is.   

Andrew McCarthy: 

Well, wait—   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

But we do know that the evidence from the national security 

letters has been used in ordinary criminal prosecutions, in fact 

the Inspector General found that there’d been at most two 

terrorism-related convictions, but about 30, which was out of 

140,000 letters, only 30 other criminal convictions, for crimes 

that had nothing to do with terrorism.   I have to say, the 

gentleman earlier asked, would you give up nothing.  I would 

make a deal with John, he says, uh, give us this broad, 

warrantless surveillance power, but we can only use it, uh, for 

intelligence and we can’t introduce it in criminal prosecution, I 

would take that deal.   That’s a deal that the Germans have 

struck, they allow broad, uh, intelligence powers, but it can’t be 

used for prosecutions, and for me, that’s an example of the 

thoughtful balancing of privacy and security,  that allows us to 

have both at the same time but, but every time the 

administration has been presented with this deal, it has been, 

uh, completely adamant, it’s refused to, uh, make those sensible

trade-offs, and that’s why you have to vote against their 

position—   

CHRIS BURY  

Just, just about 20 seconds left, and it, it sounds on the face of it 

like a reasonable deal.    

Andrew McCarthy: 

It’s the law of the United States, it’s long been the law of the 

United States that if agents are searching for a legitimate reason, 

if they have lawful reason to be searching what they’re searching, 

uh, you can use the evidence even if it’s not what they were 

looking for in the first place.   Now I’m not saying that it’s not a—

the possibility of a reasonable compromise.  But the suggestion 

that it’s an unreasonable position not to wanna negotiate that is, 

is, is—I, I just have to disagree with that.   

CHRIS BURY  

Andrew, thank you very much, and that ends the 

discussion…portion of our evening.  [APPLAUSE]  And now we’re 

gonna have the final remarks from our panelists, beginning with 

the side opposing the motion.  And panelists for this, if you’d just 

please stay, um, seated.  You’ll each have, uh, two minutes to 

make your closing statement, and we’ll start speaking against the 

motion, Bob Barr.   

BOB BARR 

Thank you.  I had the opportunity in April of 2000 to testify, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 67. 

 

 

 

before the House Intelligence Committee, on the issue of whether 

or not the National Security Agency or NSA engaged in or should 

engage in, electronic surveillance of US persons within the United 

States without court order.  My position was that the Foreign 

Intelligence Surveillance Act which is the law of the land, 

required warrants in such instances.  There was another 

gentleman that testified that very same day on the very same 

issue.  General Mike Hayden.   At the time, head of the NSA.  

Now, another star on his shoulders, four on each side, head of 

the CIA.  He testified, that day, according to the Foreign 

Intelligence Surveillance Act, if in fact our government deems it 

appropriate or necessary to conduct electronic surveillance…of a 

US person in this country, the government is required to, always 

has, and will, secure a court order.   Because that is the law of 

the land and the NSA obeys and abides by the law of the land.  

Strange.  That law, in its operative parts remains the law of the 

land today.  Yet that same man, now takes a very different 

attitude.   There’s been no declaration of war…what has changed 

is simply the perception that now, because of 9/11…the 

President can order those under him to violate the law because 

he deems it appropriate and necessary in his perception of his 

role, as commander-in-chief.   Fact of the matter is, folks, we are 

a nation that has a Bill of Rights, it cannot be and should never 

be allowed to be trumped by those seven words that the President 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 68. 

 

 

 

serves as commander-in-chief.  The Bill of Rights is the Bill of 

Rights.  It prevails.   

CHRIS BURY 

Bob Barr—   

BOB BARR 

In the sense of privacy that it protects, ought not to be frittered 

away, by granting the government yet more power in addition to 

the vast power that it already has.  Thank you—   

CHRIS BURY  

Thank you for your closing remark.  [APPLAUSE]  And in his final 

rebuttal arguing for the motion, David Frum.    

DAVID FRUM 

I want you to notice as you think about how you’re going to vote, 

the, both the abstract and the radical character of the arguments 

of the people on the other side.  They’re abstract, in that they 

have not given you one example of what you yourselves as 

individuals ought to be afraid of.   What is this tremendous 

incursion.  Now I ask you to think about this to think, do I feel 

less free to speak my mind.  Do I feel that there are thing—that 

there are secrets that are important to me, that are more in 

danger of exposure now than they were before.   And then I ask 

you to consider, how many terrorist attacks have there been on 

US soil since 9/11, and what is the terrible record, through the 

1990s, from the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 69. 

 

 

 

to the—to the attack in 2001.   Uh, I want you also to notice how 

radical their claim is.  We are not debating that better limitless 

surveillance, better surveillance at the sole discretion of the 

President, better lawless surveillance.  What we are saying is, 

better the higher level of surveillance that has prevailed since 

9/11, than this risk.  Better, more.   They have—they have—uh, 

they, their argument, is…complete—is, is not modulated, it is not 

balanced, it is to say that, nothing, there is to be, there is to be 

no more.  I sometimes think, as I, as I’ve been listening to this 

argument, what would they have said, had they been present at 

the introduction of the stop sign.   They would’ve looked at it and 

said, this is the first step on the slippery slope toward the total 

abolition of motion.  [LAUGHTER]  No one will ever be able to go 

anywhere ever again.  Um…uh…the, the—what we are debating 

here, is more and less.   We are debating balance.  Um, I think 

that, when we identify, as we surely will, specific problems and 

abuses that have appeared since 9/11, they ought to be fixed.  Of 

course they ought to be fixed, and that is why this original Patriot 

Act was sunsetted, that is why, uh, Congress, uh, has oversight 

powers, of course they—those things must be addressed.   But 

what—we must do this with an understanding of danger.  We 

must ask ourselves, when we look back at that world before 

9/11, when people—

DAVID FRUM 

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]   

CHRIS BURY 

And against the motion, Jeffrey Rosen.   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

We don’t need lectures on radicalism from the other side.  This 

was the administration, led by our, uh, distinguished opponents, 

who argue that the President has the unilateral authority to 

ignore or reinterpret laws including the Foreign Intelligence 

Surveillance law, with which he disagrees, because it infringes 

his power as commander-in-chief.   Uh, and this is the 

administration that has indeed used the broad and sweeping, 

new and radical powers that it’s been granted, which were a 

warrant for unreviewed, uh, limitless surveillance by the FBI, in 

ways that have nothing to do with terrorism.   Uh, they are the 

radicals, our position is the traditionally conservative, uh, 

position.  We really wanna resort the law as it was, uh, before the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 71. 

 

 

 

Patriot Act, we’re willing to engage in the kind of sempr—sensible 

compromises that came out, uh, in the debates, we are not 

uncompromising at all in this regard.   But we want to avoid a 

transformation in American, uh, liberties from which the country 

might never recover.  Uh, David Frum asked for an a—a specific 

example, uh, I’m happy to provide one and to close with one and 

that’s the example of Britain.   Britain, the cradle of Western 

democracy, was the country that wired itself up in the 1990s, 

with so many surveillance cameras that it now resembles the 

threat—uh, the set of The Truman Show.   Uh, this was defended 

as a way of stopping IRA terrorism, but the cameras are now 

used for very different purposes.  They’re used to charge a car tax 

for every car that comes into the city, and recently we learned, 

microphones have been set up in city centers, to have ominous 

voices warning people when they’re getting drunk in public.   I—I 

was, uh, I experienced a society that had microphones and 

surveillance cameras, and that was, uh, in Warsaw in 1988 right 

before the Berlin— the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Uh, and the British 

public is indifferent to statistics showing that there is no 

connection between the spread of the cameras and the decline 

and prevention of violent crime, or terrorism.   So these things 

are indeed small incursions, and even free societies can 

transform themselves incrementally, in ways whose effects are 

only beginning to be understood.  And in a world where it’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 72. 

 

 

 

possible to track people from door to door, and to, uh, store that 

in ubiquitous databases,  ubiquitous surveillance that might 

make it possible to see where it get up in the morning and which 

subway I take and—  

CHRIS BURY 

Jeffrey—   

JEFFREY ROSEN 

—where I end up going to work, uh, is not, uh, an Orwellian 

possibility, but a very real probability, and we ask you to resist it 

by voting against the motion.    

CHRIS BURY  

Jeffrey Rosen, thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  And his closing thought 

for the motion, Andrew McCarthy.   

Andrew McCarthy: 

With due respect to the other side, what you’re hearing is radical.  

Um, we now have increased surveillance.  We’ve had it since 

9/11, I don’t think it’s sweepingly increased surveillance, but it’s 

certainly increased surveillance beyond what we had in the 

1990s.  What they’re telling you, is better another 9/11 than 

increased surveillance.   Now, this is New York.  Ask yourself, 

what have you been going through for the last five years, six 

years, um, whether it’s keeping you up at night that, uh, the 

government is, uh, uh…frittering away with, with your personal 

information or whatever else is that, uh, that is the grave concern 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 73. 

 

 

 

here.  And ask you, ask yourself, if that’s anything like what 9/11 

was like.  And whether in a million years, you would ever, ever 

wanna go through anything like that again, uh, if you could 

instead, uh, deal with the kinds of, uh, trade-offs between liberty 

and security that we’ve had in the last six years.   That’s not even 

a contest.  And to say that it is, that’s about as radical as 

anything I can imagine.  Now one of the, one of the, last thing I’d 

like to address is, this idea of perfect security and, and, risk of 

error.  Investigation whether it’s law enforcement or, or, uh, 

national security, is a human process, and we are not going to be 

able to repeal human error.   There are going to continue to be 

errors, there are gonna continue to be, uh, roguish acts by people 

who are rogues.  Rogues are gonna be rogues, no matter what the 

rules are.  When you change the rules, when you, when you, 

uh…clamp down on what your agents are able to do, what you’re 

actually clamping down on, are the good-faith people who you 

didn’t need to worry about in the first place.   Um, these powers 

are in place because they’re needed, uh, to ferret out potential 

threats, because there is no perfect security, we can line—we can 

wire the whole place up with cameras and, uh, and bugs and the 

like—

CHRIS BURY  

Thank you.  Andrew McCarthy, thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  And her 

closing thought, Nadine Strossen.    

NADINE STROSSEN 

I’m afraid that Andy has not understood our position at all.  Our 

position is that more surveillance of the sweeping, random, mass, 

dragnet type we are complaining about, and security experts are 

complaining about post-9/11, is not going to prevent another 

9/11, and in fact not only is it ineffective, but it is actually 

counterproductive to the security goal because it is deterring and 

diverting resources for measures that the com—and security 

community has a consensus would be more effective.   Let me 

give you a couple specific examples.  The mass gathering of data 

about all of our communications.  The government tells us it’s 

gonna engage in data-mining.  Sounds really impressive, doesn’t 

it.  Of course we would like to believe it would work.  Well you 

know who knows that it doesn’t work?  Security experts and 

computer experts.  Let me quote one.  Professor Farley at 

Harvard University, who is a Science Fellow at Stanford’s Center 

for International Security.   Complaining, from a security 

perspective, about the NSA domestic spying program, he says it 

is based on a false assumption, that you can work out who might 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 75. 

 

 

 

be a terrorist based on calling patterns.  But guilt by association 

is not just bad law, it’s also bad mathematics.   [01:38:49:29]  

Security theater, not real security.  And, you know, we put in 

place understandably, the Patriot Act, NSA, domestic spying, 

shortly after 9/11, government officials to their credit wanted to 

do something to at least make us feel more secure.  But you can’t 

do anything meaningful, until you have looked at what the actual 

causes were, of that horrible catastrophe on 9/11.  And that kind 

of analysis was not done until much later, by the joint 

intelligence committees of both houses of Congress, and by the 

Bipartisan Citizens Commission.  And they did not recommend 

the kind of mass surveillance measures that have been advocated 

by our proponents.  And in fact, again, the common-sense, 

concrete steps that all of us blithely assume have been taken, 

have not in fact been taken.  Uh, John Yoo said, well, we’ve 

already done all of that, well, that’s not what Tom Kean—   

CHRIS BURY 

Nadine—    

NADINE STROSSEN

CHRIS BURY 

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  And now, batting clean-up for the 

proponents, John Yoo.   

JOHN YOO 

Well, um, first I wanna apologize for the lack of rhetorical skills 

on at least my part, that should not prevent you from voting for 

our side in the debate.  I’ve just admired the rhetorical gifts of 

everyone else on the panel, and that—from what I can tell that 

consists of calling the other side radical and exaggerating what 

they actually wanna do in the real world.   Um, clearly I’m not an 

expert at this, I did not get the note about the dark suit, 

[LAUGHTER]  which is really the only thing I noticed listening to 

everybody’s discussion.  Uh…two things, one is I think the other 

side fundamentally confuses war versus crime.   Ask yourself 

this.  If the Soviet Union had carried out the 9/11 attacks in 

exactly the same way, exactly same people, would we not be at 

war?  And would we not be justified in using wartime measures 

to try to stop Al Qaeda from carrying out a second attack.  Why 

does the fact that they are not a nation-state require us to go 

back to criminal justice in the pre-9/11 world?  The second thing 

I’ll just say is, it’s an empirical question whether the, the security 

of our country has gone up in response to the increased 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11” (4/18/07) Page 77. 

 

 

 

surveillance measures, I think it has.   There’s the person who 

wanted to blow—blow up—blow up the Brooklyn Bridge, there’s 

too many B’s there, so I’m not good at this.  The guy who wanted 

to blow—blow up the Brooklyn Bridge was caught only because 

of these new measures.   The guy who wanted to carry out 

terrorist attacks in Florida and Southeast Amer—uh, the United 

States who fled the country.  He was only identified, and an alert 

went out only because he was identified using expanded 

surveillance techniques.   So there’s still more we can do.  One 

thing I would like to do as—end as we began.  I think the FBI’s 

utterly incompetent, it’s because, they try to do drug-dealing, 

white-collar crime which I’m sure is of interest to many of you in 

New York, [LAUGHTER]  and all kinds of other things, and 

counter-terrorism.   The reason we keep them all together is out 

of civil-liberty concerns, I would say let’s get rid of the FBI, create 

a real national security counter-terrorist agency [APPLAUSE], and 

let the states and the plo—the states control drug crimes, white-

collar crimes, and get the FBI out of the job of trying to do bank 

robberies and kidnappings.   I think that makes no sense.  That’s 

an improvement we can make, but would require you to vote for 

our side.  [LAUGHTER]   

CHRIS BURY  

And right on time, we like that.  [APPLAUSE]  That concludes the 

closing arguments, now it’s time for you, the jury, to vote once

again.  So, look for that keypad, the thing that looks like a 

calculator, uh, on your arm-rest, this thing, uh…right here.  And, 

uh, we’re not gonna confuse you by changing the code, at 

this…late stage.  [LAUGHTER]   You may be confused enough, I 

don’t know.  So, after my prompt, please press 1 if you are for the 

motion, press 2 if you are against the motion, or 3 if you are 

undecided, 1 for, 2 against, 3 undecided, please go ahead and 

press your buttons now.   We need a little “Jeopardy” music here, 

da-da-da…  [LAUGHTER]  I wanna thank the debaters and 

audience for their participation tonight.  And before I announce 

the results of the final vote, to see who has swayed whom, we 

need to take care of some business.   First, the next Intelligence 

Squared U.S. debate will take place on Wednesday, May 16th here 

at the Asia Society and Museum.  The motion to be debated next 

month is, “Beware the Dragon—A booming China spells trouble 

for America.”   Sounds like a good one, unfortunately the debate 

is sold out.  But, the good news is that, packages for the fall 

2007-spring 2008 series are on sale right now, on-line and by 

phone.  So avoid disappointment and buy those series packages 

now.  Um, tonight’s debate by the way can be heard locally, on 

WNYC AM-820 on Friday, April 27th, at 2 p.m., and some point 

after that it will be heard on hundreds of NPR stations across the 

country, no exaggerations.   Um…copies of some of the panelists’ 

books are for sale, uh, upstairs in the lobby.  And, uh…I think,

David, you’ve got a book out, right?  And, uh, John has got, uh, a 

book, and Jeffrey, so, at least three of our…  [LAUGHTER]  War 

by Any Other Name, is that it, something like that—

Just the white one.  Buy the white one.  [LAUGHTER]   

CHRIS BURY  

So, um, if you wanna help out our panelists in another way, uh, 

buy their books upstairs.  You can also purchase DVD’s from 

previous debates here tonight, or from the Intelligence Squared 

U.S. website.  And finally, please be sure to pick up—it sounds 

like we’re selling things here, doesn’t it?  Uh, please be sure to 

pick up a copy of tomorrow’s edition of the Times of London, and 

the Times Literary Supplement, as you leave the auditorium, but I 

think those are free.   And now, what we have all been waiting 

for, after our debaters worked so hard to sway you, um, you 

decided…after the debate…39.5 percent were for the motion.  So 

a—a bit of a, uh…uh, a bit of a movement, toward your direction.   

Um…after the debate, 55.6 percent were against the motion.  So, 

um… that’s…  And undecided…this shows you how good our 

panelists were, undecided, less than 5 percent.  So.  

Congratulations…  [APPLAUSE]  Which means that, uh, those 

against have carried the day.   So our sincere—sincere 

appreciation for you to being a wonderful audience, and thank 

you, panelists, we appreciate it, thanks.  Thank you.
