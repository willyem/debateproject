[APPLAUSE]   

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ  

Well, thank you all for coming.  This is really exciting for us.  

This is a new venue, and it’s thrilling for us to be downtown in 

such magnificent space as this one.  We have, of course, our 

new voting system which may have some flaws to iron out.  We 

have a new relationship with Bloomberg Television that’s going 

to be televising these debates in addition to our longstanding 

relationship with National Public Radio, where these debates 

are heard in nearly two hundred radio markets around the 

country.  We have a new relationship with Newsweek magazine 

that’s going to be publishing a Point/Counterpoint of what

goes on this evening.  So my role in these proceedings is really 

to frame the debate, to say why it is we thought this was an 

interesting topic and why there’s a reasonable amount to be 

said on both sides.   So, as taxpayers, Americans have funded 

about seven hundred and fifty billion dollars for the stimulus 

package, another seven hundred and fifty billion or more for 

TARP, to relieve the situation for financial institutions.   

 

And at a time of record unemployment doesn’t it make sense 

that these funds are used to the maximum extent possible to 

create jobs for Americans?  Why not require that the 

institutions that receive this money hire American workers?  

Why not, that the state governments and others who are 

expending these funds buy American products?  But let’s 

consider second order consequences.  If we protect high cost 

domestic producers there’s a cost to that in the form of higher 

prices for everyone else --  every consumer, every state and 

local government.  And then think about the third order effects 

– the reactions of foreign governments.  We impose a tax, a 

tariff on tires, the Chinese retaliate with a tariff on chickens --  

real world example of the last week or so.  Well, which of these 

is most important --  the immediate benefit of U.S. job creation 

or the cost to U.S. consumers and the risk of retaliatory 

response from our trading partners?  The future of the global

economy may depend on getting the answer right and we have 

an extraordinarily able group of panelists this evening who I 

think are going to shed some light on this important issue and 

it’s my pleasure at this point to turn the evening over to John 

Donvan.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Robert, very much.  [APPLAUSE]  And this is the 

beginning of our fourth season and Robert Rosenkranz is why 

this is happening.  So on this evening I just want to invite one 

more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz.  [APPLAUSE]   

Welcome to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I’m 

John Donvan and I will be moderating the six people you see 

here on the stage with me at the Skirball Center for the 

Performing Arts at New York University.  We have two tables, 

six debaters, three against three.   

 

We’ll be debating this motion:  Buy American/Hire American 

Policies Will Backfire.  And here, our debaters arguing for the 

motion that Buy American/Hire American Policies Will 

Backfire, Jagdish Bhagwati, University Professor, Economics 

and Law at Columbia University;  [APPLAUSE]  Douglas Irwin, 

Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College;  [APPLAUSE]  

and Susan Schwab, former United States Trade 

Representative.  [APPLAUSE]  Arguing against the motion we

have Leo Gerard, International President of the United Steel 

Workers;  [APPLAUSE]  John R. MacArthur, President and 

Publisher of Harper’s magazine;  [APPLAUSE]  Jeff Madrick, 

Senior Fellow at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy 

Analysis at the New School.  [APPLAUSE]   

 

Now, this is a debate so let’s remind ourselves of what the 

stakes are.  There will be winners and losers tonight.  This is a 

contest.  This is a contest of ideas and persuasion and perhaps 

wit and humor, facts.  But you in the audience play a crucial 

role in this contest because you are the judges.  We are polling 

you both before and after the debate to establish where you 

stand on our motion.  I will be reporting them in just a little 

while, once we’ve had the first results tabulated.  But once 

again, to remind you, our motion is that Buy American/Hire 

American Policies Will Backfire and we would like now to go to 

our vote for the final time.  If any of the members of the 

audience still would like another chance to vote, if you put 

your hands up I’ll know that the answer to that is yes.  And it 

looks like no.  So everybody has, everybody has voted.   So the 

results are being tabulated.  We will have you a vote once 

again at the end of the debate and the side that has changed 

the most minds, who has moved the largest percentage into 

their camp in the course of the evening will be declared our

winner.   

 

Let’s get to the debate.  Speaking for the motion first, [PAUSE]  

--  I’m sorry, I thought I had something out of the order.  

Speaking for the motion first, Douglas Irwin, a professor at 

Dartmouth College.  Free Trade Under Fire is the title of his 

latest book and those four words will tell us why he is here to 

argue for the motion that Buy American/Hire American 

Policies Will Backfire.  Douglas Irwin.  [APPLAUSE]   

DOUGLAS IRWIN  

Well, I apologize if my voice is a little bit gravely but I used up 

most of it yesterday when I achieved a childhood dream of 

seeing the Green Bay Packers play at Lambeau Field.  And I 

learned, aside from the fact that Green Bay can lose a game 

they’re supposed to win, I learned that you can get very funny 

faces on people’s faces when, very funny looks on people’s 

faces when you amble up to them in Green Bay and say, So 

what do you think of them Buy American provisions?  

[LAUGHTER]  It doesn’t, it doesn’t work so well.  It’s a real 

conversation stopper.  What I’d like to do is remind you of the 

proposition before you tonight and that is whether Buy 

American provisions will backfire.  In fact, they’ve already 

backfired so you have little choice but to vote for the 

affirmative.  First of all, what is Buy American?  Buy American 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 6. 

 

 

 

is a provision in federal legislation that mandates the purchase 

of U.S. made products in government contracts.  Now, in some 

sense, who could be against Buy American?  I want people to 

buy American products.  I want a strong and healthy and 

vibrant American economy.  I want good jobs and good wages 

for American workers.  I think we can all agree on those 

propositions.  But that’s not the issue.  The debate here 

tonight is about the means to that laudable end.  Buy America 

may sound like it’s a good idea, but the more you think about 

it, it’s actually counterproductive.    

 

Let me give you a specific example of what Buy America is.  In 

the economic stimulus bill that we talked about earlier, that 

John Donvan mentioned --  it was passed by Congress earlier 

this year --  one section requires the use of American made 

steel in all stimulus related construction projects unless it 

costs more than twenty-five percent above foreign suppliers.  

Now, this is a good deal for the American steel industry but it’s 

a bad deal for the rest of us.  By raising the cost of 

construction projects our nation can afford fewer of those 

projects.  That means fewer jobs will be created with the 

limited amount of money we have to spend.  If we have to pay 

a twenty-five percent premium for steel that leaves less money 

for all the other projects.  In fact, this is not a trivial matter.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 7. 

 

 

 

Picture in your mind for a moment the Bay Bridge in San 

Francisco.  There’s a lot of steel in that bridge.  California had 

to repair the bridge a few years ago and the Buy America 

provisions were enforced.  The domestic steel bid came in at, 

guess what?, twenty-three percent above the foreign bid.  Now, 

why it wasn’t twenty-four percent above, I don’t know.  But 

that added four hundred million dollars to the cost to repair 

the bridge.  That’s almost half a billion dollars for one project.  

Now, what can you do with half a billion dollars?  Instead of 

paying inflated prices for steel you could repair roads, build 

new bridges, build new schools, invest in green technology, 

provide health care for children or even perhaps reduce the 

fiscal deficit that is literally bankrupt... bankrupting the state 

of California.   That’s more than just paying more and getting 

less.  The real problem is this:  Buy America is a bad jobs 

creation program.  Steel is very capital intensive so when we 

increase production we don’t hire a lot of new workers.    

 

There are about a hundred and fifty thousand steel workers in 

the United States.  There are seven million construction 

workers.  There are 1.5 million unemployed construction 

workers.  Construction is really labor intensive.  So if we spend 

more taxpayer money on steel we can afford fewer construction 

projects that will employ more construction workers who really 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 8. 

 

 

 

need the jobs.  So why do we give U.S. steel producers a 

twenty-five percent handicap against foreign suppliers and 

other bidders?  Well, they were the only industry that was 

powerful enough to get it into law.  It’s corporate welfare, pure 

and simple.   

 

What percent of the steel sold in the United States is made in 

the United States?  Seventy percent.  They control seventy 

percent of the market and they want more and they want the 

taxpayer to pay for it.  Buy America has already backfired 

because it creates bureaucratic red tape that has forced state 

and local governments to delay starting infrastructure projects 

and therefore, delay getting people back to work.  In Perkins, 

Oklahoma they’re planning on building a new waste water 

plant for fifteen million dollars.  It was shovel ready.  The 

government came in to give them another 1.5 million in free 

stimulus money.  But it wasn’t free.  It came with Buy America 

and other pieces of red tape and it raised the cost of the 

project even more than the town would be getting from the 

federal government.  So now the town has to go out and 

borrow more money to get the project going.  And this is not an 

isolated example.  Here’s a news article from last week’s Wall 

St. Journal how Buy America can hurt U.S. firms, and it talks 

about how, various ways in which U.S. firms cannot bid on 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 9. 

 

 

 

municipal projects here in the United States because they may 

make components that are sent for final processing in Canada.   

 

They come back from Canada, and it’s called a Canadian 

product even though a lot of the value added is made here in 

the United States.  And that just doesn’t make sense.  Many 

think that Buy America is aimed at China.  Well, we aimed at 

China but we hit Canada and now we’re shooting ourselves in 

the foot.   Canadian governments are boycotting U.S. firms in 

their infrastructure projects and costing us jobs here in the 

United States.  So in sum, Buy America is not a good idea.  It 

raises the cost of --  It sounds like a good idea but it’s not a 

good idea.  It raises the cost of infrastructure projects.  It pads 

the bottom line of the steel industry.  It reduces the number of 

construction workers we can employ with our precious tax 

dollars and when other countries employ their own buy local 

provisions our exporters will be cut out of their lucrative 

market, those lucrative markets abroad and will lose even 

more manufacturing jobs here in the United States.   

 

I’m sure you’ve heard of the saying, What’s good for GM is 

good for America.  Well, we know that’s not true.  And what’s 

good for the steel industry, its workers and its executives is 

not good for America, either, necessarily.  So Buy America is

costly corporate welfare.  It’s already backfired.  Please vote 

affirmative.  Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]   JOHN 

DONVAN  

Thank you, Douglas Irwin.  And now to argue against the 

motion that Buy American/Hire American Policies Will 

Backfire, Leo Gerard, who is the son of a miner from Canada.  

And now that he is International President of the United Steel 

Workers, when he steps up to that microphone he has eight 

hundred, fifty thousand union members standing behind him.  

Leo Gerard.    

LEO GERARD  

Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  I have to tell you that I’ve 

discarded a lot of my notes because I want to correct the 

previous speaker.  The fact of the matter is that China did win 

the bid for the Bay Bridge and the fact of the matter is that the 

Bay Bridge is now almost eight months behind schedule and 

that the steel that came from China won’t hold the weld.  And 

they’re not sure if they’re going to have to rip it all down and 

rebuild it, so that, if we talk about what that represents in lost 

dollars and productivity, it’s way more than the number that 

Doug used.  Let me then go back to my notes.  The fact of the 

matter is that three trillion tax dollars per year are spent by 

the federal government in federal procurement.  And no one is 

saying that it’s simply, that you get the money that comes from 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 11. 

 

 

 

tax dollars and you use it to buy Chinese goods.  

 

And then the fact of the matter is this has gone through the 

roof since the passage of NAFTA and PNTR.  And what we’ve 

done is we’ve lost, in our manufacturing base from 1949 to ’69, 

manufacturing was twenty-eight percent of the economy of 

America and we were the world’s largest creditor nation.  By 

the time we got to the end of last year manufacturing was nine 

percent of the economy and we have now become the world’s 

largest debtor nation.  The fact of the matter is, if we don’t 

start buying products that are made here, what we’ll end up 

doing is borrowing Chinese money to import Chinese parts and 

have laid-off workers.  And the fact of the matter is that Buy 

America stimulates the economy, creates good jobs, makes the 

industrial economy work and if the industrial economy works 

then we need engineers, innovation and we need the other 

pieces that make that economy hum.   

 

There was all kinds of yelling and screaming, when the Buy 

America provision was made public in the stimulus bill, like 

this is something new.  There’s been Buy America provisions 

since 1930s.  And the fact of the matter is that they’ve been 

good for creating jobs.  If we go back to the period from 1994 

when we abandoned, in a much more aggressive way, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 12. 

 

 

 

industrial manufacturing in America, in that period of time 

America has accumulated a 6.5 trillion dollar trade debt.  

We’ve had twenty-five years in a row, exacerbated since 1994, 

of year after year after year record breaking trade deficits.  This 

year people will say, Yeah, well, the trade deficit’s falling down.  

It’s probably going to come in around five hundred billion 

dollars and we’ve had a huge drop.  That’s simply because 

there’s no purchasing power and we’ve had the collapse of the 

credit markets.   

 

There can be an argument made that a large part of the 

economic collapse that we saw is because there was too much 

money in the wrong direction.  And the fact of the matter is 

that, that money, making its hands into a much, much smaller 

group, led to an inability of us to sustain.  And we’ve, over the 

last fifteen years, gone to personal debt that is unsustainable.  

All of that because we’ve abandoned the idea of not only 

making things in America, but buying things that are made in 

America.  I won’t spend too much time, but if we look at what’s 

going on in most of our trading partners, in the E.U. and 

spend time with China... I never heard a word in America 

when French President Sarkozy said that they’re going to 

stimulate their economy and they’re going to stimulate their 

auto industry on the condition that every taxpayer dollar of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 13. 

 

 

 

French currency that’s invested in France is going to go to 

prop up the French auto industry and the French auto 

industry had to commit to no layoffs.   

 

Surprisingly, the European economy is bouncing back faster 

than ours.  I didn’t hear a word.  I didn’t hear a word when in 

May the Chinese government said that their stimulus program 

was going to be steered and directed towards not just Buy 

China --  there is a slight difference --  Buy Chinese.  I didn’t 

hear a word here.  Think of the auto industry.  I’ve only ever 

driven a North American car, big three.  I’ve never had a bad 

one.  But for some reason, we’re prepared as a society to 

tolerate a deficit in automobiles between South Korea and 

Japan of forty-five billion dollars a year.  If a billion dollars 

equals thirteen thousand family-supporting jobs, just in the 

auto sector, year after year after year, we can’t get into their 

market.  They have a view that buying a Japanese car in 

Japan is a good thing.   

 

China has recently announced that it intends to dominate the 

world in renewable energy products.  A company called 

Suntech Power Holdings said in an interview that to build 

market share -- this is what’s coming from China --  to build 

market share it’s selling solar panels on the American market 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 14. 

 

 

 

for less than the cost of materials, assembly and shipping.   

This is a decision made in China.  And we’re saying that we 

want to be the leader in renewable energy but we don’t have a 

program to stimulate demand or to buy renewable energy 

products that are made in America.  Having said that, I see 

that my time is up.   But keep in mind that in order to do that 

China cheats on its currency, it manipulates its cost of 

production and we sit back and say that it would cost us jobs 

if we did the same thing.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Leo Gerard, thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  I just want to 

make the request to --  back on cell phones, if anybody still 

has their cell phone turned on as a result of the voting 

exercise, to turn it off now because I’ve been told it might be 

interfering with the radio waves might be interfering with some 

of the audio in the room.  So I’ll just listen to everybody’s 

phones sing for a second while that happens.  [PAUSE]  And 

again, for newcomers, I want to explain that we have opening 

statements of seven minutes each.  That will be followed by a 

round of head to head debate in which I’ll ask questions and 

you’ll ask questions.  And at the end of the evening we’ll have 

summary statements of two minutes each, after which you will 

vote once again.  Are all of the cell phones off?  It looks like 

they are.  To resume, the motion here is that Buy 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 15. 

 

 

 

American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire.  And our next 

debater is going to argue in the affirmative.  He thinks that 

Buy American will backfire, not surprisingly, because he is one 

of the world’s pre-eminent economists and has long argued 

that globalization is the world’s most powerful force for social 

good.  From Columbia University, Jagdish Bhagwati.   

JAGDISH BHAGWATI  

[APPLAUSE]  Thank you very much.  Let me just begin first by 

emphasizing a point which Doug Irwin made, but in relation to 

a story.  When I was a student at Oxford one of my professors 

actually told me that he’d gone to Whitehall to advise and he 

was surprised to find that while he thought economics 

oversimplified things, that in fact, people in Whitehall were 

working with even more simplistic models.  They usually 

thought X led to Y and they stopped there.  Y leading to Z, Z 

leading in turn to X.  All of that was completely beyond them.  

They were extremely oversimplifying.  The problem, I think, 

with Mr. Gerard is, I think, as Doug was pointing out, and with 

the opposing side basically, is that you think that Buy America 

will create jobs in the steel using sectors, for example, or in the 

steel industry.   

 

First, in fact, X affects Y.  But what does that do to the rest of 

the system?  Because you are then opening up a whole series 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 16. 

 

 

 

of additional effects which are actually going to overwhelm the 

initial primary impact.  And that’s essentially what we need to 

focus on.   What are these additional effects?  One, of course, 

is that downstream industries typically become more 

uncompetitive.  We know when President Bush put on the 

steel tariffs in ’92 the effect was, in fact, to price out a whole 

lot of steel using industries, including autos, which indeed, 

there was a famous study which shows that about two 

hundred thousand jobs may have been lost while we gained a 

few basically through protecting steel.  So that’s point number 

one.  The second point is that you get out of this, and still, 

even if we didn’t have this problem we would have the problem 

of retaliation.  And I would say it’s not tit for tat retaliation 

necessarily.  It’s also monkey see, monkey do kind of imitation.  

While we do something others do the same thing.   

 

If you look at the 1930s it was exactly spreading and diffusion 

of all kinds of trade barriers, starting out from the Smoot-

Hawley, et cetera.  And this, I think, led to essentially what we 

in economics call a nuclear winter, basically.  There was a 

chaotic outbreak of all kinds of trade barriers.  That came 

home to roost in turn, on our export performance, on 

everybody’s export performance.  And I think this is something 

we need to remember, that as we go into this, policies like Buy 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 17. 

 

 

 

America, that is what we are going to get into.  We already see 

that, as Doug was pointing out, in a variety of fields.  And I’m 

sure Susan will pick up that theme.  The large numbers of 

actual actions which we already see by way of diffusion of 

these kinds of tariffs.    

 

And we are actually the biggest traders in the world.  Every 

state has export industries.  I’ve been looking at that.  You 

have basically, therefore, a lot of your jobs at stake.  And those 

are going to outweigh the few jobs you may save through Buy 

America provisions.  I think this is, if you look at Buy America, 

if you know a little bit of history --  I know just a little bit and 

Doug knows much more --  but Buy America, when did it first 

get passed in this country?  It has to be in this country, 

obviously, if it was Buy America.  [LAUGHTER]   It was 1933, 

right after the Depression, the great [UNCLEAR].  And that’s 

what set the stage.  And I think we are now re-enacting that 

after this current crisis.  So beware, is all I say.  Caveat 

emptor, if you want, feel inclined to be working for the other 

side.  Then I think we also got the argument, to look at the 

negative arguments produced by Mr. Gerard in his interesting 

comment, he said, Well, manufacturers are important and we 

need to support them.  And he’s not the first one to have said 

that.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 18. 

 

 

 

 

There has been an anti-de-industrialization movement in 

England, about twenty years ago.  There was also a Berkeley 

movement called Manufacturing Matters.  And I think Mr. 

Gerard is really harking back to it.  And this is a case where 

you assert that manufacturing is some sort of massive 

externalities.  And I would simply say, I’ll just quote my old 

teacher, Professor Solow, who is Nobel Laureate and the father 

figure on the Democratic side.  I’m a Democrat.  He said, I 

know there are lots of industries in massive externalities.  But 

there’s a four dollar worth of marginal, social marginal product 

and the private margin product is one, one dollar.  And he 

said, My problem is I don’t know which ones they are.  And the 

problem is, and compounded by the fact that the lobbies know 

where the externalities are.  And I think this is the problem.   

 

It’s not that we don’t believe that there are externalities, but 

for Mr. Gerard to assume that they are necessarily in steel or 

in manufacturers more generally has never been proven.  And 

I don’t think any Democrat would support that view.  In fact, 

what we do is essentially to argue that we must support 

broader policies like R&D support and so on, but not go into 

specific activities cause that’s exactly the wrong way to go and 

it gets captured by, by several people.   And I think this is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 19. 

 

 

 

what we need to worry about.  Finally, I would just touch on 

one thing which drives, I think, the union movement.  And I 

can understand their fear because I can easily produce models 

being a theorist also, aside from an activist on these issues.  

One can easily produce models where international trade 

actually affects your workers, that in fact the fear is, on the 

part of unions, that trade with the poor countries produces 

paupers in the rich countries.   

 

Now, a lot of work has been done on this.  Actually, there’s 

very little evidence of this.  In fact, there are studies, including 

my own with Bob Lawrence at Harvard, which show actually 

that the pressure on our wages, which is a real problem and, 

you know, as a Democrat I’m entirely sympathetic to the 

problem.  That has been brought about by extremely acute 

labor saving technical change, by the fact that the unionization 

has also gone down for reasons which don’t have much to do 

with globalization or trade.  Given that, I think a lot of us have 

argued with empirical evidence that trade with poor countries, 

trade with emerging countries has actually kept the 

consumption cost of workers’ wages down.  So it, in fact, it has 

moderated the --

I want to help, ask you to help with a little piece of radio 

production.  At this point on the NPR broadcast they take a

very helpful if it’s refreshed with a round of applause from all of

back to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I’m John 

Donvan, your moderator.  The proposition we are debating here 

is:  Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire.  We have 

six panelists, three against three.  And next to speak against the 

motion:  Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire, 

John R. MacArthur, known as Rick.  He is President and 

Publisher of Harper’s magazine, the oldest continuously 

published monthly magazine in America and also one of the most 

progressive.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rick MacArthur.  

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN MACARTHUR 

I have totell you that I wrote a book about NAFTA, called The 

Selling of Free Trade.  That’s why I’m here, not because I’m 

publisher of Harper’s magazine.  But may I make a cheap 

debater’s point right at the outset [CHUCKLES] and say that 

Professor Irwin has already veered off the proposition.  This is a, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 21. 

 

 

 

the question I thought that was put was, Buy American policies, 

not the Buy American provision in the legislation that just passed 

six or eight months ago.  And if we’re going to discuss this 

broadly we have to talk about tariffs versus free trade, 

protectionism versus free trade.  That’s what we’re really talking 

about here.  I would also add that, I hope we can come back to 

Smoot-Hawley because Smoot-Hawley is a canard, as it is 

acknowledged by many, many mainstream economists who say 

that it had little or no affect on exacerbating the Great 

Depression.   

 

But there’s a reason why Thomas Carlyle called economics the 

dismal science.  I happen to think it’s because he understood 

intuitively that it was not a science, and that it’s not a science 

because you cannot conduct a controlled experiment in 

economics the way you can in hard science, in real science.  And 

as a non-science, we have to turn back to the great theorists of 

free trade and the anti-protectionists like David Ricardo and 

Richard Cobden and understand that they, in the early 19th 

Century, could not imagine a world where anybody with money 

and labor could plug into a power source anywhere in the world 

and make virtually anything.  These theorists, to whom Professor 

Bhagwati, Professor Irwin and many of their colleagues cling with 

religious fervor, with --   I might even say --  Marxist fervor, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 22. 

 

 

 

because Ricardo had a great influence on Marx, is what distorts 

the debate.   

 

As then MIT economist Paul Krugman, who was and still is a 

partisan of free trade, noted in a 1991 book called Geography and 

Trade, the quote:  The tendency of international economists to 

turn a blind eye to the fact that countries both occupy and exist 

in space, a tendency so deeply entrenched that we rarely even 

realize we are doing it, has, I would submit, had some serious 

costs.  These lie not so much in lack of realism --  all economic 

analysis is more or less unrealistic --  as in the exclusion of 

important issues, and above all, important sources of evidence.  

Now, let’s admit, on the protectionist side, that Buy American 

policies are indirect tariffs, indirect subsidies, whatever you want 

to call them.   

 

And there are many statistics to support the protectionist model.  

I don’t pretend they’re definitive any more than my economist 

friends can make the argument that their statistics or their 

studies are definitive because they’re not scientific experiments.   

But since we’re talking about protectionism versus free trade, 

essentially, we can site some spectacularly successful 

protectionist schemes, Mexico, poor, beleaguered, exploited 

Mexico in the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, had a program called import 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 23. 

 

 

 

substitution, a nice way of saying, or a technical way of saying, 

buy Mexican.   And Mexico enjoyed the highest growth rates in 

its history, through the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s, of, roughly, I think 

averaging about 7 percent.  Just to give you a more specific 

recent example, we still have a 25 percent tariff, import tariff on 

pickup trucks in the United States.  That’s why, Toyota, until 

very recently, was still manufacturing pickups at their NUMMI,  

joint operating plant in Fremont, California, in their joint 

operation with General Motors.  That’s what kept Toyota in the 

game, was the 25 percent tariff on imported pickups.  It’s 

probably not a coincidence that in 1945, the average US tariff on 

dutiable imports was 28 percent.  And in the same year, 

manufacturing employment which as you all knows pays better 

than working at Wal-Mart, manufacturing employment as a 

percentage of total US employment was 35 percent.   It’s also 

likely not a coincidence, that in 2008, the average tariff on 

dutiable imports was 4 percent—by the way these are Professor 

Irwin’s numbers— and in the same year manufacturing 

employment as a percentage of to—total US employment, was 

just under 10 percent.  Now.  Again, this is anecdotal evidence, I 

don’t pretend it’s scientific, but in 1979, the year in which 

manufacturing employment peaked in the United States, the 

median weekly earnings for all US workers in 2009 dollars, was 

$716.47.    In the second quarter of 2009, the median weekly 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 24. 

 

 

 

earnings for US workers, was $734, just slightly above, so  we 

can make the argument that a pro-free trade, lower-tariff 

economy has possibly contributed to the stagnation of wages,  I 

think we can say anecdotally, that because manufacturing 

employment has declined, and manufacturing jobs pay better 

than service jobs generally speaking, this has contributed to the 

stagnation of wages.  Now, this is not only happening in the,  

labor-intensive traditional assembly-line jobs.  Business Week 

just had a cover story called “America’s Manufacturing Crisis” in 

which they talked about, the crisis in high-tech manufacturing.  

And the causes of this manufacturing decline in American high-

tech, quote, “are numerous, complex, and a long time in the 

making.”   That’s from Willy Shih, a Harvard Business School 

professor who used to work at IBM, and used to run Eastman 

Kodak’s Digital Consumer Products Union.  And then, Business 

Week goes on, to paraphrase they say two decades of 

unconstrained outsourcing to Asia have hollowed out much of 

America’s base of supplies, factory managers, and skilled 

technicians.   US private capital markets meanwhile are loath to 

tie up their billions in factories and machinery.  In the boom 

years from 1994 to 1999, when then economy surged 26 percent, 

US manufacturing capacity went up by 44 percent.   Okay?  But 

from 2002 through 2007 when the US expanded by 17 percent,  

manufacturing capacity rose a paltry 5 percent.

JOHN DONVAN 

Rick MacArthur, your time’s up.   

JOHN MACARTHUR 

Okay.  And I’ll just say that, it’s no coincidence that permanent 

normal trade relations with China were passed, in 2000.   JOHN 

DONVAN  

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Our next debater Susan Schwab was to 

any of our international trading partners the face of US trade, 

holding as she did the post of United States Trade Representative 

in the George W. Bush administration, that is a Cabinet-level 

position.   She saw firsthand government thinking on trade and 

she also influenced it, and now at the University of Maryland, she 

is here to argue, that Buy American, Hire American policies will 

backfire, Susan Schwab.  [APPLAUSE]    

SUSAN SCHWAB 

Thank you, and thank you very much for inviting us here today 

to debate this very timely and very interesting and very 

complicated topic.  I’m going to start by talking about Hire 

American policies, which is part of this debate although no one’s 

talked about it yet and I’m going to make quick work of that, 

because quite frankly Hire American restrictions are un-

American.   They are discriminatory, they reek of discrimination, 

they deny us the very diversity that has made the United States, 

as competitive as we are.  Immigrants built this nation and all 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 26. 

 

 

 

you need to do is look at some of the companies that were 

founded by immigrants or children of immigrants the employ 

millions of Americans, including Google, Intel, eBay, Yahoo, 

Proctor and Gamble, duPont and even US Steel.  Buy American?  

Buy American sounds like motherhood and apple pie, and, 

unfortunately, Buy American policies hurt America, and hurt 

Americans.  And we have history to point to and we have, the fact 

that the United States has to export to grow, to point to, and the 

fact that the risk of retaliation is very, very real indeed, let’s start 

with history.   Rick mentioned Smoot-Hawley, well, guess what.  

In the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act we raised our tariffs, it was 

perfectly legal under the international trading system at the time.  

It ultimately prolonged and deepened the Great Depression.   No 

country, no country has ever reached or sustained a level of 

prosperity with economic isolationism as their policy, with trade 

protectionism as their policy, with buy national policies.  In fact if 

you look at the 1990s the countries that grew the fast in the 

1990s, were countries that opened their markets, followed our 

lead by the way, opening our markets.  They grew three times 

faster than the countries that did not open their markets.  95 

percent of the world’s population, meaning the world’s 

consumers, live outside of our borders.  Those are our customers 

and if anyone thinks that we Americans have enough money to 

buy our way to recovery, and to future competitiveness without 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 27. 

 

 

 

exports, you’ve got another thing coming.   Half of GDP growth, 

more than half of global GDP growth going forward over the next 

five years, will come in the advanced developing countries.  The 

bulk of global economic growth will come outside the United 

States.   And if you’re talking about stimulus packages and quite 

frankly, Rick, this debate is about Buy American policies, 

meaning the government telling us, that it will not buy foreign 

goods whether they are higher quality, whether they are better 

priced.  $3.5 trillion will be spent in the next several years, by 

other countries on stimulus.  Globally.  We need a piece of that.  

And if you are a Caterpillar worker in Illinois, if you work for 

G.E., if you work for any of the major manufacturers in the 

United States that sell to these countries, you want a part of that 

action.   China is going to be spending the vast majority of the 

$550 billion it’s putting into stimulus, on infrastructure.  That is 

business for American exporters.  India is going to be spending 

anywhere from $20-$70 billion in roads construction.   Now.  

This issue, this canard, of—that we don’t manufacture anything, 

is utterly absurd.  Some of you may be surprised to know that 

the United States remains the single biggest manufacturer in the 

world, bar none.   $1.7 trillion in manufacturing outputs, China 

is a distant second, at $1.3 trillion, with Japan and Germany 

following up to the rear.  One in six manufacturing jobs depends 

on exports, 6 million US jobs depend on manufactured good 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 28. 

 

 

 

exports.   And if you look at US economic growth you discover, 

that our manufacturing is in fact 20 percent of our GDP, not 9 

percent.  And it continues to grow, our manufacturing output.  

Yes, our manufacturing employment, because of productivity 

enhancements, technology, has not kept pace.   But if you look 

for example at a company like UPS that tells us for every 40 new 

packages that are shipped overseas, they hire a new American 

worker.  Those are high-paying blue-collar jobs, Fed Ex, exactly 

the same kind of statistics.  And in many cases you’re talking 

about, these are Teamsters who are going to be hired.  

Retaliation, retaliation is not some myth, retaliation is very, very 

real, not only did we see it after…Smoot-Hawley, we saw it after 

the Buy American language, it is not coincidence, that within six 

weeks of the Buy American legislature on the stimulus package 

moving through the United States Congress, it is not coincidence 

that the Chinese suddenly decided to let their provinces favor 

local companies, because before that a lot of Americans were 

starting to make a lot of money in those markets.  We need 

access to those markets, and we need to be exporting to stay 

competitive.  The folks who are telling us, this isn’t going to 

happen, they are ignoring the fact that the Canadians have 

already retaliated, the Chinese have already retaliated.   The US 

Chamber of Commerce estimates that for every 1 percent of this 

global stimulus bonanza that is out there, that we lose because of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 29. 

 

 

 

retaliation, we lose 175,000 jobs.   That eclipses the, what, eight, 

9,000 jobs that the Petersen Institute has told us could possibly 

be created in the steel industry in the United States, and Doug 

has already talked about how that has hurt other workers in 

construction and so on.   So let me close…as follows.  One, 

remind you, there is zero evidence that buy national policies 

create more jobs than they sacrifice, and in fact the data is very, 

very compelling the other way, trade isolationism kills jobs, it 

does not create jobs.   Buy American sounds good.  And the 

issues that are being raised by the other side in many ways are 

legitimate issues.  But Buy American policies and trade 

isolationism will not solve any one of the problems that they are 

describing.  Buy American sounds good, good sound bite, bad 

policy, hurts America, hurts American jobs, thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

And finally, speaking against the motion, “Buy American-Hire 

American Policies Will Backfire,” Jeff Madrick, a business 

journalist and visiting professor at the Cooper Union, in the mid-

1990s he predicted The End of Affluence with a bestseller that 

went by that very name.   His latest book, The Case for Big 

Government—the title alone tells you much about his political 

take on the world, as he argues now against the motion, ladies 

and gentlemen, Jeff Madrick.

[APPLAUSE]   

JEFF MADRICK 

Thank you, thank you, I’m delighted to be here.  I was once a 

free-trader myself, as was Philip Verlager who I see had a letter in 

the New York Times just Sunday saying he was once a free-

trader.  Worked for the Petersen Institute, decided it was totally 

unrealistic.   Enough is enough.  I’m a little tired of people who 

keep telling us—not these people.  [LAUGHTER]  That wasn’t 

aimed at you, that, uh—  [LAUGHTER]   [00:59:23:25]  Little tired 

of being told time and again, that being worried about free trade 

is an oversimplified point of view.  I’m a little tired of being given 

simplistic examples, of where buying, say, steel in the US, will 

raise construction costs and therefore cost American jobs.   I’m 

tired of being told that empirical studies invariably show that free 

trade will create—has almost no effect on jobs in the US, and you 

know I better tell you the truth about that, because, I have a 

whole bunch of things to say, I’m not going to get to them, and 

I’m going to forget some.   The fact of the matter is, despite what 

Professor Bhagwati said, and despite his own studies, most 

studies find a direct negative impact, from free trade on wages, 

and on the creation of jobs.  Most studies.   Not by wide-eyed 

progressives from the New School, but by mainstream 

economists.  Most studies, so let’s get the facts straight.  I want 

to go down this list because this is too important, I’m afraid, to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 31. 

 

 

 

leave to economic theorists.  I believed in Ricardian economics, I 

still do.  Exchange is the key to economic growth.  You have 

something I want, I want something—I have something you want.  

It leads to economic growth, but it is a narrow idealistic theory, in 

a very complex world.   First, Buy America is not illegal.  China 

agreed to the very terms we are citing in this stimulus bill.  That’s 

number one.  It is not illegal, neither by the way are the tariffs on 

tires.  Not illegal, they agreed to it, in the international 

agreements.   Number two.  The fiscal policy becomes necessarily 

ineffective when 20 to 30 to 40 percent of every dollar we spend, 

to pump up our economy in a recessionary emergency, leaks 

overseas.  We’re not saying all—we should not have exports and 

imports, nobody on my teams thinks we shouldn’t have export 

growth, and even import growth.   Nobody I know believes that.  

But we do want effective fiscal policy and that is what we are 

talking about in the narrow sense.  Will there be a trade war?  

Darn it, I am tired of these scare tactics, I’m tired of claiming 

there will be a repeat of the 1930s.   Is China up in arms against 

this policy, I suspect China is now willing to talk a little bit, 

because they see maybe President Obama is ever so slightly 

serious about imposing rights he was given in international 

treaties into which China agreed.   Is China not pushing its tires, 

a surge in tires here?  Of course they are.  And that was a 

response, another issue.  Let’s stop isolating this economic theory 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 32. 

 

 

 

from the real world.  China subsidizes, all kinds of countries 

subsidize, all kinds of countries push exports.  We have to begin 

to realize that.  Let’s look at what’s happened, and I’m skipping 

as you can tell a little bit, let’s look at what’s happened in 

America since free trade.  Don’t think this side of the podium is 

fighting an uphill battle.  They won.  They’ve won for decades.   

Tariffs have come down significantly.  And where does America 

stand in terms of wages, you’d think, judging by what some of 

them said, we’re doing great.  The median male worker in 

America today, makes less than the median male worker after 

inflation did in the 1970s.   Think about that.  That stagnation 

probably never occurred in American economic history before.  

We did some numbers on this, it’s pretty stun— I’m not going to 

go into those because, my time is running low, maybe we’ll get to 

it in the Q-and-A.   Frank Levy, and Peter Temin, mainstream 

economists, at MIT, are alarmed, that annual earnings of all 

workers, not just males, male and female, all races, all 

ethnicities, plus fringe benefits, which people often say are left 

out by—people like Robert Lawrence often make this case—plus 

fringe benefits haven’t been keeping up with productivity since 

roughly the late 1970s.   Wages are supposed to keep up with 

productivity.  What’s going on, is free trade part of this?  I think it 

is part of it.  Is it all of it, no, is it most of it, it may not even be 

most of it.  But it’s probably some of it and we’ve gotta start 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 33. 

 

 

 

thinking about that.   I have to say one other thing about 

economic theory while I’m going through this litany.  There is a 

very strong emphasis on keeping wages down in America, you 

may have noticed, every time wages go up the Federal Reserve in 

the good old days, that was before the crisis, would try to push 

wages down because it was going to be inflationary.   A very 

important theory of why economies grow, has been thrown aside.  

That is economies grow because American workers, and the 

immigrant workers who come to America make enough money to 

support demand so the companies can grow.   And then 

companies invest.  All through American history, wages rose 

inexorably.  In America, median wages, average wages, rose, and 

were a source of economic growth.  That stopped somewhere in 

the 1970s.   And we better start thinking about it, what am I 

thinking, what am I talking about?  Not full-scale protectionism, 

not the end of exports and imports.  But a serious, committed, 

complex…not simple theory, of why economies grow, but a 

complex analysis and approach to dealing with a high dollar.   

With high debt in America.  With trade inequalities.  With 

industrial policies and export subsidies overseas.  And an 

attempt, and I think interestingly, the other side did not use its 

strongest argument.  Free trade, our buying from overseas, helps 

those poor countries, where wages are really low.   I think as 

decent human beings we should all be for them, look what’s

temptation to make long speeches.   And if you are a member of 

the press, we would prefer that you identify yourself.  Doug Irwin 

of Dartmouth College, you are arguing for the motion that Buy 

American will backfire, you actually went as far as saying it has 

already backfired.   I heard your opponent on the other side, Rick 

MacArthur, and his colleagues, argue repeatedly that Buy 

American works, and buy our own stuff works for lots of other 

countries who are doing it already, that’s why they do it.   Rick 

MacArthur cited Mexico, it has worked for Mexico.  If it works for 

Mexico, why not make the argument that it works here as well.  

DOUGLAS IRWIN 

Well I wouldn’t Grant the premise that it worked for Mexico, in 

fact, what did that lead to.  Huge debt crisis in 1982, huge 

collapse of the growing middle class, huge economic problems 

which is one reason why they chose to embrace economic 

openness after the early 1980s.   But actually, Jeff Madrick 

raised an important point too.  There’s been tremendous 

economic growth in India.  Tremendous economic growth in 

China.  The biggest change in the globe has been happening in 

those regions, where there’s hundreds of millions of people 

moving into the middle class.  They’re able to do that because of 

trade openness.  And yes—    

LEO GERARD 

They’re able to do that because it’s a mercantilist policy, Doug.

Oh, so China—    

LEO GERARD 

They’re able to do that because they subsidize their market, 

they’re able to do that because they manipulate their currency.  

They’re able to do that because of the article that the CEO of—

Chinese CEO of Suntech Power says that they’re going to sell 

their products in America, at lower than the cost of production.

JOHN DONVAN 

I’m glad Leo Gerard of the Steelworkers Union jumped in because 

one of the points that was raised by your opponents, as you 

argue against this motion, that Buy American will backfire, they 

raise the argument that, steel products from abroad may be 

better and may be cheaper, and why should Americans have to 

pay more for their steel if they can get it better and cheaper 

abroad.    

LEO GERARD 

Well, first of all it’s certainly not better and in some cases it is 

cheaper, but I come back to the point that Doug raised about the 

Bay Bridge.  We have red lead in steel, that we’ve had to ship 

back because, we banned red lead in America 30 years ago 

because of its health hazards.  So we—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Could—can you explain what that is for people that don’t know 

the term, very quickly—   

LEO GERARD 

Red lead is the most toxic form of lead, they used to be put in 

pipes because it’s malleable.  You can maneuver it.  We banned it 

because red lead is so dangerous.  And we pay a price for doing 

that, we pay a price for clean water, we pay a price for all those 

things in the kind of society that we want.   We found that China 

was shipping steel pipes with radiation in it because they were 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S.

doing it from melted pipes with radioactive material in it, and 

shipping it.  We found that, as I said this, and I…    

JOHN DONVAN  

But that—that’s an argument that you can buy junky stuff 

abroad.   

LEO GERARD 

Well, that—   

JOHN DONVAN 

And,—   

LEO GERARD 

—well that’s—but Doug, there are, that’s the argument, that we 

have a set of laws and rules and we’re a rules-based trading 

system, but we’re the only one right now playing by the rules.  

DOUGLAS IRWIN 

You know, I—   

LEO GERARD 

And, and if we’re a rules-based trading system they ought to be 

playing by the rules too—

Let me hear from the side for the motion in response to that.

SUSAN SCHWAB  

I got that.  No, I mean the point is, we can get off on this long 

tangent about Chinese trade policies, first of all, that is not the 

issue at hand.  The resolution talks about Buy American policies, 

Hire American policies, will backfire.   They will backfire, they 

have backfired, that’s what we’re voting about.  But in terms of 

China, I have taken on Chinese trade practices, and we’ve got 

legislation to do that.  We took six cases against the Chinese in 

the Bush administration, we won or settled every one of those 

cases, got rid of illegal Chinese subsidies,  we managed to get the 

markets where they were artificially closing them.

Dumping goes on, subsidies go on in this recession, by all reports 

I’ve heard.  China is really pushing out the exports as, uh, uh, 

as, and some of the practices are open, this is part of what I 

mean—  This is what I’m talking about about this 

oversimplification.   That, and I have great respect for…Jagdish 

who I consider a friend, but, to say that we can handle these 

issues in the International Labor Organization, or through 

agreements we make with China, disregarding the reality of the 

world, I am—we’re not even close to fighting a trade war.   The, 

we’re—it’s not even close.  China needs us, we need them, we’ve 

got to start dealing with the reality of what’s happened to wages 

in America.  And Doug, things have become extremely 

imbalanced in this world you’re describing of China and India—

DOUGLAS IRWIN  

I’m actually one of the few trade economists who believes the 

trade deficit has become a problem.  So the question is how do 

you deal with it.  Buy American will not deal with it, it’s not the 

right approach.   Why do we have a huge trade deficit with China.  

What do we do with our dollars in the United States.  70 percent 

of US GDP is consumption.  70 percent.  What is the share of 

consumption in China.  30 percent.   They are a high-savings 

country, we are a low-savings country.  We are a high-

consumption country, they’re a low-consumption country.  That 

is the ultimate source—

JOHN MACARTHUR  

Well [LAUGHS], I never got to— I ran outta time so I wasn’t able 

to make my main argument which has to do with what kind of a 

country you want to live in.  Obviously, using tariffs and Buy 

American provisions are artificial methods that you install in an 

economy to, we hope, maintain wages at a relatively high level so 

we can run a civilized society, we haven’t had one exchange yet 

about the exploitation of cheap labor in China or Mexico.   And 

when I talk about when I have arguments with my friends in the 

economics departments of these various universities, I have to 

ask myself if they’ve ever met a factory worker, have they ever 

talked to a steelworker or to an autoworker or to an electrical 

worker who’s lost their job, because the United States has been 

pursuing pro-buy foreign policies for the last 15 years, that’s 

what we have now with NAFTA, and the Permanent Normal Trade 

Relations with China.   These are, as Professor Bhagwati will be 

the first to acknowledge, preferential trade agreements, not free 

trade agreements, and, something has to be done on our side to 

compensate for these tremendous advantages, given to foreign 

manufacturers.  Yes, some of it is low-end manufacturing but not 

all of it is low-end manufacturing.  And in order to redress this 

tremendous trade imbalance there are various methods at our 

disposal.  Tariffs, Buy American provisions, et cetera, et cetera.   

But to go on talking as if there is a free trade system in place 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 45. 

 

 

 

that’s being threatened is preposterous.  If you look at NAFTA 

and PNTR they’re much closer, and this is a corporate lawyer who 

first explained it to me when I explained to him how the labor 

market works between the United States and Mexico and the 

United States and China, it’s more like a labor racketeering 

agreement.  That is a conspiracy to fix the price of labor as low as 

possible, certainly to benefit certain, uh, shareholders in certain 

American corporations, but not to benefit American workers or to 

defend—

Well, let us note again, you’re going to come back and remind 

everyone what this debate is actually supposed to be about, Buy 

American, Hire American.  But, the other side is meandering, I 

want to go in that direction and talk about trade agreements 

because what Rick has been saying about trade agreements, just 

isn’t borne out by the facts.   If you look at the free trade 

agreements, and, forgive me, Jagdish, I know you hate free trade 

agreements.  If you look at the agreements that we’ve negotiated, 

you find that US exports to our trade agreement partners have 

gone up 40 percent faster, than our—

trade agreements that we negotiated during the Bush 

administration US exports have gone up 80 percent faster to 

those countries than the rest of the world.  NAFTA.  NAFTA was 

raised, this—I know this debate’s not about NAFTA, but—  And I 

didn’t negotiate NAFTA, NAFTA went through during the Clinton 

administration.  But you know what?  If you look at the statistics 

in the 10 years before NAFTA and the 10 years after, you

surge in exports from United States to Mexico are fake exports, 

it’s us sending components to Mexico for assembly, and we’re 

counting those as exports and they come right back into the 

United States for sale.   We’re even at the point now where we’re, 

we’re sending oranges to Mexico to be packed, and then shipped 

back into the United States, we’re calling those exports, they’re 

fake exports, they’re not—there’s no added value to speak of in 

those exports.   And the people who used to do those assembly 

jobs, those relatively low-paid assembly jobs, have lost their jobs.  

More than half a million, probably a million if we count honestly,

since NAFTA was passed, and this is a government statistic.   So, 

instead of having somebody making $10 an hour or $11 an hour 

packing oranges in Florida, it’s now being packed for $1.30 an 

hour in Mexico, we’re counting that as an export when it’s not an 

export.

Two—couple of quick points.  And I could give Susan the point 

that our exports have gone up, but our imports, more than 

doubled.   So we—when we signed—we could do NAFTA.  When 

we signed NAFTA we had a slight trade surplus with Mexico.  10 

years after NAFTA we’ve had record trade deficits year after year 

with Mexico.  When we did PNTR trade with China was relatively 

in balance, only a couple of hundred million dollars either way.   

We’re now setting record trade deficit with China, China’s trade 

deficit year over year, is 70 percent of our overall trade deficit.

percent of its yearly production, would run us out of the whole 

mark—of the whole Colombian market.   So we think that it’s 

dangerous for us, and we think that the policy of subsidies does 

exist in the United States which it doesn’t in Colombia, and as

The Colombia-US free trade agreement was, uh, signed over two 

years ago, three— close to three years ago now.   It would benefit 

both countries, the independent International Trade Commission 

has told us that US exports would go up to Colombia, Colombia’s 

exports would go up to the United States.   In fact, because 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S.

Colombia has preferential access to the US market now, US 

exports would go up to Colombia even faster than Colombia’s 

exports to the United States, but Colombia would derive new 

foreign direct investment.   We made all of these arguments on 

Capitol Hill.  The Democratic leadership reached an agreement 

with the Democratic leadership in 2007 to add special labor and 

environmental protections to that agreement, after it had been 

signed and was very grateful that the government of Colombia 

was willing to incorporate that in the agreement.   And lo and 

behold, the Democratic leadership in the Congress decided they 

just didn’t want to move the legislation.  And a legislative process 

that has worked for the United States since 1974, was turned on 

its head, when the Speaker of the House refused to allow a vote 

on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement when we knew the votes 

were there, in the House and in the Senate to pass it.

It— we apparently have a—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—gentleman in the white shirt, please.  Right behind you?   

AUDIENCE MEMBER (male) 

I’ll try and keep it short.  I believe that America’s a capitalist 

country, and capitalism rewards people who are more efficient, 

and people who can give you more for less.  So, if these foreign 

countries can produce steel, like Pasco in Korea can produce 

steel better than US Steel or Nucor can, then why are we going to 

reward mediocrity, why are we going to reward the inefficiency of 

the American system, when we can get—when we should get 

incentives to the American companies to become as efficient as 

these foreign companies—   

LEO GERARD 

Who—  [APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN 

Let’s give that question to the Leo Gerard of the steelworkers—

LEO GERARD 

The problem with that question, is it’s living in facts that were 

probably from the 1970s and early ‘80s.  And the fact is—   

AUDIENCE MEMBERS 

[DIN OF PROTEST]   

LEO GERARD 

—the—well…  By the time we got to the economic collapse of last 

fall, last year…American steel was the cheapest of any major 

industrial country and American steel sold in America, was 

cheaper than Chinese steel sold in China.  And the reason for 

that is that China doesn’t have sufficient raw material.  But 

China went…think about this if we talk about a sort of a level 

playing field.  From two thousand and three, roughly late 2002, 

to 2007, China went from being able to produce 150 million tons 

of steel, to 500 million tons of steel.   In a traditional system 

using traditional finance, they could’ve never generated enough 

profits and they could’ve never accessed enough capital markets 

to make that kind of investment to do that to their industry, in a 

period of roughly five years.   That was done because they got 

subsidies, they got cheap money, they got free land, they got no 

enforcement, they got free transportation, they got export 

subsidies, when they exported stuff to us they got the money 

back, and they generated that, and it’s a mercantilist system, I’m 

not angry at China—

—at usually the state and local level.  They are up to huge 

amounts, people like Mayor Bloomberg even announced with 

great glee that we managed to attract industry to New York, and 

all the governors compete for it also.  So I think actually, we don’t 

have clean hands either, so you know, for us to say, others are

We’re at NYU at the moment that happens to have a very modern 

little faculty, with global faculty, global students.  And I think 

they know something.  America is a big, complex influential 

place.  It’s the epicenter of financial crisis, it’s in the middle of 

political and social change.   And I think America needs to tell it 

to the world.  I was wondering if the opposition have admitted

JEFF MADRICK 

The point is that we—America is responsible for much of that 

credit crisis, because it believed in free-market theory.  Now, free 

trade theory, is a precise analogy to efficient market financial 

theory.  It argues that all these markets in the world work very 

efficiently like this fellow has said.  If Korea makes something 

efficiently why shouldn’t we reward them.   Well, their wages are 

very low, but are they making something, are there more 

incentives, should we have an incentive battle?  So, are we—do 

we argue that, trade is good?  I think all three of us argue that 

trade is good.   Do we argue that it’s become unbalanced, that 

this is tipped over far too much, that evidence of wages in 

America doing so poorly, is clear.  That’s what I—

Which is that there are people, who could be employed but who 

are kind of at the bottom end, they’re not really comparable to 

the kinds of people we are going out and getting.  And so I think 

the nation prospers by having those people come in, create jobs, 

because it’s not a given number of jobs that we are talking about.

Yes.  Let’s stipulate that the effect of impeding lower-cost goods, 

is higher prices for goods, tires, pickup trucks, et cetera, in fact 

that is the purpose of protectionist policies on their face is to, 

prop up prices, in turn, propping up wages.  What is the—and 

this is the three gentleman on that side.  What is the ethical—

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 75. 

 

 

 

inarguably the cost of im— the effect of impeding lower-cost 

imports.    

LEO GERARD 

The problem with your question, I’ll keep it short so that the 

others can get a chance.   

JOHN DONVAN 

This is Leo Gerard speaking.    

LEO GERARD 

The problem with your question is you don’t get to the point of 

how did we so-called end up with lower cost.  If we end up 

instead of paying a living wage we’re paying less than a living 

wage, if we’re giving cheap money and extra subsidies, if we’re 

giving tax dollars to export credits when they export,  if we’re not 

enforcing safety standards, if we’re not enforcing environmental 

standards, you could send me anywhere and give me those rules 

and I can develop the cheapest product.  But what’s the moral 

right.  And in this case what we’ve been doing, what we are doing 

today, is we’re taking American dollars, and we’re sending them 

to…   [We’ve spent a lot of time on China but it could be India or 

could be Mexico, it could be somewhere else.  We’re taking those 

American dollars and we’re sending ‘em over there, and they’ve 

cheated and haven’t played by the rules in a rules-based trading 

system that the three of us are arguing for, and they’re sending 

us back their products and their products are knocking our

workers out of work.  There’s a moral wrong being done there but 

it’s not by taxpayer dollars.    

JEFF MADRICK  

That is the same kind of argument—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jeff Madrick—  

JEFF MADRICK  

—that was used against labor unionization, throughout American 

economic history.  [BRIEF APPLAUSE]  What is the ethical 

argument for raising wages above some supposed, and I would 

argue hypothetical market rate of wages.   The fact is, the 

assumption behind—and I see you smiling there.  The 

assumption, behind your comment is that these markets work 

very well, reflect cost, that people without labor unions to 

continue that analogy, will always get what they’re worth, and 

everybody will do well.  It’s just not unfortunately the way it 

works, it works maybe in your classroom.  But it doesn’t work in 

the real world, and along—

speaker.  Each speaker has a short summary statement.  It’s 

their last chance to change your minds.  Our motion, once again, 

is:  Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire.  And 

speaking against our motion and summing up, Leo Gerard, 

International President of the United Steel Workers.  Leo.   

LEO GERARD   

My point is... [APPLAUSE]  My point will be very brief.  That 

during the period of time that we’ve adopted the philosophy that 

the other side is defending – and you can’t defend that without 

talking about the issues of trade overall.  And during the period 

of time that we’ve entered into that blind drive to that kind of a 

trade and investment ideology and manufacturing, America has 

gone from being the world's largest creditor nation to the world’s 

largest debtor nation.  Wages of average Americans have 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 78. 

 

 

 

stagnated and fallen, that the industrial strength of America has 

gone from being sapped, uh, at twenty-eight percent at one time, 

now down to nine percent.   

 

We’ve had an accumulated trade debt that no one on the other 

side has tried to defend, of six and a half trillion dollars.  Some of 

you in the room may know what a billion is.  How many of you 

know what a trillion is?   Think about this:  A billion seconds is 

roughly the nineteen...late 1950s.  A billion minutes ago, Christ 

was on earth.  A billion hours ago we lived in caves.  And in the 

period since 1994 we’ve accumulated a six and a half trillion 

dollar trade debt.   We’ve hollowed out our economy to the point 

now where you’ve got the Chinese will probably raise at the G20 

whether or not we should move to another form of currency 

because the American dollar is not sustainable.  I think that the 

way we do that is we develop a strategy that’s going to rebuild the 

American industrial base and we have to do that by focusing, not 

just on subsidies but innovation, creativity and demanding that 

our trading partners level the playing field.  And we’re not going 

to be able to win against unfair trade and we shouldn’t pretend 

we can.

American Policies Will Backfire, here is Douglas Irwin, Professor 

of Economics at Dartmouth College.    

DOUGLAS IRWIN   

Well, first of all, just in terms of the proposition before the house,  

I think they have backfired.  I think that’s demonstrable.  I think 

you have no choice but to vote affirmative.  But let me make 

some major concessions to the other side.  I think what you’re 

hearing is things we’ve heard in the 1980s.  We’ve actually even 

heard them in the 1950s and beforehand --  and that is that 

economic change is very hard and very painful and we should do 

something to address that.   I happen to think that the remedies 

they’re suggesting are wrong, will backfire and actually don’t 

really address the underlying problem.  We’ve talked about the 

declining share of workers in manufacturing.  Manufacturing is a 

victim of its own success.  A century ago a third of the work force 

in the United States was in agriculture.  Now it’s about two 

percent.  Why?  Because the productivity of the American farmers 

is absolutely astronomical.  The same thing has happened with 

American factories.  They’re churning out stuff and we just need 

fewer workers.  They’re much more capital intensive as 

productivity.  Think about Manchester, New Hampshire.  I’m 

from New Hampshire.  If you’ve ever been to visit Manchester --  

lovely city, huge brick building, over a mile long, former textile 

mill.  Not a single shoe, not a single textile made there anymore.

It’s a thriving city.   

 

It wasn’t always thriving and it went through some very difficult 

times.  But it made that change.  It had to.  The jobs actually 

were stolen by the south, not by a foreign country.  And then they 

left for the south for other countries. Jeff Madrick said, You 

know, I’m tired of hearing about people saying trade doesn’t, you 

don’t lose jobs.  Actually, I’ll give you a copy of my book, because 

in one of the chapters I say, First thing, trade destroys jobs. 

Trade also creates jobs.  But there’s no denying that trade 

destroys jobs and certainly in poor, competing industries.  But it 

creates jobs elsewhere.  The question is the balance.  Guess 

what?  Technology destroys jobs.  What’s happened to all the 

bank tellers?  [APPLAUSE]  What’s happened to all the 

secretaries?  Do we stop technology?  No, we have to adjust to it 

and become a better society for it.  I do believe the trade deficit is 

a problem.  But it’s not mercantilism of China or what have you.  

China is very poor but their savings rate...What was the personal 

savings rate in the United States?

Summarizing against the motion that:  Buy American/Hire 

American Policies Will Backfire, John R. MacArthur, known as 

Rick MacArthur, President and Publisher of Harper’s magazine.   

JOHN MACARTHUR 

Very quickly, there are lots of anecdotal examples of de-

automation in outsourcing, by the way, Professor Irwin, where 

products that used to be made on automated assembly lines in 

the United States are now being made by hand in Mexico and 

China.  But I’ll put that aside and just say that I finally get to my 

main point, and get away from the statistics, and point out to you 

that Japan and China don’t believe in free trade any more than I 

do.  And if we don’t start buying American soon or doing 

something, installing some kind of compensatory tariffs, Buy 

American provisions --  and I’ll acknowledge to the other side that 

the tariff such as it is has been corruptly applied throughout the 

decades and the centuries that we’ve had it.  But that generally 

speaking, there has to be some kind of compensation for 

American policy that has favored the production of things that 

used to made here by cheap labor in foreign countries where you 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Squared U.S. 

 Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire Page 82. 

 

 

 

cannot organize a union and you have no Environmental 

Protection Agency.   

 

But even if you don’t feel an ethical obligation to your fellow 

citizens or to the poor workers working for thirty cents an hour in 

China or a dollar twenty-five an hour in Mexico, even if you have 

no concern, ethical concern about them, I urge you to come over 

to our side, vote for our side out of enlightened self-interest.  

Because if we don’t do something to compensate for these pro-

cheap labor, pro-outsourcing policies we’ve been pursuing for the 

last twenty years particularly --  but really since the war -- we’re 

going to end up with a political vacuum that will be filled not by a 

nice, civilized businessman like Ross Perot, but by a very ugly 

rightwing populist.  It’s already brewing in the United States.  

And if you don’t hurry up and do something about it, there won’t 

be any discussion about free trade anymore.  There’s going to be 

only discussion about how to shut the doors to immigration and 

how to keep the labor unions from organizing immigrants, for 

example.

Let me first focus on Buy American provisions because that’s 

really what the motion is about.  And there I would just simply 

say that while immediately you see that you’re saving some jobs, 

you’re losing many more because of the downstream effects, 

retaliation effects, diffusion or protectionism effects.  By the time 

you’ve added it up, you’re losing far more than you’re gaining.  

And I think it’s just being penny wise and pound foolish.  And 

that’s the fundamental point we need to understand. The second 

point relates to the more general issue of protectionism which 

has come up from the other side.  I think certainly, Mr. Gerard, 

and I think to some extent, the other people on the other side, 

have been focusing on the fear that trade has actually putting 

downward pressure on the wages of our workers.  As a Democrat, 

I’m certainly concerned about it and I think most people are 

concerned about it.  I mean, these are the bottom thirty percent 

of our society and we ought to worry about them.  The only 

question is whether protectionism is the answer.  And I think 

what is going on basically is that massive technological change is 

going on, and I think we need to worry about that and how to 

adapt to that.  And if we don’t do that we’re not going to get an,

appropriate answer to the problem.    

 

You take acute technological change going on assembly lines.  

Entire assembly lines are wiped out.  If you’re going to see, you 

know, take your child to see Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times and 

they say that he goes berserk on the assembly line and they say, 

Can you take me to see an assembly line?  Well, you can but you 

won’t see Charlie Chaplin there.  You will see five people in a cage 

up there.  So what has happened is that large numbers of jobs 

have been lost and you’re getting more volatility as a result, for 

the unskilled workers.  And we have to really rethink the whole 

issue of how we accommodate the institutional change to be able 

to support workers, but protectionism is not the answer.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  Summarizing his position 

against our motion, Jeff Madrick, Senior Fellow at the Schwartz 

Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School.  Jeff 

Madrick.   

JEFF MADRICK 

Thank you.  The first narrow motion, Buy American/Hire 

American will not have a reverse impact.  It’s a rather small 

issue.  What it will do is allow our stimulus to work effectively.  

That is our first priority.  The way it’s now structured, our 

stimulus to get ourselves out of this recession, will leak badly

overseas.  That’s the principle issue.  The opposition has talked 

about how it will inevitably cost jobs that use simple, people over 

there think it will save jobs in the near term.  But if you thought 

about it for a second or two you’d realize there are second, third 

and fourth order effects.  The fact is that both theory and most 

empirical studies suggest that more jobs are lost than the 

opposition is acknowledging.  In fact, on balance the theory says 

a significant portion of jobs or wages are lost in this kind of 

situation.   

 

In balance, the whole wage package may be higher but the 

distribution of those wages changes.  Now, free market theory is 

very compelling.  It is a simple and pretty ideology.  For the most 

part, the opposition has put forward this theory.  And I think, 

judging by some of the questions, many of you believe it out there 

--  that efficient markets exist.  I’m a little surprised I hear so 

much out there, given the financial crisis because we were told 

time and again that bonuses made sense, that securitization 

made sense, that even some people --  like Alan Greenspan, and 

to some degree, Ben Bernanke --  told us high house prices make 

sense.  They resorted to the same kind of thinking that is behind 

this idea that we just let markets work and sort it out.  The way 

to respond to change is through active government working with 

business, active incentives.  And this kind of argument has

diminished our ability to do that in America.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Jeff Madrick.  [APPLAUSE]  And finally, speaking for 

the motion:  Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire, 

here is Susan Schwab, former U.S. trade representative.   

SUSAN SCHWAB 

But the other side has sort of been bobbing and weaving about 

the topic on the debate.  So I’m forced to address just a couple of 

issues here on the ethics of open trade.  The fact that there have 

been six hundred million people brought out of poverty in China 

and India, in part because they have opened their markets over 

the last two decades, I think is a very strong positive note, how 

important trade can be and they’re potential new customers of 

ours.  We remain the single largest manufacturer in the world.  

We want to be selling those turbines, those earth movers, that 

transportation equipment, the aircraft.  It’s very, very important.   

 

And we care as much about U.S. jobs as the other side.  However, 

not a single solitary one of the arguments that they have made 

would create a single job.  And in fact, if you look at the 

proposition here, the proposition here would destroy --  Buy 

American/Hire American policies we have been able to show, 

without question --  would destroy more jobs than it would 

create.  It sounds patriotic.  In fact, Buy American/Hire American

policies hurt America, hurt Americans.  There is zero evidence of 

any country ever using economic isolationism and buy national 

policies to achieve and sustain economic development.  Someone 

mentioned Japan.  I remember twenty years ago, thirty years ago 

these same folks were telling us the Japanese were going to wipe 

out all our manufacturing.  We are still, by far, the largest 

manufacturer in the world.   We are the largest exporter in the 

world.  There are millions of U.S. jobs that depend on these 

exports and that includes exports that we can and should and 

will be making to foreign countries that have stimulus packages.   

Clearly, the vote has to be on which side has convinced you that 

the policies will create more jobs and more opportunities for 

Americans.  Clearly, that is a vote in the alternative because Buy 

American policies have and have already failed.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Susan Schwab.  [APPLAUSE]  And that concludes the 

debating portion of our program.  It is now time to learn who has 

won this debate.  We want to ask you to take out your cell 

phones again and turn them on, briefly.  It works the same way 

as before.   You text to the number 99503.  For the motion you 

vote IQYES.  If you’re against the motion you vote IQNO.  If you 

remain undecided or became undecided, you vote 

IQUNDECIDED.  And I’ll give you a couple of minutes cause I 

hear the phones just starting up.  [PAUSE]   The instructions are

clear to everyone, I assume.  Yeah.  [PAUSE]  Is anyone not done?  

All right, a lot of people still.  Okay.  [PAUSE]  What’s happening?  

It says you already voted?  [PAUSE]  Is anyone else having that 

problem, that it’s coming back to you that you voted already?  

[PAUSE]  Sorry?  [BACKGROUND VOICES]  It said to call back, 

leave a message?  [LAUGHTER]  [BACKGROUND VOICES]  Yeah.  

[PAUSE]   All right, and if you can shut your cell phones down 

again.  To the individuals --  and I think it’s just a few --  for 

whom it’s glitching, we apologize.  We will smooth it out.  [PAUSE]  

Okay?  So Dana, I’m assuming we’re locking it out?  Okay.  

Voting is over.  So we’re going to have the vote in just a moment.  

But before we do so, first of all, once again, this was a very zesty 

conversation.  I really want to thank both, [LAUGHTER]  

[APPLAUSE]  both of our panels.  [APPLAUSE]   

 

Looking forward as series four continues, I want to point out that 

our next debate will be next month --  Tuesday, October 6th.  The 

motion will be:  America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in 

Afghanistan and Pakistan.  We are still booking this,. and here’s 

who we have booked so far:  Panelists for the motion are retired 

U.S. Military Intelligence and Army Special Forces Officer Patrick 

Lang and Ralph Peters, a retired Army Officer and author; 

against the motion are President of the New America Foundation 

and author of The Bin Ladens, Steve Coll.  And he is one of the

authors of the U.S. Army’s Counterinsurgency Field Manual, 

Retired Officer and President of the Center for a New American 

Century, John Nagl and former Assistant Secretary of Defense for 

Asia, James Shin.  All of our debates will continue to be heard on 

more than a hundred and ninety NPR stations across the country 

and to that point, when I announce the final results, the second 

vote results, I’m going to raise my hand and ask you to applause 

to give us a rousing conclusion to our radio broadcast.   

 

But we are also on television throughout this season, on 

Bloomberg Television.  You can watch all of the fall debates on 

Bloomberg and read about them also with our other partner, 

Newsweek.  The results of this debate and the content of the 

debate will be summarized and analyzed in the next edition of 

Newsweek.  Books by tonight’s panelists and DVDs of past 

debates are on sale in the lobby but Jeff gets a free one from 

Doug, right?  [LAUGHTER]   

MAN  

That would be unfair.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Ah heh.

I should have read it, though.

JOHN DONVAN  

All right, is everybody settled down?  And I have the results in 

and our concluding numbers are these:  When you came in and 

voted beforehand, fifty-seven percent of you were for the motion, 

twenty percent of you were against and seventy-three percent 

were undecided.  After the debate, seventy-two percent are for, 

fourteen percent against, fourteen percent undecided.
