ROBERT ROSENKRANZ  

Well thank you very much, and welcome.  This is the final debate of 

the third season of the Intelligence Squared debates.  The very first 

debate that launched the very first season was the resolution, “We 

must tolerate a nuclear Iran.”  Well three and a half years, almost 

four years have gone by and Iran today has more influence in many 

neighboring countries than it had then.  Influences in Iraq, it has 

much more influence in Syria, it has much more influence in 

Lebanon.  It has supplied Hezbollah with more and better rockets 

aimed at Israel and it has made huge strides in uranium 

enrichment and the capability to build nuclear weapons.  These 

developments all challenge vital U.S. interests – the nuclear

program perhaps most of all.  And atomic weapons don’t have to be 

used to deter threats of regime change or to deter vigorous 

response to Iranian provocations like proxy attacks on Israel or, in 

a possible scenario – interference with the flow of oil through the 

Strait of Hormuz.  But we have to recognize that these 

developments are rational ways for Iran to enhance their own sense 

of security and to project their power and influence in their 

neighborhood.  So tonight’s debate is not really about whether we 

should communicate with a hostile Iran, but what we should say.  

How can we plausibly induce Iran to change course?  What costs 

can we threaten or impose?  What inducements can we offer?  And 

finally, what role should diplomacy have in this process?  We have 

a really outstanding panel tonight to shed light on these questions 

and it’s my pleasure at this point to turn the evening back to John 

Donvan.  [APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you.  And given that this is the conclusion of the third series 

of Intelligence Squared U.S. and that Robert Rosenkranz started 

this thing and it’s gone into its third year now, I just want to invite 

one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz.  [APPLAUSE]  

Welcome to another Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I’m John 

Donvan of ABC News Nightline and I will be moderating the four 

debaters you see sharing the stage here with me at the Caspary 

Auditorium of the Rockefeller University in New York.   Two teams, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 3. 

 

 

 

two against two for, two tables will be debating this motion:  

Diplomacy with Iran is Going Nowhere.  Now, I want to make clear 

that this is not a panel discussion or a seminar.  This really is a 

contest.  It is a debate.  It is a competition of ideas and logic and 

wit and possibly humor and charisma.  We’ll see how it goes.  But 

most of all it’s a contest of persuasion because these debaters are 

here to change your minds.  By the time the debate ends you will 

have voted twice – once before the debate begins and once again at 

the end, telling us whether you side with the motion or against the 

motion.  And we would like to register the preliminary debate right 

now, if you go to your key pads.  Once again, our motion is:  

Diplomacy with Iran is Going Nowhere.  Press number one if you 

agree with the motion, number two if you disagree and number 

three if you are undecided.   

 

And again at the end of the evening we’ll have you vote again and 

the team that has changed most minds from this initial position will 

be declared our winner.  [PAUSE]  All right, we’re locking in the vote 

and we’re moving forward.  And I just want to point out to our radio 

audience, because they cannot see the hall there, that there’s a 

little bit of a buzz about the fact that one of our guests is the former 

Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney, who is about four 

rows up.  [APPLAUSE]  And it occurs to me, sir, by saying four rows 

up I may have ruined the undisclosed location rule.  [LAUGHTER]

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 4. 

 

 

 

I apologize but I assume that we’re past that.  So to round one, 

opening statements, our motion is:  Diplomacy with Iran is Going 

Nowhere.  Our first speaker, arguing for the motion, Liz Cheney, is 

a lawyer and under the George W. Bush Administration, she was 

Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern 

Affairs.   Earlier in her career she served at the U.S. Agency for 

International Development.  She was in Poland, among other 

places, and curiously, Liz, in a debate that is about diplomacy, you 

have done quite a bit of diplomacy in your time.   

LIZ CHENEY 

Well, don’t hold it against me.  [LAUGHTER]  Thank you.  

[APPLAUSE]  Thank you very much.  It’s great to be here tonight.  

Dan and I are here with the task of convincing you why diplomacy 

with Iran is going nowhere.  And I think it’s important as we begin 

thinking about this issue to stop for a moment and ask yourselves, 

What is our current diplomacy with Iran?  What’s the current state 

of affairs?  The current state of affairs is that the Obama 

Administration has privately and publicly offered direct, 

unconditional talks to the Iranian regime.  The Iranian regime has 

failed to respond.  So as of now, there is no diplomacy with Iran.  

There are no talks.   

 

Even if there were talks tonight, Dan and I want to describe for you 

why it is that those talks, in fact, are going nowhere, and it’s for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 5. 

 

 

 

three reasons.  There are really three elements that should be 

present in any set of diplomacy to have any chance for that 

diplomacy to succeed in preventing the Iranians from obtaining a 

nuclear weapon.  First, the current set of diplomacy of diplomatic 

outrage by the Obama Administration includes no threat, no 

credible threat of military force should the diplomacy fail.   

Secondly, there is no time line in place that would prevent the talks 

from dragging on and on and prevent the Iranians from using the 

talks as an excuse to continue to develop their nuclear program.  

And third, none of the very crippling economic sanctions that might 

actually convince the Iranians that the cost of attaining a weapon is 

too high are in place.   

 

Now, let me just be clear.  Dan and I are not arguing that force is 

necessary.  We’re not arguing that military force is unavoidable and 

we’re not arguing that diplomacy itself is doomed to fail.  We’re 

simply arguing that the current course we’re on is, in fact, a course 

to nowhere.  Now, as you think tonight about your vote with respect 

to this resolution, one of the really important things to consider, 

which the Obama Administration has not been considering, is the 

history of American efforts to reach out to the Iranians.   And I 

wanted to just run through for you tonight a few of the high points 

of that history, because any realistic effort to use diplomacy 

effectively has gotta take that history into account.  In 1979 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 6. 

 

 

 

National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski met in Algiers with 

the Iranian Foreign Minister, Prime Minister and Defense Minister.   

 

And according to a note taker who was present in the meeting, 

Brzezinski told the Iranians, quote:  We will accept your revolution, 

we will recognize your country, we’ll recognize your government, 

we’ll sell you all the weapons that we contracted to sell the Shah.  

Three days later the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized.  Two 

weeks later the Iranian officials Brzezinski met with had lost their 

jobs.  In 1980 Warren Christopher negotiated the Algiers Accord 

with the Iranian regime.   The Iranians agreed to take no further 

hostile actions against the United States.  Three months later they 

seized the American, seized new American hostages in Lebanon.  

One year later they attacked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and three 

years later they killed two hundred and forty-one Marines in their 

barracks in Beirut.  Throughout the 1990s the Europeans 

threatened to impose sanctions if the Iranians didn’t alter their 

behavior.  The Iranians did not alter their behavior and the 

Europeans did not impose sanctions.   

 

In 1996 Iran was responsible for bombing Khobar Towers in Saudi 

Arabia, killing nineteen American soldiers.  Despite this attack in 

the late 1990s Washington decided it was time to try again, to 

extend yet another hand to the Iranians to build a new relationship.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 7. 

 

 

 

We lifted parts of our sanctions program allowing food and 

humanitarian efforts, or humanitarian supplies, into Iran.  And the 

President and the Secretary of State gave speeches essentially 

apologizing to the Iranians for past American behavior.  In 

response, the Iranian Supreme Leader said these apologies were, 

quote:  Too little too late and did no one any good since the 

Americans continue to commit such crimes.  Now, you can read a 

much fuller account of this part of the diplomatic history in Ken 

Pollack’s terrific book, which I really do commend to you, called The 

Persian Puzzle.  You’re welcome.   

 

But to, [LAUGHTER]  to be fair, though, it’s not just Ken who has 

been involved in failed attempts to reach out to the Iranians.  Nick 

and I have also have our fair share of that, as well, when we both 

worked in the Bush State Department.  2004, the European Union 

III completed the Paris Agreement with the Iranians in which they 

promised to suspend enrichment activities.  In August of 2005 

Ahmadinejad was elected.   They announced they were continuing 

their enrichment activities and the Russians prevented us from 

attaining any real sanctions against the Iranians at the United 

Nations.  In 2006 we took the step of offering for the first time in 

thirty years direct negotiations if the Iranians would give up their 

enrichment program and our European allies committed to 

imposing tough sanctions if they didn’t.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 8. 

 

 

 

 

The Iranians didn’t give up the enrichment program and, of course, 

our allies wouldn’t allow us to impose tough sanctions.  In 2007 the 

National Intelligence Estimate, parts of which were declassified, 

showed there is one thing, actually, that the Iranians did respond 

to.  Although the Iranians did continue to enrich uranium they did 

halt other parts of their nuclear weapons program in the immediate 

aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.  In 2008, despite the fact 

that the Iranians had failed to meet any condition we had set for 

direct talks and despite the fact that they were funneling weapons 

and terrorists into Iraq to kill Americans, we sent our 

Undersecretary of State, Bill Burns, to meet with the Europeans 

and Iranian representatives.  Once again the Iranians learned that 

no red line is really a red line.  To sum up this history let me quote 

from the man who was actually the note-taker at that first meeting 

in Algiers in 1979.  He’s our current Secretary of Defense, Bob 

Gates.  Describing this meeting recently, Secretary Gates said, 

quote:  Every administration since then has reached out to the 

Iranians in one way or another and all have failed.   

 

Some have gotten into deep trouble associated with their failures, 

but the reality is the Iranian leadership has been consistently 

unyielding over a very long period of time in response to repeated 

overtures from the United States.   In closing let me just say that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 9. 

 

 

 

the history of our attempts to reach out to Iran offer us lessons 

about the three things that might actually work in terms of 

inducing Iranian effort, in terms of stopping Iranian efforts to attain 

a nuclear weapon.  We’ve gotta have a credible threat of the use of 

force if diplomacy fails.  There have to be crippling economic 

sanctions that impose a significant cost on Iranian attempts to 

attain a weapon and we’ve gotta have a timeline so that the 

diplomacy doesn’t drag on forever.  None of those things 

characterize our current nuke diplomacy with the Iranians.  And 

therefore, diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere.  Thank you.  

[APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN   

Perfectly timed.  Because we give each of the speakers seven 

minutes and that was six minutes and forty-eight seconds.  Huh, 

huh.  [LAUGHTER]  Very, very well done.  Arguing against the 

motion, our other diplomat in this debate, Nicholas Burns, who is 

now a professor in the practice of diplomacy at the Harvard 

Kennedy School.  But for twenty-seven years he served five 

presidents, ultimately as our nation’s top ranking career diplomat.  

And Nick, I understand that under the second Bush Administration 

you were the State Department’s point man for Iran but you were 

not allowed to speak to any Iranian officials.   How long did that 

persist?  Three years.  Well, here you’re free to talk as much as you 

want, as long as you’re within seven minutes.  Ladies and 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

gentlemen, Nick Burns.  [APPLAUSE]   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I’m 

delighted to be here.  And thanks to Intelligence Squared for 

bringing all of you here for this important debate.  I can think of no 

issue facing our country that’s more important to our future, more 

important to Israel, more important to our Arab partners than the 

issue of Iran.  And I thank Liz for her remarks.  It’s good to be on 

the same dais with Liz and Dan.  They’re former colleagues of mine 

from the United States government, and Ken as well.  We hope to 

convince you tonight, Ken and I, that actually, it’s very difficult to 

say that diplomacy is going nowhere with Iran when we haven’t 

started diplomacy with Iran.   

 

I have something to say about this and some familiarity about this.  

I was for three years the point person on Iran on the negotiations 

perspective for Iran for the United States government for President 

Bush and I never met an Iranian government official during those 

three years.   With the exception of a couple of meeting in Baghdad 

between – and these were public meetings – between our 

Ambassador and the Iranian Ambassador to Iraq there were no 

sustained negotiations between the United States of American and 

the Iranian government.   So we attempt, we want to convince you 

that we’ve gotta give diplomacy a chance.  We can’t give up on 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 11. 

 

 

 

diplomacy before we’ve started diplomacy.  I think that’s the first 

thing I’d like to say to you.   Second, it is important to remember a 

little bit of the history that Liz reviewed.  We’ve had three decades of 

a non-relationship with Iran.  It’s the most unusual diplomatic or 

non-diplomatic relationship we have in the world.  Since the 

Iranian Revolution there have been times when American officials 

have talked to Iranian officials but there have been no sustained 

negotiations on the nuclear issue and even on any other issue for 

many, many years.   

 

That’s not a situation that we should feel proud of.  It’s certainly 

not a situation that advances our national interests.  We have no 

diplomatic relations with the government of Iran.  We have no 

business community, American business community, in Iran and 

haven’t for thirty years.  There is no major presence of American 

journalists.  So we’re in the extraordinary position of looking at a 

government that arguably poses the greatest challenges to the 

United States in the Middle East and yet we know precious little 

about that government.  So that’s what this evening’s debate is 

really all about:  how to be tough minded --  and I certainly agree 

with Liz and Dan on that --  about the Iranian government, but also 

there’s a twin challenge, a second challenge:  how to engage that 

government sufficiently so that we have a much better 

understanding of what its bottom line is, of whether or not a deal is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 12. 

 

 

 

possible, about whether or not diplomacy can be successful in this 

case.   

 

President Obama intends to begin negotiations this summer, 

probably after the June 12th Iranian elections.  My successor, 

Undersecretary of State Bill Burns, did meet with the Iranians once 

last year for a couple of hours.  But the Obama Administration is 

about to test the proposition that perhaps we should have more 

extended discussions with the Iranians --  not because we’re acting 

of naivete, not because we’re weak, not because diplomacy is 

feckless, but because it’s our self-interest to gather information 

along with the Russians, Chinese and Europeans and see if there’s 

some way to maneuver the Iranians, pressure the Iranians away 

from a nuclear weapons future.   

 

I certainly agree that there’s a lot to worry about with the Iranians.  

They are seeking a nuclear weapons capability that would change 

the balance of power in the Middle East against us.  They’re 

funding and directing most of the major Middle East terrorist 

groups that are a problem for us, for Israel and for our Arab 

partners.  And because of their proximity to Iraq and Afghanistan 

they are fundamentally involved in both countries and in a way 

sometimes that’s very detrimental to the United States.  But the 

problem I have, and I think the problem all of us have in looking at 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 13. 

 

 

 

this question is, have the policies of the Clinton Administration and 

even the administration in which I served, the Bush Administration 

--  have they succeeded?  Policies of isolating the Iranians, policies 

of refusing to meet with Iranian government officials, calling for 

regime change against Iran --  I would submit that those policies 

have not worked.   

 

And the test of any American policy is not whether we feel good 

about them or feel good about giving speeches.  It’s are they 

effective?  And therefore I think that President Obama is right to, to 

embark on a new path.  What is that?  It’s a combination of 

engagement with Iran and also pushing back against Iran to protect 

Israel, to protect United States’ interests.  And what would that 

negotiation look like?  The United States, Britain, France, Germany, 

Russia and China would be on one side of the table with Iran on 

the other.  We would be arguing that Iran should cease and desist 

in its nuclear weapons ambitions, cease and desist in its support 

for terrorism.  The only way to make that point effectively at this 

point is to stand opposite them and to engage them.  Now, I agree 

with Liz.  We’ve gotta be very tough minded.  We’ve, I think 

President Obama would be well advised to put a time limit on these 

negotiations so that the Iranians don’t run out the clock.   

 

He’d be well advised to keep the military option on the table 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 14. 

 

 

 

because that is language that the Iranians would understand, and 

certainly well advised to say to the Iranians, If negotiations don’t 

work we are prepared to put Draconian economic sanctions on you.  

Because we’re not gonna give up on this fight to make the Middle 

East safe from an increase in Iranian power.  Why try diplomacy?  

First, it’s the only way we will ever know if a peaceful outcome is 

possible.  It’s the only way we’ll ever know if we can avoid a war in 

the Middle East.   Second, we already have two wars underway in 

the greater Middle East – in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Unless it is 

absolutely necessary do we Americans want to embark on a third 

war?  Third, negotiations will actually isolate the Iranians.  It’ll put 

the United States on the offensive for the first time in a long, long 

time and it will actually increase international leverage against the 

Iranian government.   

 

And fourth, we are no worse off if we try diplomacy because if 

negotiations fail we will be in a much stronger position than I was 

as the person negotiating with Russia and China and the 

Europeans, to say to them, especially to Russia and China, We did 

what you asked, we tried diplomacy.  Now you need to back us in 

very tough sanctions against the Iranian government.  You need to 

put the weight of your governments behind the United States.  We’ll 

be in a much better place to say that, to be convincing about that if 

we try diplomacy first.  I don’t see how we can say that negotiations 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 15. 

 

 

 

and diplomacy are going nowhere if we haven’t made a concerted 

attempt to try diplomacy first, backed up by a very tough minded 

American policy.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN   

Thank you, Nick Burns, arguing against the motion.  Arguing now 

for the motion that diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere, Dan 

Senor -- a man who I know put his own security where his mouth 

was.  I know this because in the early days of the U.S. invasion of 

Iraq I kept running into Dan Senor on my trips there.   He located 

himself there full time to work as spokesman for the Coalition 

Provisional Government.  He is now considerably better groomed 

than he was during those, that Baghdad summer.  He is on the 

National Council, he’s on the Council of Foreign Relations and has 

co-founded the Foreign Policy Initiative and is here to argue that 

diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere.  Dan Senor.    

DAN SENOR  

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you, John.  And it’s good to be on 

this panel with Liz and Ken and Nick, who probably all agree on 

more things than we disagree.  But certainly on this issue there is 

disagreement.  It’s also always good to be considering debating a 

potential conflict – heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf --  while 

in the heart of the Upper East Side.  Liz and I are really advantaged 

in this and it’s live on BBC, no less.  I just want to pick up on 

something Nick said, that it is hard to say that diplomacy with Iran 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 16. 

 

 

 

is going nowhere if it hasn’t really begun.  I would say he’s right, 

the second part of that – that it really hasn’t begun.  But it’s not for 

lack of trying.  I think it’s important to evaluate not only the history 

that Liz went through, in terms of the decades of efforts to negotiate 

and deal with Iran, but also actually look at just the last few 

months and the signals that this administration has sent to Iran, 

even before this administration took power.  In 2007 and 2008, 

while this country was consumed with this fresh face on the scene 

– Senator Barack Obama – so was the world.  There was deep, 

intense election night coverage in the United States but also on Al 

Jazeera and Al Arabiya and the Arab satellite channels and the 

different news broadcasts throughout the Middle East.    

 

They actually covered primary, they have their own primary election 

night specials in the region – the best political team in Abu Dhabi 

coverage, or whatever you want to call it.  And they were consumed 

with this.  They were consumed with it for a number of reasons, not 

the least of which is so much of Barack Obama’s message was a 

clear rejection of U.S. foreign policy under George Bush.  In fact, in 

the Democratic primary, one of his sharpest criticisms against 

Senator Hillary Clinton at the time was that she was basically a 

closet hawk, that she would represent somewhat of a continuation 

of Bush foreign policy.  And the issue he specifically drew contrast 

with her on that was Iran, because she had supported some tough 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 17. 

 

 

 

sanctions that related to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.   

 

And, and Obama called this a continuation of Bush policy on Iran.  

There is going to be change.  And the American people 

overwhelmingly voted for this new face, this change, this rejection, 

if you will, which was a centerpiece of now President Obama’s 

campaign – overwhelming voted and sent a message to the world 

that there would be a new policy. Barack Obama’s inaugural 

address with President Bush sitting a few steps away, he issued 

some pretty sharp, very public criticisms while the world was 

watching of the former administration’s foreign policy over the 

previous eight years.   

 

He then in his first hundred days made good on his commitment on 

Iraq, which is basically to move along some sort of timeline for 

withdrawal, which was a big issue for the Iranian government.  He 

has in recent weeks been very assertive about his plans for 

pursuing aggressively a two-state solution on the Israeli-Palestinian 

conflict – another important issue to the Iranian leadership.  He 

traveled to Europe and gave a series of speeches in which, again, he 

almost apologized for U.S. foreign policy over the previous eight 

years and made clear that things were going to change.  And then 

finally and most importantly, he was issued an unconditional 

invitation to sit down with the Iranian government, in defiance, I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 18. 

 

 

 

might add, of three Security Council resolutions that call on the 

Iranian government to halt its nuclear program.   

 

President Obama is putting himself out there.  He is really exposing 

himself by making such a clear and bold initiative for diplomacy.  

The only problem is, despite all this, against all this backdrop, the 

Iranian government still has not returned the call.   So it is true 

that diplomacy has not begun.  But it is not for a lack of trying.  As 

Dennis Ross, who is currently advising President Obama on Iran 

policy today, has said in a report that was issued by the Bipartisan 

Policy Center late last year, If we have to chase the Iranians to the 

table then any hope of diplomacy is off the table.  We can, there can 

only be a truly viable diplomatic track if we can get to the table 

quickly, both sides agree that there is a real diplomatic process.  At 

the moment we are chasing the Iranians to the table.  We are off to 

an unwinnable start.  So I would just simply say that it is true that 

diplomacy has not begun but it is not for a lack of trying, which 

raises questions about where it is actually going.  And finally, I 

would just pose the following question to Ken and to Nick:  If you 

argue that it hasn’t gotten off the ground but it will get off the 

ground, the question is, What is your timeline?   

 

I commend a report to all of you that came out today issued by the 

Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Iran.  Chairman John Kerry 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 19. 

 

 

 

of the Senate Committee hired an investigative journalist and hired 

a number of other journalists and former Intel officials who actually 

traveled around the region to really get their own independent 

assessment of how far Iran is from having a nuclear weapon.   And 

the report was issued this afternoon.  You can get it on the Foreign 

Relations Committee website.  It’s very clear.  The time for inaction 

is narrowing.  So if we say diplomacy hasn’t begun and we gotta let 

the beginning, the path to the commencement take place, and then 

we’ll consider how long the actual diplomatic process will take, is a 

tough sell, given the timeline that many are projecting, including as 

of today the most recent, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   

 

Finally I would say the question that needs to be considered is, 

What is the nature of the regime we are dealing with in Iran?  If we 

believe that there is a possibility of diplomacy being successful, if 

that is our objective to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear 

weapon on this path, what is the nature of the regime?  Is it a—one 

possibility is that it is a radical theocracy – in which case I’m not 

convinced they can be persuaded against a nuclear weapon.  And if 

they are driven by some sense of martyrdom and some sense of 

inevitable outcome that is worth sacrificing their country I’m not 

convinced that they can be persuaded that they should not have a 

nuclear bomb.  Perhaps they’re rational and a nuclear bomb would 

bring them national power, it would deter U.S. threats in the future, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 20. 

 

 

 

it would cement potentially their hegemony throughout the region.  

And if they’re rational and that’s what this is about, I believe there 

are no inducements we can offer them.  There are none that, no 

carrots that would be better than all that they would gain from 

having a nuclear bomb.  So if we are going to pursue some sort of 

diplomatic path it must have a real timeline that is narrow and it 

must be backed up by a very credible threat of military force and a 

very credible threat of crippling sanctions and a real clearly defined 

publicly available trigger point for those actions to take place.  

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN   

Thank you, Dan Senor.  And finally, arguing against the motion 

that diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere, Ken Pollack, whose 

point of agreement with Dan Senor back in 2002 was his book, 

Threatening Storm, which argued for the toppling of the Saddam 

Hussein regime.  Since then he has written about Iran, arguing for 

negotiations and his most recent book, A Path Out of the Desert:  A 

Grand Strategy for America in the Middle East, makes the same 

point – and I must say, ‘cause I’ve read it, is a terrific read.  Ladies 

and gentlemen, Ken Pollack.  [APPLAUSE]   

KENNETH POLLACK 

Thank you all.  It’s wonderful to be here.  Thank you, John, and Liz 

also, for the plugs for my books.  I can’t appreciate that enough.  I 

promise to get you a check later on.  [LAUGHTER]  And it is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 21. 

 

 

 

wonderful to be up here with my friends, with Dan, with Liz, with 

Nick, debating a very important topic.  I thought I’d start where 

Nick left off.  I thought I’d start by talking a little bit about the 

potential for a peaceful resolution.  And we need to recognize that 

there is the prospect.  We don’t know – and I say this as someone 

who has studied Iran for over two decades – at the CIA, at the 

Department of Defense, at the National Security Council and the 

think tank world.    

 

We don’t really know what the Iranians want.  We don’t really know 

what they’d be willing to give.  And in direct answer to Dan’s 

question of what might it take...Why have they not taken the choice 

already?  Well, we haven’t put the choice to them directly.  The 

choice that we need to put to them is a very simple one.  You get to 

have a good, thriving economy which is ultimately what the people 

of Iran want or you get a nuclear weapon.  But you don’t get both.  

The critical thing that you need to keep in mind – and I don’t think 

that Liz and Dan necessarily disagree with that --  but the critical 

thing that you need to get, keep in mind is how we get to that 

choice, how we force the Iranians to recognize that they get to have 

one or the other, not both.  They don’t get to have their cake and 

eat it, too.  I agree that this regime in Iran is not yet ready to sit 

down and compromise with us.  I think they’ve made a tactical 

decision to talk to us.  They have not made the strategic decision to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 22. 

 

 

 

compromise with us.  And so the question becomes, How do we get 

them to that point?   

 

Well, as Liz very nicely described, we tried, when I was first in the 

Clinton White House, at the NSC, working on Iran.  It was 1995-96, 

the period when the Clinton Administration, of which I was a part 

and working on Iran, imposed comprehensive unilateral sanctions 

against Iran.  And these sanctions hurt.  Do not believe for a 

second that those sanctions were meaningless.  They hurt Iran and 

they hurt Iran to this day.  But they haven’t hurt Iran enough to 

force them to make that choice, to make it the way that we want 

them to.  Later on we tried in 1998-99, my second time in the White 

House, to bring the rest of the world on board because we 

recognized that the only way to put that kind of pressure on the 

Iranians was to get the support of the world, to get them on board 

with the same kind of sanctions which could inflict the kind of pain 

on the Iranians that would force them to make that choice, the 

choice that they’re trying to avoid.   

 

And what we found was that the rest of the world wasn’t ready.  

And Nick and Liz tried the same thing during the Bush 

Administration and they found the same thing.  And what we 

consistently heard over and over and over again was, You have not 

made a good faith effort with the Iranians.  You’ve not put a deal on 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 23. 

 

 

 

the table that they might accept, you have not given them a chance 

to say yes.  Now we can debate about whether that’s true or not, 

but the simple fact is, that’s what the rest of the world believes.   

And until we convince them otherwise, they’re not gonna join us in 

imposing harsher sanctions on Iran, the kind of sanctions that 

might force the Iranians to come to that decision.  Now the second 

thing that I wanna do, is to talk a little bit about what happens if 

we stop the diplomacy.    

 

Because we do need to think about that, it’s the elephant in the 

living room.  If we’re not talking to Iran we’ve gotta be doing 

something else.  And as I said, unilateral sanctions, no matter how 

clever both the Clinton and Bush administrations were in imposing 

unilateral sanctions, those don’t seem to be enough.   And so if 

those aren’t gonna be enough, and we’re not gonna try to 

diplomacy, that is the one way that we might be able to get 

international support for the kind of harsh sanctions on Iran that 

might change their mind, well, alternatives start to look a lot worse.   

And I say that as someone who is very realistic about the chances 

of diplomacy with Iran.  I could add, Nick could as well, a half-

dozen other problems to the ones that Liz and Dan have already 

mentioned.  Okay, we’ve been through it, we know how hard it is to 

deal with the Iranians.    

 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 24. 

 

 

 

But the simple fact is, that diplomacy is much better than any of 

the other options, all the options stink.  But some of ‘em stink a lot 

worse than others.  Option one, we could do nothing.  We could sit 

back and try to contain the Iranians, and deter them once they’ve 

got nuclear weapons.   I don’t know about the rest of you, but that’s 

a social-science experiment I’d prefer not to run.  [LAUGHTER]  

Okay?  We don’t know what the Iranians will do when they have a 

nuclear weapon, I tend to doubt they’d actually use it, but I’m not 

certain, and I wouldn’t want to find out that I was wrong.   And 

even if I am right about it, we’re going to face an aggressive Iran, 

one that is going to be much more willing to support its terrorist 

allies, all across the Middle East.  The last thing that the Middle 

East needs is more trouble, more instability, more Iranian-assisted 

troublemaking in the region, and that’s exactly what we get, if we 

allow them to have the nuclear weapon.    

 

Another alternative is regime change.  We go in there and we 

decided we’re gonna get rid of the governments.  And the way that 

people typically think about regime change in Iran is, we’re gonna 

spark a popular revolution.  And people say that because the truth 

is that as best we can tell most Iranians don’t really like their 

government, and they’d like to see it changed.  The problem with 

this is, that revolutions are very unpredictable, and they’re very 

rare.  And we don’t really know how to get one started in Iran.  And 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 25. 

 

 

 

beyond that, we have what’s called, what I call the Groucho Marx 

problem.   That every—remember Groucho once famously said that, 

he wouldn’t wanna be a member of any club that would have him 

as a member?  Well, every Iranian oppositionist who accepts money 

from the United States of America, is totally not someone we should 

be giving money to.  [LAUGHTER]    

 

‘Cause they probably work for the Iranian intelligence services, and 

they probably don’t have any support among the Iranian people, 

because since 1953, when we overthrew Mossadegh, we have been 

the third rail of Iranian politics.   And the last option that’s out 

there, and I don’t think anyone on the panel is arguing for this but 

let’s remember it, is war.  Okay.  We can try airstrikes against the 

Iranian nuclear program.  But don’t think that this is gonna be a 

quick surgical strike.  Okay, the Iranian program is big, it is 

dispersed, it is hardened.  It is going to require hundreds if not 

thousands of sorties, to take down that program.  And most of the 

intelligence people I’ve spoken to including the Israelis, believe that 

even a wildly successful strike would probably only set the program 

back by one or two, maybe if we got really lucky, three or four 

years.   And the Iranians will retaliate.  And they will rebuild.  And 

we will have to strike again.  Okay.  This will not be a surgical 

operation, it will as Nick said, be an open-ended war.  Another 

open-ended war in the Middle East.

These are all paths that we may have to confront at some point in 

time, but I’d suggest to you that we shouldn’t do so, until we have 

made sure that there is no diplomatic solution.  We’re not there yet.   

And let’s just remember, the very wise words of Franklin Roosevelt, 

a man who was determined to wage World War II because he knew 

it was the right thing to do.  But who famously once said, that jaw-

jaw is better than war-war.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Ken Pollack.  This is an Intelligence Squared debate, 

I’m John Donvan, your moderator, we have two teams of two 

members each, debating this motion, “Diplomacy with Iran is going 

nowhere.”  And we’re gonna now reveal the…debate— the vote 

numbers, we ready with those?  Do I have them in my hand—okay.   

As you recall when you came in you were asked to vote on the 

motion, “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere”…you pushed 1 if 

you were for, 2 if you were against and 3 otherwise.  It’s a three-

way split.  34 percent are for the motion—  [LAUGHTER]  33 

percent against, and 33 percent undecided.   And, reminding you 

that the way we predict—the way we call victory is the team that 

moves the most minds during the course of an evening and so it’s 

really a horserace at this point.  On to round two, and in round 

two, the debaters address one another, they take questions from 

you the audience and also questions from me.   I wanna begin with 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 27. 

 

 

 

this, it seems as though we have a very basic disagreement on the 

facts when we hear Liz Cheney talk about repeated overtures, and 

Nick Burns arguing against the motion, saying that there has been 

no diplomacy, there is no diplomacy with Iran.   [And I wanna get 

to, which is it, has there been a lot of diplomacy, have there been 

many efforts or has there been… Nick, you more or less said 

nothing.  Respond to Liz’s claim that there have been repeated 

overtures.   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

Well I think I said that, you know, since 1979-80, there’ve been lots 

of individual meetings, I think between Americans and Iranians, I 

think every administration has done that.   

JOHN DONVAN 

But why is that not diplomacy—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

There have been no—  That’s not diplomacy.  That’s not what we 

mean by diplomacy.  There have been no sustained discussions on 

the nuclear issue, which is the most important issue.  Take…my 

example.  I served in the Clinton administration, and I served in the 

Bush administration.   In the Bush administration I had the 

responsibility for trying to put those negotiations together.  And we 

were not able to do that, we didn’t meet with anybody, we didn’t 

have extended discussions with the Iranians, we never got in the 

room with them, in a meaningful way.   That’s what diplomacy is.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 28. 

 

 

 

It’s actually trying to figure out what the other side is up to, what 

their bottom line is, seeing if it’s right for us, and smart for us to 

make a deal.  And I just pose the following question based on that.   

If you’re not for diplomacy now, and if you wanna give up on 

diplomacy which is the position of Liz and Dan, then what are you 

for.  You can’t say you’re not for war.  Because you’ll then leave 

President Obama with one option—to go to war, you’ll have no 

credibility to go to sanctions, as Ken said.   If we leave the 

diplomatic field right now, the Europeans, the Russians and 

Chinese will not support us on sanctions.  You’re leaving President 

Obama with one choice.  Go to war, third war…   

JOHN DONVAN 

Liz Cheney—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

—for the United States of America in the Middle East.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Liz Cheney.   

LIZ CHENEY 

Well I think first of all, Nick is mischaracterizing Dan’s and my view 

on this, Dan and I are not arguing that we should abandon 

diplomacy or that we should not undertake diplomacy.  Dan and I 

are simply arguing that the current diplomacy is going nowhere, 

and it’s going nowhere because it’s flawed diplomacy.   Now, 

discussing this issue with Nick, you know, I feel a little bit like Alice 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 29. 

 

 

 

in Wonderland here, because Nick and I sat in many of the same 

meetings over the course of a number of years, and, saying that we 

didn’t have diplomacy because we didn’t have sustained 

discussions completely ignores the fact that it was the Iranians who 

made that choice in many, many instances.    

 

And I went through in the beginning of the talk the extent to which 

the United States government has over 30 years attempted again 

and again and again, including our National Security Advisor sitting 

with the Iranian Prime Minister and saying, we will sell you 

weapons, we will recognize your country, we’ll recognize your 

revolution.   And the Iranians walk away from the table time and 

time again.  Now I think this gets to a very fundamental point that 

Dan made which is, what is Iran, what is the nature of that regime.  

And part of the problem with the current diplomacy, the reason 

why I believe—one of the reasons I believe it’s going nowhere is 

because there’s a fundamental misunderstanding, about the nature 

of the regime.    

 

You know, President Obama makes—gives a Norouz message to the 

Iranian people but also to the regime and he talks about things like 

common hopes, and common dreams.  I don’t believe that we have 

any common hopes or dreams with the supreme leader in Iran.   I 

don’t, I think the supreme leader in Iran believes in exporting 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 30. 

 

 

 

terrorism, he believes in exporting his Islamic revolution, and I 

think that, you know, at the end of the day, you’ve gotta ask 

yourself, you know, as Kissinger was asked, is Iran a country, or 

are they a cause, if Iran is a cause, if they are a hegemonic, 

revolutionary, terrorist, extremist power, and they’re attempting to 

gain a nuclear weapon, then we are being dangerously naïve and 

irresponsible to pretend that we have now history here of trying to 

talk to them—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Let me bring in the other side?  [APPLAUSE]  Nick Burns.    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

It’s important to note that this famous meeting that Liz has now 

cited twice took place 30 years ago.  Not exactly in modern times.  

I’d also say this in defense of President Obama.  I’m impressed by 

him, I’m someone who’s not a Republican, I’m not a Democrat.   I’m 

not a political person.  I think he’s actually outpointing the 

Iranians.  He’s put them on a defensive.  That Norouz message was 

not to the supreme leader.  It was to the Iranian people.  And I 

think it’s—  [APPLAUSE]  It makes a lot of sense.   It makes a lot of 

sense to stretch out a hand, to the Iranian people, over this chasm 

of three decades—what has President Obama done?  The Norouz 

message.  He invited Iran to a UN conference on Afghanistan.   He 

said that the United States for the first time would join these 

negotiations unconditionally which I happen to think is the right 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 31. 

 

 

 

thing to do right now.  Because our prior policy didn’t work.  With 

the Iranians.   And so therefore, it’s hard to argue that diplomacy’s 

going nowhere when President Obama’s taken baby steps to put us 

maybe into the first phase of diplomacy.  I would submit that we’ve 

all gotta give him at least six months to try diplomacy—    

JOHN DONVAN  

Dan—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

—before we denounce it—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Dan Senor.    

DAN SENOR 

Can I just ask a question—or go—go ahead.   

LIZ CHENEY 

I just wanna make one quick point which is that our opponents 

need to decide what their position is.  Their position is either, 

diplomacy hasn’t started, which is what they both argued when 

they made their opening presentation, it hasn’t started, it’s gonna 

start this summer, give it some time.  Or their position is, well, 

diplomacy has sort of started with some baby steps.  Or their 

position has gotta be, you know, look, it’s started and the Iranians 

have responded well, you know, they gotta choose one of those.   

But I would say that, that at the end of the day what we’ve seen 

actually is the administration has attempted to reach out a hand, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 32. 

 

 

 

the Iranians have not responded and there’s a report this 

afternoon, uh, out of the Jerusalem Post that the Iranians are 

actually basing missiles now along the Straits of Hormuz.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Ken Pollack, your—your opponent’s calling for clarify on your 

position.   

KENNETH POLLACK 

Yeah, look, I think that to say, have they started yet or are they just 

taking baby steps, it’s a difference without real substance there.  I 

think the point that we’re trying to get at here though is that, we 

don’t really know what the Iranian position is.   And more 

importantly still, the diplomacy is about more than just Iran.  In 

fact the most important object of our diplomacy, are as Nick was 

suggesting, as I suggested, our European allies, our East Asian 

allies, the Russians, the Chinese, everyone else who is probably 

going to have to come onboard, before the Iranians realize that 

they’ve gotta make a serious decision—   

JOHN DONVAN  

But is—isn’t that diplomacy about Iran as opposed to diplomacy—   

KENNETH POLLACK 

Correct, that is—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—with Iran which is—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 33. 

 

 

 

KENNETH POLLACK 

That’s exactly—well, but both of them are interlocking.  Because 

the rest of the world is not interested in us only having diplomacy 

with them, without also trying to engage the Iranians.  That’s what 

they want.  That’s the carrot for them.  And in return, we’re trying 

to get them to sign up for the stick.   

[PAUSE, INAUDIBLE VOICES]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Liz, I—if you, can you come a little closer to the mic—    

LIZ CHENEY 

Yeah, I just wanna—you know…actually it’s not fair to say the rest 

of the world wants us to talk to Iran.  I think that you’ve actually 

got a situation now, you saw it during the election, where you had 

the British for example act, you know, demonstrate extreme 

nervousness with the notion that suddenly the United States was 

offering direct, unconditional talks, which is basically leaving our 

European allies aside.  Our European allies have been with us in 

the European Union III, we’ve been working on a multilateral 

course for diplomacy, direct talks cuts them out of the picture.  We 

haven’t even talked about our Arab allies, and the notion that the 

Arab nations today want us to talk to Iran, you know, is a fallacy.  

What we’re hearing from government after government after 

government, is that they are very nervous, they believe the United 

States is about to make deals with Iran, and so they are now 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 34. 

 

 

 

thinking do we need to make our own deals…?   You know, their 

concern is so great that we’ve sent our Secretary of Defense out to 

calm ‘em down, so the idea that the rest of the world wants us to 

talk to Iran, fundamentally mischaracterizes the danger of this new 

openness and this unconditional—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

Liz, I don’t—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Ken Pollack—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

—[UNCLEAR] disagreement here, and the—   

LIZ CHENEY 

[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  

JOHN DONVAN 

All right, I’m—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

The fundamental disagreement I think—  

JOHN DONVAN 

—I’m, just to clarify, Nick Burns—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

—that I certainly have with Liz is that I spent most of my time 

between 2005 and 2008 shuttling to Paris and London and 

Moscow, and Beijing on this question.  Those partners of ours want 

us to have talks with Iran.  They have accepted I think, I know 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 35. 

 

 

 

they’ve accepted, that now we should do it unconditionally.   We—

when we conditioned in 2006, our entry into negotiations on Iran 

suspending its enrichment program, it gave the Iranians an excuse 

not to come to the table.  Obama has taken away the excuse, which 

is one of the reasons why I’m impressed by his sophisticated 

diplomacy.   And I can tell you for certain, that the European allies 

agree with this, and that they are ready to negotiate with us on that 

basis.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Dan Senor.    

DAN SENOR 

[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  [APPLAUSE]  Nick, if the Americans have 

taken away the excuse, how long before the Iranians reciprocate, I 

mean, how long, you said six months, are you giving six months for 

them to agree to come to the table, or are you giving them six 

months, once they agree to come to the table, that then they have 

six months to figure out whether or not we can get a deal.    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

You know, Ken and I are not arguing that diplomacy is a panacea.  

We’re not naïve.  We know that diplomacy might not work, but if 

you try diplomacy, and give it a shot, then it does strengthen us for 

what’s ahead, what’s ahead of us.  Two major options to deal with 

Iran.   One is to go back to very tough sanctions of the type that we 

haven’t tried before, because we haven’t had the credibility to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 36. 

 

 

 

convince the rest of the world to do it.  And finally the use of force, 

and I’ve said, we should leave the use of force, the threat of it on 

the table, we should threaten sanctions, but you’ve gotta go 

through this diplomatic process first, to get to either of them.  If you 

don’t do that you have no credibility—   

JOHN DONVAN  

What’s on the table is that the Iranians don’t want negotiations,  

Dan Senor said chasing Iranians to the negotiating table.  Ken 

Pollack, do you think Iran, anybody in Iran wants negotiations—   

KENNETH POLLACK 

I think the problem is that the Iranians do want negotiations, it’s 

not clear that they actually want a deal.  That’s the problem, and 

that’s exactly what Dan is getting at, and he’s right to.  But, you 

know, the point that—  Look, we’re not the ones writing out the 

policy for the administration, if we were we’d be glad to engage this 

question of exactly when.  For the purposes of this debate, for the 

abstract expression of it, I think that the key point is again, what 

will it take to get the allies signed up for the tough sanctions.  If it’s 

six months of making a good-faith effort, fine.   If they say nine, 

fine.  Now, we can’t let it go forever, and for me the big question 

mark is can we get them signed up to harsh sanctions in advance, 

based on when the Iranians pass certain milestones.  That oughta 

be the key question.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 37. 

 

 

 

LIZ CHENEY 

[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC] make a point there because that is an 

important point, and actually we did that.  We had them as Nick 

well knows signed up in advance for tough negotiations in 2006 

when we offered tough sanctions.  When we offered direct 

negotiations, the deal was, that the allies would agree ahead of time 

that they would support tough sanctions on the Iranians if the 

Iranians did not agree to suspend enrichment.   The Iranians did 

not agree to suspend enrichment, we got Security Council 

resolutions which the Russians in particular, as Nick knows 

because he spent hours and hours dealing with the Russians, 

managed to take every single tooth out of.    

 

Now we’ve, since the Obama administration has been in office, had 

the Russian foreign minister in Washington, and he’s announced 

that in fact he doesn’t believe it’s time for tougher sanctions against 

the Iranians.   But, I think it’s very important for people in the 

audience, first of all to look at the wording of the resolution, the 

question is not all of the questions that Nick and Ken are trying to 

get you to focus on, it’s not should we go to war, it’s not, should we 

do diplomacy or not diplomacy, the question is, is our current 

policy going anywhere.   That’s the question, and I find it really 

fundamentally irresponsible, for Nick and Ken to act like, let’s just 

give diplomacy a chance ‘cause we haven’t done it before.

JOHN DONVAN  

Nick Burns.    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

Right.  Liz and I are, I’m not gonna engage in attacks, Liz and I are 

friends and we’ve been colleagues—  [LAUGHTER]   

JOHN DONVAN 

I— 

NICHOLAS BURNS 

It’s not true—   

JOHN DONVAN  

—honestly, I don’t think that was an—a personal attack—  

NICHOLAS BURNS 

Oh—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—that was—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

I’m—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—that was right to the core of the argument—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

—it’s not true that we also—it’s not true that we live in alternate 

universes.  But it may seem that way.  Now what happened in 2006 

when the United States government made the most ambitious offer 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 39. 

 

 

 

we’d ever made…and I really commend President Bush and Vice 

President Cheney and Secretary Rice for order—authorizing that.   

We made a very good offer and the Iranians turned it down, that’s 

the Iranians’ fault, they walked away at that time.  But what hadn’t 

happened—  [BRIEF APPLAUSE]  What hadn’t happened is that we 

did not have explicit promises from the Russians and Chinese, 

much less the Germans, French and British, as to what type of 

sanctions would follow.  And so what Ken and I are arguing is that, 

it would I think behoove itself to President Obama, to make a very 

explicit deal with Moscow and Beijing, before the United States sits 

down at the negotiating table, the Russians and Chinese will 

specify the type of sanctions that would ensue, should negotiation 

fail.   That would be a stronger position that we had in the Bush 

administration.   

LIZ CHENEY 

[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  this policy was actually sold internally, 

because people were told that we had commitments that there 

would be sanctions if the Iranians in fact did not suspend 

enrichment, now maybe you’re—now maybe you’re, it’s semantics 

about specific sanctions.   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]   

LIZ CHENEY 

But the idea was, the—I’m telling you what I know.  [LAUGHTER]  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 40. 

 

 

 

What I know is that we had a commitment from those allies that we 

would go to sanctions, that they would support tough sanctions, if 

in fact the Iranians refused to suspend.  The Iranians refused to 

suspend, and we got no tough sanctions.    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

The tough—the word “tough” is not accurate.  I negotiated that 

deal, ahead of time—   

LIZ CHENEY 

You negotiated—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

—and I negotiated—  

LIZ CHENEY 

—for weak sanctions.    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

No I didn’t.  [LAUGHTER]  I didn’t.  I mean let’s be fair about this, 

Liz.  Let’s be fair about it.  I served in the Democratic 

administration and Republican administration.  The policy of both 

President Clinton and President Bush has not worked…and we 

oughta have the courage to see it—   

LIZ CHENEY  

I totally agree with you—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

—and the courage to admit it—  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 41. 

 

 

 

LIZ CHENEY 

I agree with you.    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

And so what President Obama is trying to do, is to create a new 

type of diplomacy, it is very tough-minded.  It allows us to fall back 

on military force if we have to, but it does give diplomacy a chance 

for the first time.  We did not have commitments, for the type of 

specific sanctions that would go into play, and you haven’t seen 

that in 2006 and ‘7 and ‘8, these were very weak UN Security 

Council resolutions, admittedly.   And now we’ve gotta have a 

different way of going forward, with diplomacy.  So if Liz and Dan 

say, diplomacy’s failing, President Obama’s failing, then I think 

what they’re really doing is leaving him with one option and that is 

war and they can’t deny that—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Dan Senor, the—Nick Burns just made the point, why not give it a 

chance, it’s a new initiative, and he says in a new style, why not 

give it a chance.    

DAN SENOR 

 ‘Cause it takes two parties to participate in a diplomatic process 

and right now there’s only one party participating in it.  So we can 

call and call and call all we want, [APPLAUSE]  but they’re not 

participating, and I know we’re asking everyone here to vote on this 

motion, as Liz alluded to earlier, the Arab world which is closest to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 42. 

 

 

 

this, is already voting.  How they think diplomacy is going, how 

they think the current strategy is going, I just wanna read you an 

editorial from the Jordan Times.  It says “Arab capitols have all the 

right to be worried about a new adventurous US policy in this part 

of the world that may again not succeed as planned.   Washington 

surely cannot dramatically shift its policy vis-à-vis the countries in 

the Gulf.  The new administration lo—risks losing its barely-

regained credibility in the region, if it does not consult its friends 

about its new standpoints in the area, new friends should not come 

at the expense of old ones.”   This was not written at the height of 

the unilateralism of the Bush administration, this was published in 

the Jordan Times today.  The Arab world is deeply concerned, that 

the message the administration is sending is it’s gonna cut some 

sort of grand bargain potentially with the admini—with Iran at best, 

and at worst, leave an open-ended process which is this, we’re 

calling and calling and begging them to come to the table and 

they’re never responding, and oh by the way the clock runs, and a 

nuclear bomb appears at the end of the day.  So, debating, you 

know, giving diplomacy a chance, not giving it a chance, we’re 

perfectly prepared to give it a chance but just listen to those closest 

to it in the region.  They don’t believe that there’s any reciprocity on 

the other side.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Ken Pollack.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 43. 

 

 

 

KENNETH POLLACK 

I could—first, let’s, you know, you’ve accused us of 

mischaracterizing, let’s not mischaracterize what the Arabs are 

saying either.  They are concerned about the negotiations, they are 

not saying don’t offer to talk to the Iranians, they are not saying 

don’t talk to the Iranians.   What they’re saying is when you talk to 

the Iranians, do this and this and you better tell us everything 

you’re doing and you’d better not do the following things.  Second, 

as Nick pointed out, the answer to the issue is not, that we only 

have two people at the table and one won’t come.   There is a third 

party in the room, as we keep trying to point out, that’s the entire 

international community.  And the question I would put back to 

you and to Liz, Dan, is basically this.  You are saying you want 

tough sanctions.  How do you plan to get those tough sanctions 

without going through diplomacy.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, I’d like to…  [APPLAUSE]  I’d like to bring you into the 

conversation now and I’d like to do it in the form…I would find a 

way to say what you wanna say and answer, it’s a politician’s trick 

and…  [LAUGHTER]  I’ll call on you, please try to keep your 

question to 30 seconds or thereabouts, really a question, you can 

make an opening comment, certainly to state your premise but we 

don’t want you arguing as well because we have four very good 

debaters here.   Hold the microphone this close to you, and where’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 44. 

 

 

 

the center microphone—  Gentleman right on the center aisle here, 

please.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Hi, I—I’ve heard Nick’s argument, and I think without getting in a 

more just round, in a circle, I’ve, from my perspective don’t see 

where the Iranians would give a lotta credibility to these threats of 

sanctions or war or anything else, so I would like to hear the panel 

kinda debate and address, what do you think the…make, make the 

arguments for what the Iranians have to gain, by giving up these 

nuclear weapons, and, what they have to lose.  Ken started to touch 

on it.  But it hasn’t really been explored.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Ken, can you—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

And I would get into that to decide whether diplomacy can go 

anywhere.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Ken, put yourself in the position of the Iranian government in a 

negotiation with the US, what do they want.    

KENNETH POLLACK 

Sure.  Look, I think the truth is that the Iranians don’t want to be 

in these negotiations because they’re very happy with the status 

quo, that’s the regime.  Okay, and that’s exactly a point that Dan 

and Liz have made, they’re absolutely right.   We’re dealing with an 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 45. 

 

 

 

Iran that is at least bifurcated, what the people want and what the 

regime want are often two different things.  And that’s ultimately 

the goal of the diplomatic process.  Is to put the regime on the 

horns of a dilemma.    

 

To say to them you can have what you want or what your people 

want, but not both.  And you’re going to have to choose.  And what 

we’ve seen with this regime is, while they are autocratic, while they 

control absolute power in Iran, they are very sensitive to public 

opinion.   They don’t like to be put in the position where it is clear 

that what they are doing is the exact opposite of what their people 

want.  And what their people want is a thriving economy.  Their 

economy is in desperate straits at the moment, it is going down the 

toilet.   Comprehensive international sanctions could push it over 

the edge, and the regime is extremely fearful of that.  On the other 

hand, what we can offer them if they do the right thing and that’s 

what we threaten them with if they do the right thing, if they do the 

right thing what we can offer them is the economic support that 

they so desperately need.  The lifting of not just the international 

sanctions but of our own unilateral sanctions, the provision of 

trade credits, investment guarantees, and everything else.  We say 

to the Iranians, you have two paths.   You can choose the path of 

darkness, you keep your nuclear program and your support for 

terrorism and everything else, and we will cripple your economy.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 46. 

 

 

 

And that is something that your people will not abide.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Dan Senor—   

KENNETH POLLACK 

Or, you can do the other way, and we will make your economy 

thrive—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Dan Senor—  

DAN SENOR 

I would just argue that, it is true, the economy is in desperate 

shape, 25, 30 percent inflation right now, 25, 30 percent 

unemployment, oil trading today about 60 dollars a barrel.  They 

are in a much weaker, you know, less than half than what it was a 

year ago, they are in a much weaker economic situation.   But if 

it—what Ken is stating, that the Iranian government, which is 

complicated and opaque and difficult for all the reasons Nick said 

for us to truly understand, but if you believe that the Iranian 

government, is effectively going to make a rational decision and 

they can be won over with inducements which is what he’s saying,  

what package of inducements could we ever offer them, ever, that 

would be better than the situation they would get from having a 

nuclear bomb.  I mean think about this, a nuclear bomb would be 

able to guarantee that the US would never threaten them again, we 

would—   If Iran tomorrow decided that they wanted to go into 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 47. 

 

 

 

Bahrain which they consider one of the original Iranian-Persian 

provinces, if they wanted to go, slowly take over Saudi oil fields, 

which would certainly help their economic situation, we would have 

virtually no leverage, we would pose no threat to them and as 

they’d try to further establish their own hegemony as I said earlier, 

in the region, having a nuclear bomb would allow them to cement 

that.  What inducements do we have to offer them, that would be 

better than all that a nuclear bomb would give them.   

JOHN DONVAN  

I thought that was a rhetorical question, but Ken, you—  

[APPLAUSE]    

KENNETH POLLACK 

Come on…Dan, do you really believe that even after the Iranians 

have nuclear weapons we’re gonna let them take over the Saudi oil 

fields?  We did a pretty good job of keeping the Russians out of 

Germany, I think we can keep the Iranians on the other side of the 

Persian Gulf.  [APPLAUSE]    

DAN SENOR 

I think trying to—  This is a classic fallback position, trying to 

compare the Iranian regime to other governments, and other 

situations—   

KENNETH POLLACK 

But, they’re much weaker, that’s my point.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 48. 

 

 

 

DAN SENOR 

Yeah, but potentially—and there’s also potentially an internal divide 

and fissures within the regime that’s divided between those who are 

motivated by national interests and those that are radical 

theocrats, as President Obama has described them,  that aren’t 

terribly rational, and trying to figure out and game them out and 

hope that we can win over and resolve those fissures in the short 

period of time before they actually have a nuclear bomb, to me, is a 

pretty big gamble.    

JOHN DONVAN  

And your partner, Liz Cheney?   

LIZ CHENEY  

Yeah, I mean I think it’s, you know, terrific to sort of sit here and 

say here is the ideal set of circumstances, we gotta have these 

tough sanctions and, Liz and Dan, how are you gonna get those 

tough sanctions, you know, without doing diplomacy.  And I would 

say the history of the relationship shows, we aren’t gonna get tough 

sanctions with diplomacy, the current diplomacy that we’ve got, at 

the end of the day, what Dan is—the argument Dan’s making is 

absolutely right that, the Ira—  There are not inducements at this 

point, there are not inducements that make the Iranians better off 

than having the bomb.  What does cause the Iranians to alter their 

behavior and what we have seen historically is if they believe that 

there is a credible threat of military force if they don’t alter their 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 49. 

 

 

 

behavior.  This is also true of our European allies.  And as you’re 

talking about this diplomacy I think we need to think about the 

motives of all of the people, all the partners involved here.  You 

know, the Europeans, as we’ve seen throughout, they like their 

commercial relationships with Iran, and they don’t like the notion 

that the United States is gonna use military force against Iran.   If 

they believe the threat of military force is on the table, that’s frankly 

the only thing I’ve seen that convinces them they better get serious 

about sanctions.  We have not seen them serious about sanctions, 

and I think the idea that we’re gonna call this current diplomacy 

strong or tough diplomacy, it simply doesn’t bear out if you look at 

the facts.   This is diplomacy with no teeth, this is, you know, an 

open hand, direct and unconditional.  And—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Question from the second row.  [APPLAUSE]  You can stand up 

and, if you’re a member of the press please identify yourself.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

 [INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  pardon me, I’m nervous with this 

distinguished panel and this audience.  I’ve one simple question for 

the Burns-Pollack team, with this basic background.  Hope springs 

eternal, but history tends to repeat itself.   And we’ve had 30 years 

of diplomacy with a capital or small “d.”  We’ve had, Burns admits 

that in the, I think he said, ’96 or ’97, we gave a real good deal, and 

Iran flipped us whatever you wanna insert after that.  My question 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 50. 

 

 

 

is this.  In the concept of we don’t know what Iran wants, I mean, 

we listen—  

JOHN DONVAN 

You know—go to your question—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

My question is, can either Burns or Pollack point to any single 

thing, over the past 30 years, including Obama’s welcome mat of 

the last few months, that gives us any hope that history won’t 

repeat itself, and that diplomacy has ever gone anywhere.    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you for your question.  

I just fundamentally disagree with Liz and Dan, that there’s been 

diplomacy, over the last 30 years, I am a professional diplomat, I 

now teach diplomacy, at a university.   It hasn’t been diplomacy.  

We have not had sustained engagement with the Iranians.  And the 

problem I have and what I find slightly irresponsible about the 

other side’s position, they wanna strangle this current diplomatic 

initiative of President Barack Obama, in its infancy.  It’s about 30 

days old.  President Obama rolled out most of what he thinks 

should happen about 30 days ago.  I think what you can expect, is 

that after the June 12th Presidential elections in Iran, you’re gonna 

see Iran accept negotiations, you’re gonna see Iran at the 

negotiating table.   My best judgment would be that first round of 

talks will likely fail.  I’m trying to strengthen us, in arguing for this 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 51. 

 

 

 

policy, for the sanctions that come, and trying to strengthen us to 

find a way to deny Iran a nuclear weapons capability.   If you start 

from the presumption that diplomacy is soft, and weak and un-

American, and there are some people who believe that, then I can’t 

help you.  Because that—that you’re just left with a military option.  

I think we’ve gotta stage this, we’ve gotta think 15 or 16 moves 

down the chess board.   I think that’s what President Obama is 

trying to do, give him a chance, and let’s show a little patience for 

diplomacy to play out.  [APPLAUSE]    

LIZ CHENEY  

Neither Dan nor I are trying to strangle these efforts, in fact we are 

very hopeful that these efforts will succeed, I think everybody on 

this panel wants diplomacy to succeed in stopping Iranians’ 

nuclear weapons program.   But I think that you have got to be 

realistic about what it will take to have that success.  And when I 

hear Nick talk about 15 or 16 moves down the table and the first 

round is gonna fail, people need to look at how the Iranians in the 

past have described these discussions with us.  In August of 2005, 

the chief Iranian nuclear negotiator gave an interview on Iranian 

television in which he explained in great detail and with great pride, 

that he was using the negotiations in order to gain the time that 

they needed to get the nuclear program up and running.   He 

admitted it, he was open about it.  The notion that, we’ve got 15 or 

16 moves and we’ve got all kinds of time, I mean, I’d like to hear 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 52. 

 

 

 

Nick explain how he can feel comfortable that we’ve got the time to 

undertake the kind of slow and cautious, toothless diplomacy, that 

we’re currently engaged in.  [APPLAUSE]    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

I just wanna correct the record in one—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Did—did he really say toothless at point—   

LIZ CHENEY 

No, I said—  

[OVERLAPPING VOICES]   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

I want to correct the record in one aspect, when Ahmadinejad was 

elected and sworn in in August of 2005 and when the Iranian 

negotiator made those remarks, he was not referring to negotiations 

with the United States, we were not in negotiations.   The British 

and French and Germans were.  The Russians and Chinese were in 

it.  The diplomacy has evolved, so to suggest somehow, that 

because of the European negotiations failed in 2005, the United 

States should therefore not enter negotiations, is just not 

historically right.  In the way that, in the way that Liz put it—    

LIZ CHENEY  

No.  What I’m suggest—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

And I think that anyone who—I’m just gonna finish my thought if I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 53. 

 

 

 

could.  I think that anybody—  [LAUGHTER]  I think that anybody 

who understands diplomacy and tries to learn from it understands 

that it doesn’t occur over a 30, or 40-day time period and here’s the 

weakness, in Liz and Dan’s argument.   They’re arguing against 

something that has just begun.  And we’ve gotta have the patience 

and determination to see this first phase concluded, or else, or else 

we leave ourselves with no appreciable option to resolve this 

peacefully if that’s possible.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Dan, very briefly—   

LIZ CHENEY 

We’re not—wait, I just need—   

JOHN DONVAN 

I wanna go to—back to the audience but Dan, very briefly respond 

to that.   

DAN SENOR 

I will give my time—   

JOHN DONVAN 

You will cede your time—   

DAN SENOR 

—to my partner here—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—to your partner.  [LAUGHTER]  That was a very wise move—   



Media Transcripts, Inc.

DAN SENOR 

I, you know…  [LAUGHTER]    

LIZ CHENEY  

To say diplomacy has not begun ignores the 30 years of history.  

And the point that I was making about the Iranian nuclear 

negotiator was, the Iranians used negotiations to stall, they used 

negotiations to buy time.  So, Nick, are you saying you don’t believe 

that they’ll use negotiations to buy time if we’re at the table?    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

No, I assumed you listened respectfully when I was speaking as I 

did when you were.  I said—  [LAUGHTER]  I said, we should be 

tough-minded.  We should impose a time limit on the discussions.  

We should work out the sanctions regime with the Russians and 

Chinese before we sit down with the Iranians, and we should leave 

force on the table.  That’s tough-minded diplomacy, it’s certainly 

not toothless—    

LIZ CHENEY  

That’s not the current—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Question from the cen—   

LIZ CHENEY 

—that’s not the current diplomacy—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Question from the center, please.

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Thank you very much for an incredibly interesting panel and very 

illuminating comments…I think you’re offering very compelling 

arguments for both sides and I’m actually undecided at this point.  

To help me decide, it would be really great to know what both sides 

of the panel think in terms of, who exactly are the key allies we 

wanna sign up for the tough sanctions against Iran.   And what 

exactly are the tough sanctions, because, I have—I’m just 

wondering if both sides agree on what exactly both of those are.  

Thanks.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Nick.    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

That’s an excellent question and I think the tough allies that we 

need are not the Europeans.  The Europeans have actually cut 

their trade with Iran by two thirds since 2005, they’re moving in the 

right direction.   What has happened to us.  The Chinese have 

fundamentally watered down and violated the UN sanctions, they’re 

the number-one trade partner with Iran.  The Russians sell arms to 

Iran.  The Arabs, who profess to be very concerned about the rise of 

Iran, trade with Iran every day.  Specifically Saudi Arabia and the 

United Arab Emirates, the Japanese and the South Koreans trade.  

So what President Obama has to do, and what we tried very hard to 

do in our time in office, was to get all those countries to agree, that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 56. 

 

 

 

if the United States tries diplomacy it’s not gonna be feckless and 

toothless, that they will join us, they will commit to us.  We did not 

have that agreement, in 2006, specifically, we should try to get it 

now.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Question from the far side?   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I have two questions, my first question is, isn’t it a little bit—  

JOHN DONVAN 

I’d just like you to actually pick your favorite question.   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

Okay, my favorite question—  [LAUGHTER]  They go hand in hand 

but it’s okay.  It’s directed toward Miss Cheney.  Isn’t it a little bit 

convenient to place a historical context—historically contextualize 

your argument just to 1979, being that the United States helped to 

overthrow Iran and Iran’s first democratically elected government in 

1953?  [APPLAUSE]  That’s not something that happened 200 years 

ago, it’s something that happened in my grandfather and my 

mother’s lifetime so it’s pretty, I would imagine for people living in 

Iran it’s still a pretty salient point.   

LIZ CHENEY  

Well, I think the reason that you start in 1979 is because it’s the 

same government, it’s the government that took over after the 

revolution in 1979, and the people that we’re dealing with today are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 57. 

 

 

 

the heirs of the people that we were dealing with in 1979.   Now, 

there has been in many instances and we talked about it, you 

know, sort of this elusive attempt to find reformers, and I think a 

lot of what Ken did for example, during the Clinton administration 

was, attempt to reach out to those reformers.  You know, people 

talk about who’s up and who’s down, but at the end of the day I 

think what you’ve got is clearly a situation where, the government 

we’re dealing with today, in terms of its ideology, its objectives, its 

desires and its approach to the rest of the world and its approach to 

us, are in fact, you know,  they—they’re the Islamic government of 

Iran, they’re the inheritors of those that we were dealing with in ’79, 

which is why, I began in ’79, I mean you could go back thousands 

of years presumably as well.

Okay, your partner would like to add to that—

No, I don’t mind, I just—   

DAN SENOR 

Yeah—  

JOHN DONVAN 

—wanna know, what the framework is—   

DAN SENOR 

Nick and Ken keep setting up this false choice.  Either diplomacy, 

or military action.  And what Liz and I are arguing, is we are all for 

diplomacy.  We are for diplomacy that actually results in a 

diplomatic process beginning.  The process has not begun.   We 

are—and we believe that that diplomatic process will only get going, 

if it is backed up by credible threat of military action, we are not 

arguing for military action.  But we are—we do believe that the 

Obama administration has to persuade our allies—   

JOHN DONVAN  

But I—I believe I’ve heard the other side say exactly the same 

thing—   

DAN SENOR 

But, —

Exactly, President Obama—  President Obama’s strategy does not 

involve that, so if Nick and Ken wanna come to our side and 

acknowledge that that is the problem.  President Obama has not 

made clear that military action is serious and credible—

I think— I was thrilled to hear Liz say that you guys are in favor, 

you want diplomacy to work.  The question I would have for you is, 

what is it about what we’re doing now that you think is inadequate, 

what more do you want to do.  ‘Cause my guess is not only would 

we sign up for it, my guess is the Obama administration would sign 

up for it too.

JOHN DONVAN  

Nick.  [LAUGHTER]  Nick, did you wanna follow up ‘cause I have 

another question or I can go to—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  I think that Dan has not given President 

Obama sufficient credit.   I heard him say during the campaign on 

multiple occasions, that he believed that we should leave the use of 

force on the table.  We haven’t seen the full articulation of the 

policy.  I have every reason to believe it’s gonna be very hard-

headed and very tough-minded, it’ll include all the things that all of 

us are talking about.   So to suggest that somehow this is feckless, 

toothless, soft, ineffective diplomacy, when it’s likely to include all 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 61. 

 

 

 

the elements that Liz and Dan have suggested, I think is a little bit 

premature.    

DAN SENOR 

[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  I don’t disagree, I hope President Obama 

comes forth with that, he hasn’t done so yet, my only point is if you 

are going to have a credible use—if you’re gonna have a credible 

threat of force, you have to articulate a timeline, a trigger point, and 

a credible threat of force.  President Obama has done all the things 

that you have, have hoped he would do, except that last piece, so I 

don’t know why anybody in the Iranian regime, or among our allies, 

would take that threat that you’re positing as serious when the 

President himself has not taken it—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Nick, last year during the campaign you wrote in support of the 

President’s offer to talk to adversaries.  You wrote a piece in 

Newsweek in which you said, “We should have enough self-

confidence to talk to your adversaries,” why is it a matter of self-

confidence.   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

There is this notion, in some parts of the political spectrum that we 

should not talk to governments with which we disagree.  I don’t 

think that is in our self-interest.  And I think we oughta have the 

self-confidence to understand that whoever represents the United 

States of America at the negotiating table is going to be tough-

minded.  Is going to try to achieve—   

JOHN DONVAN  

But you’re not hearing that argument from this other side of the 

table today, that’s not the—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

Not today.  But certainly I think one of the weaknesses of the 

Clinton approach and frankly, the approach in which I was 

involved, was that we didn’t have enough self-confidence to get to 

the table and trust ourselves, I think we weakened the diplomatic 

effort in 2006, by not attempting to talk to the Iranians, so I think 

the United States needs to engage those governments with, with 

which we disagree, Zimbabwe, —     

JOHN DONVAN 

Liz—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

And Iran, and Burma, governments like that.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Liz Cheney.   

LIZ CHENEY  

How much time do you give the Iranians.  How much time would 

you give the Iranians.  So we’ve gotta have this tough-minded 

diplomacy that you promise is coming, although I have to say the 

resolution says it’s going nowhere now, just to remind people in the 

audience.  But how much time.  I mean I understand what you’re

saying…  [LAUGHTER]    

KENNETH POLLACK 

I don’t see the word “now.”    

LIZ CHENEY  

It says “is going nowhere,” it’s present tense.  But at any rate, um…

KENNETH POLLACK 

—if you’re in favor of diplomacy too let us throw it back to you, how 

much time would you give it.   

LIZ CHENEY 

I would give it very little time.    

KENNETH POLLACK 

How much—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 64. 

 

 

 

NICHOLAS BURNS 

How much?   

LIZ CHENEY 

And I would say—  [LAUGHTER]  I would give it basically enough 

time that we could actually sort of test out, the extent to which 

we’re serious about using force, I mean I, you know, my own view is 

the window is closing pretty fast here.   I would say, you know, 

we’re very close to the point where, the Iranians themselves may in 

fact be near the point where any action that we take is insufficient 

to prevent them from actually gaining the value and the benefit of 

having at least the threat of a nuclear program—   

KENNETH POLLACK 

So is that six months or 12 or 18?

KENNETH POLLACK 

John, maybe the problem is just three months, maybe Liz believes 

six and we believe nine.   

LIZ CHENEY 

No, no, but it’s not just time, it—time as you heard me say at the 

beginning, time is key.  Now I— my patience has, as you know, 

been tested and I think probably is closer to the breaking point 

than Nick’s is.   And I think that’s a responsible position.  Because I 

think to take the position that you guys are taking which is, yes, it’s 

definitely going somewhere, although it hasn’t really started yet, 

and once it starts, it’s gonna take us a long time because, you 

know, to do this professionally—

What makes you think—   

JOHN DONVAN  

—in the second row has been very patient—   

LIZ CHENEY 

But what makes you think—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

If a game-changer is required, and it seems to be, would Russia 

support effective sanctions if we rethought our position on missiles 

in eastern Europe, and are there similar quid pro quos we could 

offer the Chinese for them to support effective sanctions, and would 

that not change the whole situation.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Ken?  [APPLAUSE]  That’s up your alley.   

KENNETH POLLACK 

Okay, you’ve asked a critical question, and this is part of what has 

to happen with the diplomacy.  We don’t know the answers to those 

questions.   But frankly, if we can make some of those deals, if we 

can do some old-fashioned horse trading, and different people may 

have different views on what deals we should cut, but if we can do 

that to get them onboard, maybe we will.   I think we probably 

ought to.  But we’re never going to know until we suss them out.  

Until we go to them and ask them what’s it gonna take.

LIZ CHENEY  

 [INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  situation, we have to remember this, we’re 

in a situation where we have offered, not just to talk.  You know, we 

offered to remove our objection to their WTO accession, we gave ‘em 

spare parts, we lifted pieces of our sanctions.   You know, we’ve 

offered a whole range of things to them.  And so for us to now be in 

a position where we’re going again to the Iranians and you know, to 

say to them, okay, well that didn’t work but how about if we do this 

for you, how about if we do this for you—   Each time, the Iranians 

refuse to take the steps that the international community has said 

they should take.  Nick and Ken seem to think we oughta go back 

to them again and say okay, well that wasn’t enough for you, what 

about this.  And I just think that’s a dangerous situation to be in 

when they are getting closer every day to having a nuclear weapon.  

[APPLAUSE]   

KENNETH POLLACK 

[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  the question.  The question was what do 

we do with the Russians and Chinese.  So we’re not talking about 

constantly going back to the Iranians.  What we’re talking is going 

for the first time to the Russians and the Chinese.   

LIZ CHENEY  

But it is a key point, it—you know, if in response to the Iranian 

intransigence, we decide that we are no longer gonna support the 

missile defense system, that in fact has helped to protect and will 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

help to protect some of our most important allies in the world 

against the eventuality, the potential of an Iranian nuclear weapon, 

that to me is a concession to the Iranians.  Now maybe, you know, 

it’s a concession we’re making to the Russians, [APPLAUSE] but it’s 

a concession to the Iranians.   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

I would not make those concessions right now either, I agree with 

Liz on this, I mean you’ve asked a great question.  The Russians 

and Chinese should be interested in stopping an Iranian nuclear-

weapons development program, because of their own interests.   I 

think what’s happened is they haven’t quite believed that we’re 

ready to give diplomacy a chance, therefore, if we can show a little 

faith in diplomacy for a little bit of time, I think we’re more likely to 

get them onboard than otherwise, but I wouldn’t trade the missile 

defense systems in eastern Europe with the Russians.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Question, sir?   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  to have been on the hot seat all night—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Can you start your question again—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Yes—  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 70. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN 

—because your mic was off—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

…so, I’ll keep you there.  One of the reasons I’m voting for…that the 

Iran—or the diplomacy is going nowhere, is something that our ally, 

Israel, had mentioned a few weeks back, and incidentally, I was at 

the first debate, and no one mentioned Israel at all and they’re the 

country that had the most to lose, and they’re our friends.   My 

question is when…Prime Minister Netanyahu said the other day in 

a very undiplomatic way, that if the United States doesn’t take care 

of this, we are.  Now I thought that was shocking.  That indicated, 

that they think, our diplomacy is sort of 1938 vintage with an 

umbrella, and a V sign, and it’s going nowhere.  [LAUGHTER]  So, if 

Mr. Netanhayu were here tonight, how would you assure him that 

he can maintain his confidence in the United States.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Nick Burns.  [APPLAUSE]    

NICHOLAS BURNS 

I’m glad you raised the issue, because we do have to talk about 

Israel here, I think one of the basic problems that the United States 

should have with Iran, is the threats that Ahmadinejad has made 

against the Israeli state and the existence of the Israeli people.  And 

it should be a vital national priority, and it is, for the United States 

to safeguard Israel, and protect it.  And that’s one of our key 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 71. 

 

 

 

strategic interests here, how do we best do that.  I fear that if we, if 

the Israelis launched airstrikes, or if we did, in the next couple of 

months, we wouldn’t have ever tested the proposition that maybe 

diplomacy and sanctions backed up by the use of force could work.   

And we get ourselves into a position where, we’d have the 

unintended consequences of war, we found out about that in Iraq.  

We’d have the ability of Iran to use Hezbollah and Hammas 

asymmetrically to attack Israel, to attack the moderate Palestinians 

and American interests.  And, I’m not aware of a convincing 

scenario where the use of force actually works.  And so, I would 

just say very respectfully to Prime Minister Netanyahu and he has a 

right to raise this issue--he should raise this issue--that the United 

States should make a commitment to Israel that we will safeguard 

its security.  They should allow President Obama, in my judgment, 

working very closely with Israel, to take the lead, for as long as we 

think that this diplomatic path can be successful.  There may come 

a time, when we wanna end diplomacy—  

JOHN DONVAN  

Dan—   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

—and go to a tougher option.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Dan Senor.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 72. 

 

 

 

DAN SENOR  

I would just, I’d put Prime Minister Netanyahu in the same category 

that I put all of the regional players, or at least many of them.   

Which they are deeply concerned about the mixed signals we’re 

getting from this administration.  Prime Minister Netanyahu’s 

saying what he’s saying because he is concerned that the 

administration is not backing up their diplomatic plan with a 

credible military threat to solve this problem if it doesn’t go 

anywhere.   That is the same thing that is going on throughout the 

Persian Gulf and the Arab world, and I take your point, your earlier 

point, Ken, that it’s very difficult to sort of read exactly what is 

going on in each one of these Arab societies, but, just the fact that 

Secretary Gates as Liz said earlier had to travel to Cairo and Riyadh 

to reassure them, don’t worry, we’re not gonna make this open-

ended,  and the fact that Dennis Ross has had to bounce around all 

these capitols to say, don’t misread what we’re try—you know, we’re 

trying to talk but it’s not gonna—  I mean, it gets to a point here 

where these people are voting, whether it’s Netanyahu or the king of 

Jordan or the king of Saudi Arabia, or, or the president of Egypt,  

there is deep concern in the region, and this is a profoundly violent 

and volatile neighborhood we’re talking about, where wars often 

start because of misunderstandings and miscommunications and 

mixed signals, and violent revolutions.   And we are dealing with a 

region right now, which I believe because of the current 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 73. 

 

 

 

administration’s lack of clarity about how they intend to back up 

this diplomatic process, if the Iranians actually ever enter into it, is 

potential for a very dangerous situation.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Sir, your question?   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

For clarification on what you mean.  The arguers against the 

motion, suggest that speaking with Russia and China would be part 

of diplomacy.  Whereas the arguers for the motion, I don’t think 

they would—they’re thinking of that kind of diplomacy.   As I 

understand the question, is whether we should negotiate or seek 

diplomacy, with Iran.  Or should just tell Iran to get lost, but, that 

still reserves the opportunity to talk with Russia and China and try 

to agree on a sanction.   So I’d like you each to define by what you 

mean by diplomacy, if you’re talking with China and Russia, who 

do you vote for in this debate.    

LIZ CHENEY  

I think we actually, probably all four agree that successful 

diplomacy cannot be bilateral.  Now, I don’t…I probably shouldn’t 

speak for my opponents here but successful diplomacy has got to 

include countries like Russia and China who actually have 

relationships with Iran that they could use, they’ve got leverage 

with Iran that they could use were they to choose to use it.   I think 

the difference between us, there are two differences between us, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 74. 

 

 

 

one is, I would say, you know, all right, let’s accept for the sake of 

argument that we can work with Russia and China to try to put 

tough sanctions in place against the Iranians.   There’s no evidence 

right now that there’s any intent on the part of either Russia or 

China, to put tough sanctions in place against the Iranians, that 

piece of this diplomacy is going nowhere.  And, I think the second 

difference is, you know, this question of how much hope do you 

hold out, after years and years and years, and, you know, Lavrov 

said to us,  you know, within the last six weeks, I don’t wanna have 

tougher sanctions on the Iranians, I mean we ran into this problem 

consistently.  At the end of the day, the only thing that will get the 

Russians and the Chinese and some of the other, some of the 

Europeans onboard with this is if they believe, if they don’t sign up 

for crippling sanctions the United States will use force.  And right 

now they don’t believe that.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Ken Pollack.   

KENNETH POLLACK 

You may have all noticed, we’re kind of competitive people, all of us, 

up here on this panel.  And we’re actually all friends too. Please 

don’t let the competitiveness drown that out.  And I wanna ask this 

question, not to score debating points, ‘cause I think that there is 

something really interesting going on here and I’ve just been kind of 

reflecting on it.  And this question really kind of brought it to the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 75. 

 

 

 

fore for me and it goes back to the question I raised before but— I 

wanna put it in a neutral fashion, I don’t want it to be a debating 

point.  But I do wanna ask this question, because you know, 

although I am the only Democrat on the panel, I am not speaking 

for the Obama administration.   And as Dan and Liz and I know, I 

am very glad to disagree with my own party, very publicly, 

whenever I think it’s necessary.  But the question I would like to 

ask is, what is it that you feel we’re not doing that we should be 

doing.  That would make—‘cause again, I think I’d probably sign up 

for it, and I just—I wanna hear it.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Dan, I can give you 20 seconds—   

DAN SENOR 

20 seconds—  

JOHN DONVAN 

—to answer that question—   

DAN SENOR 

—okay, I’ll be real quick, but I do wanna commend Ken for taking 

on his own party from time to time which he’s done on some pretty 

big issues so I—   

JOHN DONVAN  

That was a waste of four seconds—  

DAN SENOR 

Second—I know.  [LAUGHTER]  With my— with the balance of my 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 76. 

 

 

 

16, I will say, if you believe there is a discussion going on right now 

within the Iranian government between confrontationalists,   those 

who believe that we just need to plow—or the Iranians need to plow 

ahead and build their nuclear bomb and be quite confrontational, 

and those that are reformers that believe that, we can cut a deal, 

the Iranians can cut a deal with the west…we clearly wanna 

strengthen their hand.  And what better way to strengthen their 

hand than when they’re going into those discussions with the hard-

liners than to say, if we don’t act now, while employment is 25 to 30 

percent, while our economy’s falling apart, 70 percent of the 

population is under 30 years old, we could have a revolt here…   If 

the Americans move forward with truly crippling economic 

sanctions, or potentially military force, this regime will collapse and 

we will have a total mess on our hands.  That is the kind of leverage 

we wanna give the reformers in their internal debates with the 

hard-liners.   To say the Americans are lea—left this thing open-

ended, they’re having a discussion, we haven’t even returned their 

phone calls, this is great, the hard-liners aren’t gonna be terribly 

persuaded that they should, they should be responsive.    

JOHN DONVAN  

That concludes round two of our debate.  [APPLAUSE]  So we’re 

now in the final stretch and soon you in the audience will be 

choosing the winner, recall that, at the start of the debate we asked 

you whether you took sides with or against this motion, “Diplomacy 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

with Iran is going nowhere.”  Before the debate, it was an even split 

among the choices, 34 percent of you are for the motion, 33 percent 

are against, and 33 percent are undecided.   And soon we will have 

you vote one last time, but we are going to go now to our third and 

final round, each debater is given a brief amount of time, two 

minutes each, to make a closing statement…   And we will begin 

against the motion, Ambassador Nicholas Burns, former Under-

Secretary of State for Political Affairs.   

NICHOLAS BURNS 

Thank you, this has been a terrific debate, and I’ve enjoyed it very 

much, I like where Dan left off.  The way to get serious draconian 

sanctions, the only way in my experience and my judgment, is to 

continue this diplomatic process.  Is not to give up on it.   Is to 

bring the Russians and Chinese and Japanese and Arab countries 

in, the major trading partners, and to convince them to go along 

with us.  I think we face a real threat in Iran.  And we should be 

very tough-minded and very serious in facing it as Americans.   And 

we should not leave military force out of this.  We should leave that 

on the table.  We should have a threat of sanctions hanging over 

the Iranians’ heads.  But if we give up now, I’m afraid we’ll never 

know the answer to the question, was peace possible.  Did we have 

the patience and ingenuity and the courage to believe in ourselves, 

to believe in our ability to be successful at the—at the diplomatic 

table.

I think we should lead with diplomacy, with the military in reverse.  

I’m afraid that if we agree with Liz and Dan’s position, we’re really 

leading with the military, and we’re forsaking diplomacy.  President 

Obama has just begun his administration.   He’s just begun this 

diplomatic process, which is gonna be quite complex, it’s not gonna 

go on forever.  He needs to be given time, and we need to have the 

patience as citizens, to let diplomacy play itself out, not forever.  

But for—and I think everybody can agree on this.   For several 

months’ time, to test the proposition, that we might find peace, and 

not find war, I think frankly, that if we just tried war now, and gave 

up on diplomacy, and either emboldened the Israelis to strike, or 

struck ourselves, which is the logical conclusion of this position of 

our opponents,  I think it would be unconscionable of us, to go to 

war, to start a third war, without having given diplomacy a chance.  

That’s our position, I hope you’ll agree with it.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Nick Burns, and summarizing for the motion, 

“Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere,” Liz Cheney, former State 

Department official overseeing Mideast policy.    

LIZ CHENEY  

I would venture a guess that I’m somewhere to the right of many 

people in the audience tonight with one or two notable exceptions.  

[LAUGHTER]  But you don’t have to be as hawkish as I am on this

issue to realize that our current diplomatic track with Iran is in fact 

going nowhere.   You really only have to agree with the testimony 

that Nick gave before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last 

week.  In his testimony Nick very helpfully laid out steps that the 

Obama administration must take in order for diplomacy to go 

somewhere.   

 

He said, force must be on the table, President Obama needs to 

prevail upon Iran to freeze its nuclear research as the talks proceed 

so Iran does not steam ahead unimpeded.  President Obama 

should set a timetable, and finally Nick said, excuse me, that it’ll be 

crucial that the President agree on the automaticity of sanctions 

with the P-5 countries, especially Russia and China in advance of 

the talks.   Now I think we probably disagree on whether these 

steps alone are tough enough to convince the Iranians to give up 

their weapons.  But it is indisputable, that any of these steps are 

part of our current diplomacy.   Therefore, as we debate the issue 

tonight and as you cast you vote, I would say don’t be swayed by 

Nick’s division of, you know, vote for them and you’re voting for war 

and vote for us and you’re voting for peace.   What we’re arguing is 

that the current diplomacy is ineffective, is going nowhere, because, 

by Nick’s own definition, it does not include the steps that it needs 

to include to make diplomacy effective.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Liz Cheney.  And, summarizing against the motion, that 

“Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere,” Kenneth Pollack, Senior 

Fellow and Director of Research at the Saban Center for Middle 

East Policy at the Brookings Institution.   

KENNETH POLLACK 

I think there are two interesting things that are going on right here, 

in some ways we’re having two separate debates.  On the one hand, 

I’m really heartened by what we’ve all agreed to over the course of 

the last hour and a half.   I’m really struck by the fact that we all do 

believe that tough-minded diplomacy really is what this is all about.  

And, Liz, while it may be useful in trying to win this debate, I would 

suggest to you that I—you and I both know Nick pretty well, he’s 

not contradicting what he said before the Senate.  He still believes 

it, he hasn’t changed his mind over the weekend.  

 

And what we’re saying is effectively the same thing.  And so on the 

one hand, I think that the differences between us may be a matter 

of semantics, as I suggested it might be a matter of months.  And I 

think that’s actually really remarkable.   And it’s something worth 

taking away from this.  Is that we all are pretty close on this, and 

what we’re defining as what the right policy is is actually pretty 

close.  At another level though of course, the question as opposed I 

think raises a very different set of propositions in people’s minds.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 81. 

 

 

 

And that’s what Nick was trying to get at just a minute ago and I 

think that it is important to think about.  Because while I think 

that Liz and Dan have been very good about saying, look, we’re not 

talking about going to war, rushing to war or jumping right into 

these things, and we want to give diplomacy a chance, it’s just, 

doing some things differently and, we would come back and say, 

you know, look, the Obama people have just started, it’s not clear 

that these things aren’t part of what they’re doing, in fact there’s a 

lot of evidence to suggest it will be, I mean let’s remember, Hillary 

Clinton did talk about crippling sanctions against Iran, which was a 

very important point.   But at the end of the day there are a lot of 

other people out there who aren’t on this panel, who will say, look 

at that sentence and say, you’re right, time to go to war.  Or time to 

go to regime change, or something else.   And I think that’s what we 

have to be concerned with.  And those people don’t seem to be 

represented on this panel.  And as far as I’m concerned on the 

wider debate, the one that isn’t gonna be scored tonight in the US 

public, that’s the debate that we really have to focus on.   Because 

diplomacy is the right way to handle things, it is the right way to 

start.  If we don’t start there, we’re never gonna end up anywhere 

that we wanna be.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Ken Pollack.  [APPLAUSE]  And, finally summarizing for 

the motion, “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere,” Dan Senor, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 82. 

 

 

 

Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.   

DAN SENOR 

I would just close with a couple of quick points.  One is a quote 

that I’ll read that characterized the Iranian leadership in March of 

2007.  “President Achmadinejad is reckless, he’s irresponsible, and 

he’s inattentive to the daily needs of the Iranian people.”   That was 

not Liz Cheney, that was not Dan Senor, that was then-Senator 

Obama, in a speech in Chicago, on March 2nd of 2007.  That 

characterization is probably accurate, and is probably consistent 

with the history that Liz laid out in her opening.   

 

We don’t know exactly what will push the buttons of the Iranian 

people, none of us truly know what will push the buttons of the 

Iranian regime.  It is such an opaque society, I went through this 

with Iraq when there were many experts on all sides of the 

ideological spectrum who had very strong views about how the 

Shiites would respond to this and the Sunnis would respond to this 

and the Kurds would—  And, you know, some of them, all of them 

were— sometimes all of them were wrong and sometimes all of 

them were right, and as Nick said earlier, when you’re dealing with 

a society, for three decades we’ve had no communication, no 

interactions, it is very hard to know what’s going on inside.  So all 

we have to base this debate on is the history that we’re aware of, 

which Liz went through in her opening statement.  The actual 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” (5/13/09) Page 83. 

 

 

 

public statements of the leadership of the country which should 

count for something, and the rhetoric they have used with regard to 

Israel and the United States and the west is apocalyptic.   

 

And thirdly, their capabilities.  The capability that they are trying to 

develop, right now, in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, 

and in defiance of our effort to reach out to them.  That is a 

dangerous, toxic combination.  Their history of non-negotiation and 

stalling, combined with the public statements about what they 

would do, the genocidal rhetoric they, they articulate, that, they say 

they would use genocidal weapons for, and finally, the capability 

that they are trying to pursue.  So—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Dan Senor, I’m sorry, your time is up.   

DAN SENOR 

A dip—   

JOHN DONVAN 

I’ll give you 10 more seconds—   

DAN SENOR 

A diplomatic process is fine, as long as we are clear and we can 

make clear to the Iranians, where it ends, and how strongly we 

back up the alternative course in our negotiations.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN  

And that concludes round three of our debate, we will now have

amount in common, perhaps most pertinently that we both love to 

see a great fight started, and it makes for really good content for all 

of us.  There’s really no better time for us to be having this 

partnership, Intelligence Squared is expanding, it’s gonna be great 

to see it downtown.  And we are already launching the very fabric
