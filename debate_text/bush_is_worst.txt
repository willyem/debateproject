JOHN DONVAN 

…Okay, all of our preliminaries are out of the way, at this point, 

we’re going to begin the evening and it’s pleasure to introduce, to 

set the stage and set the theme, the chairman of Intelligence 

Squared, Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. 

[APPLAUSE]   

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Thank you very much and welcome.  Well, it’s my role in these 

evenings to frame the debate, and I think for most New Yorkers, 

we’re all very familiar with the liberal critique of George W. Bush.  

But even from a conservative perspective, the Bush presidency

could be seen as far worse than than Bill Clinton’s.   Clinton was 

for free trade, he spent a lot of political capital getting NAFTA 

through, versus the Bush administration with steel tariffs and 

ethanol subsidies.  Clinton had welfare reform.  This 

administration has had the first new entitlement of great scale in 

the last 40 years in prescription drugs for the elderly.  Clinton 

had a balanced budget.  This administration has had absolutely 

out of control public spending.  On the other hand, consider the 

following.  This administration accomplished something that 

nobody would’ve thought possible—they kept America safe after 

9-11.   And then think about a President like Nixon who was so 

reviled in his time, but whose rapprochement with China really 

set the stage, geopolitically for everything that transpired, the 

collapse of the Soviet Union, the emergence of the Chinese 

economy.   

 

Sometimes the historic perspective gives a very, very different 

view than what you see at the moment.  And finally consider 

Jimmy Carter.  He invented the term “stagflation,” we had 13 

percent inflation, no economic growth, 19 percent interest rates.    

He abandoned the Shah of Iran who was a staunch American 

ally, enabled the ayatollahs to take over in Iran.  His ineptitude 

during the hostage crisis emboldened Russia to invade 

Afghanistan.  He was a truly awful President.  So, there’s a lot to

be said on both sides here.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  And it’s my 

pleasure now to turn the evening over to John Donvan, and the 

outstanding panel that we’ve assembled tonight.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, and may I just invite one more round of applause, 

sustained applause for Mr. Rosenkranz for making all of this 

possible.  [APPLAUSE]  Welcome to the Symphony Space in New 

York City, we are here with a sold-out audience, for an 

Intelligence Squared US debate, in which the motion is, “George 

W. Bush is the worst American President of the last 50 years,” 

that is, “Bush 43 is the worst President of the last 50 years.”   I’m 

John Donvan, your host and moderator, and tonight we have, 

arguing for the motion, an esteemed panel, to my left, to your 

right, beginning with Jacob Weisberg, who is editor-in-chief of 

Slate and author of The Bush Tragedy.  [APPLAUSE]   Joining him 

on the same team, Simon Jenkins, a distinguished British 

newspaper editor and commentator.  [APPLAUSE]  Arguing 

against the motion, to your far right, Karl Rove, former deputy 

chief of staff to President Bush.  [APPLAUSE]   And his debating 

partner, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard and chief of 

staff for former Vice President Dan Quayle.  [APPLAUSE]  The 

Intelligence Squared and Intelligence Squared US debates are 

supported by the Rosenkranz Foundation.

Now, shortly you will be hearing from our four panelists, two for 

the motion, and two arguing against.  But this evening is a 

contest, a contest of wit and skill and logic and ideas and in that 

contest, you are the judges, we are going to poll you twice during 

the program, once now and once later.  We want to poll you to 

see where you stand on the motion.  After that the debate will be 

open for our opening statements, and then we’ll come to 

questions from you, the audience.  So, if you turn to those 

keypads that each of you had at your seat…as we explained 

before, it’ll only take a moment to vote, you press 1 if you agree 

with the motion that George W. Bush is the worst American 

President of the last 50 years, 2 if you do not agree, that Bush 43 

is the worst President of the last 50 years.  And number 3, if at 

this point you are undecided.   

[PAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Does anyone need more time?  [LAUGHTER]  Terrific.  We’ll come 

to those results shortly after we hear the opening statements 

from the panelists.  For this point let us say, let the debate begin, 

our motion is, George W. Bush is the worst President of the last 

50 years, Bush 43 is the worst President of the last 50 years.   

Arguing first for the motion is Jacob Weisberg, a chairman and 

editor-in-chief of the Slate Group.  He has just published a book,

a history of the Bush family in politics, its title, gives you a sense 

of where he is coming from on this debate, it is called The Bush 

Tragedy.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jacob Weisberg.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JACOB WEISBERG 

If you need more time I’m afraid I can’t help you.  I’d like to thank 

Bob Rosenkranz and Intelligence Squared.  I feel like I’ve spent 

most of the past year watching Presidential debates, it’s nice to 

finally be in one.  Please don’t change your minds, Bush was 

obviously the worst President of the past 50 years.   Yet the task 

Simon and I have tonight is extremely difficult.  We have to 

convince a small fraction of you, at least if you’re anything like 

the people who have given Bush the lowest approval rating of any 

post-war President, who still resist that conclusion.   And to be 

honest I’m not sure that people who still defend the Bush 

Presidency are entirely open to persuasion.  But I wanna try, by 

talking a little about how much Bush has done wrong and how 

little he’s done right.  Let me first just tell you a little bit about 

my own perspective on this, I am not a Bush hater.  I’m not 

someone who can be described as a partisan Democrat, the way 

Mr. Kristol and Mr. Rove are partisan Republicans.    

 

I’m a centrist liberal, I’m fairly hawkish on security issues, I’m in 

favor of limited government.  And let me just state up front, I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 6. 

 

 

 

think George W. Bush was a fine governor of Texas.  I think 

Ronald Reagan was a successful President, and I think George H. 

W. Bush, 41, understood foreign policy better than all but a few 

Presidents in the post-war era.   About two years ago, I started 

writing a book about the Bush Presidency.  And I was gonna 

spend a lot of time on Bush’s successes and accomplishments.  

And I’ll admit that I wanted to do that not just to be fair, but so I 

would look fair.  And, I looked for the successes and 

accomplishments, and I looked, and I looked, and I came back 

totally empty-handed.   There were a number of areas where I 

expected to stick up for Bush, but I really found it impossible.  

For example, I was sympathetic to his approach to education 

reform.  But even from a conservative perspective, Bush didn’t 

allow— provide enough resources to allow for any real mobility or 

choice in public schools.    

 

Instead of national standards which we needed he let the states 

write their own tests.  That’s what the conservative base wanted.  

They don’t believe the federal government should be involved in 

education at all, and in caving in to them Bush ensured that he’d 

make little meaningful progress on education and in fact, he has 

made very little meaningful progress.  I thought Bush was right 

about the need for immigration reform.  And then I watched him 

surrender to the xenophobes and nativists in his own party.  I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 7. 

 

 

 

thought Bush was right to spend a lot of money fighting AIDS in 

Africa.  And then I watched him save far fewer lives than he 

might have, because of religious extremists, again in his own 

party, who believe abstinence propaganda’s more effective than 

condoms.  I thought Bush was right about free trade, and then I 

watched his lack of leadership lead to the collapse of the most 

important item on the global trade agenda, the Doha 

development route.   

 

So, those are the partial successes.  I can’t hope to cover all 

Bush’s failures tonight.  What would be a top failure for a 

President doesn’t even really make his top five.  [LAUGHTER]   

So, never mind his incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina, it 

doesn’t make the cut.   Never mind his denial of climate change 

and eight lost years on global warming, that doesn’t make the cut 

either.  I’m just going to give you my top five.  Number one is the 

invasion of Iraq.   This was the most important decision of the 

Bush Presidency and he made it on the basis, as I think we all 

know, of the false premise that Saddam Hussein was threatening 

America with weapons of mass destruction, and consorting with 

al-Qaeda.   Now I’m not someone who believes that Bush 

deliberately falsified the evidence.  But I believe he was totally 

uninterested in the evidence.  This war would never have been 

fought, if Bush had been interested in the truth as opposed to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 8. 

 

 

 

finding a pretext for something he wanted to do.   

 

I think his second biggest failure is the mismanaged occupation 

of Iraq.  Bush refused for more than three years to change a 

failed military strategy.  And almost the whole time people like 

my friend Mr. Kristol here were desperately insisting, rightly in 

my view, that Bush needed to move to a counterinsurgency 

strategy.  Bush said, essentially, don’t bother me with the details.  

He delegated the strategy to Rumsfeld and he ignored the failure.   

I think the surge has helped tremendously in Iraq, the outrage is 

that Bush moved to it in 2007, not in 2003 or 2004.  His third 

biggest failure is undermining Constitutional rights, and 

American ideals.  Now I can’t go into detail here about all the 

ways he abused his authority, and disregarded the rights of both 

foreigners and American citizens.   

 

But he and Vice President Cheney opened the door to torture, 

which led directly to the horrors of Abu Ghraib.  He effectively 

suspended habeas corpus, holding suspects for years without 

charge or trail, and he took a perverse view of his office, claiming 

that virtually limitless executive authority was part of the 

inherent power of the Presidency.  His fourth failure was 

sabotaging American unity after September 11th.  The day after 

the attacks, the front page of La Monde in Paris said “We are all 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 9. 

 

 

 

Americans.”  The whole world was with us.  But Mr. Bush and 

Mr. Rove saw September 11th as a political opportunity for what 

Spiro Agnew called, “positive polarization.”   Now Simon is gonna 

speak to the harm, that this did to America’s image in the world.  

But I would just say, with a new administration coming into 

office, never in more than 200 years of our history has restoring 

America’s around the world been such an urgent project for a 

new President.   

 

Number five, my last, is Bush’s catastrophic economic 

mismanagement, which is so current we hardly even need to 

spell it out.  It remains to be seen whether we’re facing a 

depression, whether Bush will stand in for Herbert Hoover.   But 

I think it’s clear that we’re living through the direct result of an 

ideological refusal to sensibly regulate financial markets.  Bush 

says he’s sorry about all the lost jobs, if you saw his interview on 

ABC last night.   But, as he loses his, the interesting question is 

whether he ever understood [WARNING TONE], or understood 

now, his own contribution.  Now our opponents this evening, may 

try to argue that Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter was worse.   But 

neither of those Presidents failed as badly as Bush.  Carter had 

the Camp David agreement, and despite Watergate, Nixon left 

historic accomplishments including opening relations with China, 

and creating the Environmental Protection Agency.

Neither of them rivals Bush for sheer, all-pervading 

incompetence.  [LAUGHTER]  But if our opponents tonight—  

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  I’m closing here, if our opponents 

tonight wish to argue that Bush was only the second worst 

President of the last 50 years, that’s not much of a defense.  This 

national nightmare, I would suggest, has been the deepest and 

longest of all.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Jacob Weisberg.  And actually perfect timing.  Bill 

Kristol is the editor of the influential Washington-based political 

magazine The Weekly Standard.  Just over a year ago he wrote a 

piece predicting that President Bush’s Presidency would be 

remembered ultimately by history as a successful one.   We 

bumped into each other on the street last week, and he said, “I’m 

still prepared to argue that, but can I leave out the US economy.”  

[LAUGHTER]  Bill Kristol, ladies and gentlemen.   

[APPLAUSE]   

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

Well, thanks, John, I’m still happy to argue that and it’s the 

truth—  It’s good to be back on the Upper West Side, let me say I 

grew up just a mile from here, Bella Abzug was my 

Congresswoman.  [LAUGHTER]  And that made me a

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 11. 

 

 

 

conservative.  Right.  [LAUGHTER]   A decision I’ve not regretted, 

since then.  Bush was not my first choice, George W. Bush was 

not my first choice for the Republican nomination for the 

Presidency in 2000, I’ve had my quarrels with the Bush 

administration, but he’s been a pretty good President.  He’s, it’s—  

Well…  [LAUGHTER]   

 

As we sit here safely, seven years after 9-11, having won a war in 

Iraq, we can snicker and laugh with the US economy having 

grown 18 percent over the last eight years, faster than any other 

Western advanced country, with the prescription drug benefits 

having been passed that has benefited many seniors which Bush 

gets no credit at all which he took on his own party for, on issues 

like immigration he valiantly took on his own party and did an 

awful lot to try to get that through.   Bush has actually been a 

pretty impressive President, it’s unfortunate that the public has, 

for various reasons, some of them good, soured on Bush, and 

he’s done a horrible job, his administration, of explaining what 

they’ve done and what the choices were.   

 

In the real world the choices are not, you know, perfection, and a 

pretty good Presidency, in the real world he’s made a lot of tough 

decisions, most of them correct.  When he became President al-

Qaeda was ascendant, Saddam Hussein was contained but

unsustainably so, unless you think we could’ve had sanctions 

and inspectors for the last eight years.  North Korea and Iran 

were secretly working on nuclear weapons programs, A. Q. Khan 

was dispensing nuclear material and know-how all over the 

world, Pakistan had exploded a nuclear weapon, in 1998.  Then, 

9-11, Bush reacted to that correctly, basically.   We have been 

protected here since then, we have al-Qaeda on the run 

internationally.  People can talk all they want about—there are a 

couple of things he did that he shouldn’t have done, these have 

been— they were fixed by people in his own administration.  Jack 

Goldsmith, Attorney General Ashcroft, Attorney General 

Mukasey, have fixed some of the mistakes that were made under 

the pressure of trying to defend this country against a ruthless 

terrorist group that had taken 3,000 lives,  history will look 

kindly on Bush’s performance as a national security and 

homeland security President.  And one piece of the proof is that 

Obama is not going to change much.  As the Obama people get 

briefed on the threats, they see that the surveillance program is 

necessary.  I suppose Obama will close Guantanamo and move, 

in effect, Guantanamo here to the United States and put the 

people at Fort Leavenworth but he’s not going to release these 

people into the US.   Enhanced interrogation techniques which 

McCain and Obama oppose, so I guess I’m a lonely person in 

defending those, saved an awful lot of lives when used on Khalid

Sheik Mohammed and I’m not willing to second-guess the 

decision, to use those techniques.   

 

Bush was a strong President on national security, the decision to 

go into Iraq was necessary I think.  The Middle East today, with 

Saddam in power, or his sons in power, with terror connections, 

redeveloping the weapons of mass destruction programs 

presumably, since I don’t think we could’ve kept sanctions on, 

and inspectors in for eight years, would’ve been a much more 

dangerous place.  The decision to go with the surge was a 

courageous decision, made in December 2006, January 2007 

under great adverse pressure, with very little public support,  

very little support from the Republican establishment, no 

support, obviously from almost any Democrats except Joe 

Lieberman.  It was the right decision, it’s been utterly vindicated.  

Have we ever seen really, this kind of real-time test.   Bush said 

let’s do this, here’s what will happen, here’s how we’ll work, these 

critics said it can’t work, it wasn’t working, you’re crazy, more 

lives are gonna be thrown away, and we had a real-time test of 

who was right and who was wrong.   

 

And now Barack Obama of course being an intelligent person, 

admits that the surge worked, and we are now beginning to draw 

down in a position of success in Iraq, not leaving a country that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 14. 

 

 

 

would’ve been a breeding ground for terror, I mean the degree to 

which Bush does not get enough credit, for refusing to cut and 

run in 2007 in Iraq, the degree to which people don’t appreciate 

the strategic, the geostrategic disaster that would’ve been, 

remains kind of amazing to me.  We have a pretty good outcome 

in Iraq, a very important ally in the Middle East, that has 

sacrificed a lot in fighting terror groups, that is standing with us 

against Iran, that has signed just a Status of Forces agreement 

with us, that will be a strategic partner with us.   

 

In a way this could be a strategic victory that could be the flip-

side of the strategic defeat that the Iranian revolution in 1979, 

was.  The rest of Bush’s foreign policy has been…I have my 

quarrels with some of it, but most of it’s been pretty successful, 

the relationship with India, the management of the China and 

Japan relationships.  The Europeans have been annoyed at Bush 

at various times, on the other hand we’re working more closely 

with Europe on Iran than we ever have before, and for all the talk 

about the US image in the world, the truth is, Barack Obama’s 

not going to change those policies much at all.   And I think it’s 

good as an America, if we get a lot of credit now with Obama and 

people decide they like us better but the actual policies, the 

NATO policies, the Afghanistan policies, the Iran policies, the 

Pakistan-India policies, the China policies, are not going to

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 15. 

 

 

 

change much.  Because they’re sensible pollicies.   

 

On the economy, obviously that’s been terrible in the last few 

months, I do think Bush could’ve done some things differently 

but to be fair, it’s not as if the Democrats had one prescription 

and Bush had another, and we went down one road and that’s 

where we are.  There were bipartisan mistakes, on some of the 

institutions like Fannie and Freddie.  I’d say Bush was more 

correct than the Democrats, on others, he might’ve been 

somewhat less correct.  We did have economic growth over these 

eight years, on the other hand, the big piece of deregulation that 

everyone loves to site as being the kind of key that unlocked the 

derivatives and the other instruments that have turned out to be, 

that spiraled out of control, the key that unlocked that was 

presumably the 1999 deregulation of financial institutions signed 

by Bill Clinton.   

 

Bush didn’t [WARNING TONE] sign any big deregulatory bill.  So 

he gets a bit of a bum rap on the economy but, I won’t, I won’t 

make that my leading argument, for why Bush was a successful 

President, but the prescription drug benefit has worked very well.   

It has preserved competition while coming in under budget and 

helped a lot of seniors, aid for Africa has worked well, Bush has 

fought for free trade against a Democratic Party that has tried to

turn its back on free trade and would…hopefully Obama will 

follow Bush and not some of his fellow Democrats in that way.    

The proof is in the pudding.  Obama is not going to change many 

Bush policies.  So it’s a little ridiculous to say, Bush is the worst 

President in 50 years, Barack Obama’s an intelligent, impressive 

man.  He promises change, I hope he brings some change.  But 

the fact of the matter is, Obama’s Presidency will be in most 

major respects, a continuation of the Bush Presidency, and that’s 

a good thing for the country.   

[LAUGHTER]

Thank you, Bill Kristol.  Simon Jenkins is a journalist and an 

author and writes a column for The Guardian, he is a British 

subject, he is a friend of America, but has never hesitated to tell 

America when he thinks it has made mistakes, ladies and 

gentlemen, Simon Jenkins, arguing for the motion.

SIMON JENKINS 

Well ladies and gentlemen, I just heard a wonderful suggestion, 

Barack Obama is going to be the second-worst President since 

the war.  [LAUGHTER]  The only thing I think that might make 

you, or many of you at least, not agree that George Bush is the 

worst American President of 50 years, is to hear somebody say it 

in a British accent.  [LAUGHTER]  I’m acutely aware of the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 17. 

 

 

 

sensitivity of international comment.  I am a deep skeptic about 

my own government, and I will not say much good of Gordon 

Brown, I won’t say a lot of good about hereditary monarchy.  But 

if I hear someone with an American accent insult my Queen I’ll 

hit them.  [LAUGHTER]    

 

There is something about foreign accents on these subjects, that 

gets people’s backs up, so I beg your pardon.  The point I want to 

make is this.  That there are really two American Presidents.  

There’s a President of the United States of America, and that is 

entirely your business.   But there’s a second American 

President.  And he is the President of the Western Alliance, and 

in many senses since the end of the Cold War, is seen as a sort of 

President of the rest of the world.  I’ve just been in Syria and 

Lebanon.  A lady speaking at a meeting made a rather moving 

remark.   She said every single one of us round the world, went to 

the polls on November the 4th, but only some of us were let in.  

The vast majority disenfranchised, sat outside, while America 

decided on their economy, on their diplomacy, on their politics, in 

many cases on their lives.   

 

And it’s to that American President that I want to say a few words 

tonight.  I’ve spent almost all my life cheerleading for America.  

I’m second to nobody in this noble cause.  And I can tell you it’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 18. 

 

 

 

not been easy this past eight years.  But until the last eight 

years, I have always felt, that each American President, in some 

small sense, pushed uphill the great boulder of democratic 

freedom.   Every single one, I felt at the end of it, yeah, America’s 

done it again.  We’ve made a bit of progress.  I felt that was one of 

the great strengths of America, that it could push that boulder a 

bit uphill.  It may have been a military intervention, it may have 

been a trade agreement, may have been a single example.   

 

Whatever it was, somehow or other, there was progress forward 

with what I call the great American crusade.  When George Bush 

came to power I was rather in favor of him.  I rather admired the 

program he put forth with this foreign policy.   Condoleezza Rice’s 

famous article on a humble foreign policy, definitely appealed to 

me.  I liked the remark about America setting the world an 

example by what it did at home, rather than by getting the 82nd 

Airborne to lead kids to school.   This seemed to me to be a 

refreshing, unbombastic, unostentatious diplomacy.  Then came 

9-11.  And I’ve always remembered those few weeks after 9-11, 

when the whole world was pro-American.  Yasir Arafat gave blood 

for New Yorkers.  Many people forget that.   Almost nobody, 

almost nobody, was not on America’s side for those two or three 

weeks.  And the disaster that followed, going to war in…true 

retaliation for it, is something from which I don’t think American

policy has ever recovered.   

 

I’ve recently been touring around that arc of instability, and the 

consequences of the consequences of 9-11 really have been 

catastrophic.  To pretend that Iraq is a success is obscene.  Iraq 

today is more or less back to what it was like in 2004 and if Karl 

or Bill want to walk hand in hand with me down Haifa Street in 

Baghdad, as you could still in 2004, well, I can tell you they 

won’t.   Afghanistan is heading in exactly the same direction, I 

think Afghanistan’s going to be a far worse mistake than Iraq.  

But in every single theater that you look, with the possible 

exception of Japan which had been eccentrically mentioned, you 

will see what I can only describe as the wrong decisions taken.   

 

Iran should not be a [UNCLEAR] at the moment, it should much 

more like Egypt, and it could’ve been.  There’s no reason for 

undermining the Pakistan government to the extent it has been 

undermined by American military intervention there. Russia, a 

putative friend eight years ago, is now a serious menace.  

Wherever you look, you see what I call the crashes down the road 

of neoconservatism, littering the highway of world affairs.  This 

was unnecessary, it was not required by circumstance, it was 

choice, it was decisions made in Washington.   Now those of us 

who feel very strongly about America, always regarded the basis

on which America operated out of its area, America went abroad 

to do things, was that it had a sort of moral superiority.  There 

was behind what it did, a backbone.  And that backbone was the 

backbone on which those people who approved of American 

intervention abroad always relied on. 

 

I’m afraid under the leadership of the last eight years, that 

backbone has snapped.  It has been simply impossible to tell 

countries elsewhere in the world that the American example, that 

the American intention, that the American execution of its 

intervention has been for the best.  People just don’t see it that 

way.  If you go round many of these countries today, and I mean 

today, you see the most extraordinary faith put in the next

If you go round the world today, you will find the most 

extraordinary faith in the person you’ve elected as your next 

President.  I have never come across anything like it.  A totally 

naïve belief, that this is the messiah, Barack Obama, has come to 

save not you, but everybody.   He will solve the Middle East.  He 

will get out of Iraq, he’ll get out of Afghanistan, he’ll pacify

Pakistan, he’ll make friends with Iran.  Ludicrous expectations 

are placed on the shoulders of this man.  The reason why that’s 

happened is because people simply have despaired over the last 

eight years.   The reason why, I think, unrealistic but possibly 

disastrous expectations are made of Barack Obama, is that, 

George Bush, for better or for worse, George Bush, has caused 

such a catastrophe in so many countries around the world.  I 

congratulate you on voting for Obama, I hope you will vote for

those of you sensitive to sulfur and brimstone, I apologize, 

nothing I can do about it.  I’d like to spend my time talking about 

the drive-by’s we just saw.  Let’s start with education.  We say a 

drive-by on No Child Left Behind.  Sure, we said states should set 

standards.  We didn't set one national standard, because we 

wanted the people in New York and the people in New Mexico to 

be engaged in setting standards for their states, and to be 

involved in setting up a system that they would buy into.  And in 

the five years since No Child Left Behind has come into force 

around this country, which requires every state to set standards, 

and to test every child grades three through eight to find out if 

the children are meeting the standards for reading, writing, and 

other material, we have seen more improvement in reading and 

math and science scores in those five years than we’ve seen in 

the twenty-eight previous years combined.  And the scores have 

gone up most… [APPLAUSE]  The scores have gone up most 

among minority communities, black and brown and poor and 

rural.  We heard about immigration, with a, a line that said, 

somehow or other the President threw in with the immigration 

restrictions.  You know what, I don’t think that bill we brought to 

the floor of the United States Senate was an immigration 

restrictions bill.  It was a bill that resolved the problem in a 

comprehensive way, and the President showed courage by 

standing for it and making it possible.  PEPFAR.  I heard a

dismissal of this incredible effort, by the generosity of the 

American people, that is today providing over two million people 

in Africa with life saving retroviral drugs.  Now sure, we insist 

upon encouraging programs to have to educate people about 

abstinence and faithfulness within marriage, and how those can 

help break the cycle of the spread of AIDS.  And it’s working.  

[APPLAUSE]  And free trade, I love this one, I love this one.  I sat 

there and was part of the team that bled to win trade promotion 

authority, and you know how many votes we won it by?  One.  We 

got CAFTA, which was a no-brainer, should have been a no-

brainer.  You know how many votes we got it by?  One.  I sat 

there in that room, in the cabinet room with twenty-two 

Democrats who voted for NAFTA, and China, and TPA under 

Clinton, who could not bring themselves to vote for free trade 

under this President.  Why?  Politics.  So, I appreciate the 

enthusiasm that some of our adversaries here at tonight’s debate 

have for free trade, and I'm looking forward to working with them 

in common cause on behalf of every free trade measure that 

comes before the United States Congress.   And why don’t we 

make a pact that we’ll start with Columbia?  Why don’t we do 

that.  [APPLAUSE]  Now, about that invasion of Iraq, I 

appreciated hearing about how it was done on a false premise, 

and hearing those words come from the mouth of somebody who 

wrote eloquently about the need to remove Saddam Hussein from

flop now.  [LAUGHTER]  Easy to flip flop now.  Look, do we wish 

we had the, that the weapons were there?  And it was justified 

under those terms?  Yeah.  [LAUGHTER]  You know what?  

[LAUGHTER]  You know what, though?  [AUDIENCE BOOS] 

Smart people, like Bill Clinton and Al Gore and John Kerry and 

our new Secretary of State designate sat on the floor of the 

Congress or at the White House in the nineties, or in the 

Congress in the 2000’s and said Saddam Hussein had weapons 

of mass destruction.   And we now know that there was a reason 

why he didn't have them, but he wanted us to think he had them.  

He told his interrogators he felt it made him look big in the 

neighborhood, and he, and we know from two reports by, by Kay 

and Duefler, that Saddam Hussein was intent upon recreating 

these programs the moment the West lost its interest in him.  So 

he literally siphoned tens of millions of dollars out of the Food for 

Peace Program to do two things, to keep together the engineers 

and the scientists and the technicians to reconstitute these 

programs, and to keep the dual use facilities to rapidly 

reconstitute particularly the chemical and biological programs.  

Now, I loved also being lectured about sabotaging unity after 

9/11.  I sat there in those meetings on Homeland Security, where 

we had a great consensus about the need to defend the homeland 

by reorganizing our government, and the Democrats insisted on

one thing, that the Department of Homeland Security should not 

be subject to the same constrictors regarding union membership 

that John F. Kennedy put in place for the rest of the government 

in 1961, and that Jimmy Carter signed into law in 1979.  They 

wanted the Department of Agriculture and the Department of 

Transportation to be governed by strictures that said, in a time of 

national security, certain elements of the agency could be 

declared off limits for union organizing, but they didn't want that 

same rule to apply to one department in the government, The 

Department of Homeland Security.  Because they saw it as a sop 

for their union allies.  That was not national unity in the 

aftermath of 9/11, and it was an absence of national unity, 

because there were Democrats in the Congress who never 

accepted the legitimacy of this President.  Talk about the 

mismanagement of the economy.  Let’s talk about it.  The Dow 

down thirty-eight percent, the NASDAQ down seventy-eight 

percent.  The S&P down fifty percent.  Six trillion dollars lost in 

value in one year.  I'm not talking about today, I'm talking about 

March 2000, when the markets started to go down and bottomed 

out in October of 2002.  Thank God this President had the 

wherewithal and the political capital and the moxie to pass a 

large effective stimulus package of one point six trillion dollars 

over ten years that got the economy growing again by long lasting 

tax cuts that benefited everybody in America who pays taxes.

of every twenty American workers who were employed in 2001 

and 2002 would not have been employed were it not for the tax 

cuts.  Now, we’ve heard some other things, Fannie, and we’ve 

heard about Yassir Arafat, giving blood in the aftermath of 9/11. 

[LAUGHTER]  Well, as long as America wasn’t going to throw over 

Israel as our ally and friend, that was going to be a temporary act 

of friendship, and an enduring life of hate.  And Iran, it’s 

somehow our fault, Bush’s fault, that the Ayatollah’s, and the 

Mullah’s, and the lunatics are pursuing a nuclear weapon in 

Iran?  I think that has to do with their decision to pursue a 

nuclear weapon, not us making them do it.

audience, again, reminding you to keep your questions focused

have the numbers that tell us your opinions as you came off the 

street tonight.  On our motion that George W. Bush is the worst 

president of the last fifty years, that Bush 43 is the worst 

president of the last fifty years, sixty-five percent of you are for 

the motion, seventeen percent against, and eighteen percent 

undecided.  And again, as we said at the beginning, we tend to 

judge success in this debate by how much you can actually move 

those numbers.  So, if that sixty-five percent goes up, the side for 

will have prevailed, if the seventeen percent that is against goes 

up, that side will be seen to have prevailed.

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

This is a question for any member of the panel.  What president 

in the last fifty years has faced the challenges that Bush 43 has 

faced?   

JOHN DONVAN  

Very good, and very sharp and focused question.  Bill Kristol.   

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

Every president faces challenges, and obviously each different.   

But I think if you're implying that Bush faced particularly 

stark challenges, with a plummeting economy as he took over, 

and then of course 9/11, for which the government wasn’t 

prepared, the country wasn’t prepared, the Bush 

administration frankly wasn’t prepared, but certainly the 

Clinton administration hadn't done much to help prepare for, I 

think the President reacted well to the challenges he faced.  

And that is what makes someone a reasonably successful 

president.  He made mistakes, as he said recently in the 

interview.  You know, he wasn’t, he hadn't realized he was 

going to have to fight two wars, no one thought we would do 

that, be doing that in October of 2000.  He adjusted in the 

conduct of those wars, I think pretty well, and the same with 

Homeland Security, they made a couple of mistakes, but 

basically ended up, thank God, I think, hardening this country 

in a pretty effective way, and putting al Qaeda on the run by 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

taking the offensive.  I really don’t understand this, I mean,  

Pakistan, poor Bush, he gets criticized not promoting 

democracy in Pakistan enough.  Then we promote democracy 

in Pakistan, we have elections, we actually have a rather good 

leader of Pakistan, now he has a corrupt past, but has said the 

right things about trying to curb…  Well, you can laugh about 

it, but it’s a tough place to govern.  He’s trying to curb the ISI 

and the terrorists.  We’re now going in aggressively in the 

northwest frontier to take out al Qaeda.  I don’t think that’s a 

mistake.  I think Obama is right to support Bush on that.  So, 

I think Bush adjusted well to very difficult circumstances.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jacob Weisberg, the implication of that question is that no 

president could have done well with these circumstances.  What 

do you think of that?   

JACOB WEISBERG 

Well I disagree with that.  Every president until, through Bush’s 

father, had to manage the Cold War which was infinitely more 

threatening to the existence of civilization than September 11th 

was.  And in particular, if you want a particularly specific 

example, John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis, which 

probably brought us closer to Armageddon than we’ve ever been.   

And the way Kennedy personally managed that crisis, if you’ve 

ever seen the movie Thirteen Days, or listened to any of the tapes,

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

is an amazing story, because he rejected the advice of very 

powerful people in his administration who claimed to know a lot 

more than he did.  But his instincts were very good, and he made 

the decision that saved us all.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Audience questions.  I'm going to collect a couple.  To the right 

here, and then I want to get to the other side, I see a white sleeve 

halfway up, keep that hand waving and we’ll get a microphone to 

you.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Thank you.  This is a question for Mr. Rove.  I have great belief in 

the wisdom of the gross American population.  If what you have 

said about the Bush successes is true, how is it that his general, 

approval record is so extraordinarily and historically low.   

JOHN DONVAN  

OK, I'm going to hold that question, Karl, and collect a couple of 

others.  But we will come to it.  The gentleman with the white 

sleeve we spoke of?   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

This is also a question for Mr. Rove.  If the United States is 

known for its Constitution and for respect for the rule of law, how 

would you rate the Bush presidency?  And as a follow-up 

question, why would you not testify in a criminal investigation 

related to abuse of government power?  Thank you.

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 31. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN  

All right.  We’re going to take these two questions.  Now, these 

questions are to Karl, but I see an opening a truck could drive 

through for your opponents to also be part of this conversation.  

Karl, the first question, why are the President’s approval ratings 

so low?   

KARL ROVE 

Yeah, well look, we’re asking, it’s an unpopular war, and we’re 

asking the country to do tough things for a long time.  And the 

economy’s bad.  I would remind you, not to correct Mr. Weisberg, 

but there have been three presidents who have had lower 

approval ratings that I'm aware of, Carter, well actually four, 

Carter, Nixon, Johnson, and Truman.  Truman left office with 

numbers lower than this President’s.  History has judged each of 

these men differently after their departure.  If I could respond to 

the second one, rule of law.  First of all, I'm not aware that I’ve 

refused to testify in a criminal investigation.  You may know 

something I don’t know.  You want to elucidate?  I think what 

you may be suggesting is why will I not testify in front of the 

United States Congress?  And the reason is because I believe in 

the rule of law.  The rule of law that says there’s a separation of 

powers between the executive and the legislative branches, and 

that the President of the United States has a right to receive 

confidential advice form his assistants, which has been upheld by 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 32. 

 

 

 

the United States Supreme Court.  Now, right now it’s being re-

litigated again, because the United States Senate did not like the 

answer the White House gave them in the summer of July, in the 

summer of 2007.  If I'm called upon, and a court of law says that 

the President has no such right, I’ll testify.  In the House of 

Representatives and in the Senate, we have made numerous 

attempts to provide the Congress with the information that it’s 

requested, in a way that protects the right of a President and his 

prerogative to receive that kind of advice from his staff, from his 

confidential advisors.  The Senate has refused to take any one of 

the options.  The House refused to take five separate options that 

we gave them, until finally, some members of the House 

Judiciary Committee asked the questions that were being asked 

by the Committee, and sent them to me.  And under penalty, I 

responded to those, and if you like, you can find my answers at 

Rove.com.  So, I’ve answered them.  But, there is a rule of law, 

and we ought to respect that rule of law that says there is a 

separation of powers between the branches, and that’s exactly 

why I’ve been directed by the President not to testify in front of 

Congress on these issues.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Simon Jenkins, I want to bring you into the conversation.  We, 

the issue, that question was premised on the notion that 

America’s image has always rested on its adherence to the rule of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 33. 

 

 

 

law, and that the years of the Bush administration have, to some 

degree, to seem to have been a disintegration of the value of the 

Constitution.  With Barack Obama now taking over, does the fact 

that he has this terrible image with which to compare himself, 

give him a boost, or does the fact that American leadership have 

been so diminished, respect for America has been so diminished, 

give him a terrible starting point?  

SIMON JENKINS 

Well, I think the origin of this whole part of the discussion is the 

response to 9/11.  9/11 is the starting point of almost everything 

that we’ve been talking about.  And I think many people in 

Europe, and around the world, simply feel that America over-

reacted, and so did Britain, I may say.  So, this is not something 

peculiar to America.  It was a feeling that some new force had 

been unleashed on the world to which we had to respond by 

restricting our normal customary defenses and liberty.  I'm a 

libertarian, and I feel that was, I’ve always felt that was simply 

unnecessary, the reaction was an overreaction.  The consequence 

of it, however, is that we have, in a sense, played the terrorist’s 

game.  We’ve done what they wanted us to do, which was restrict 

our liberties, curb our liberties, behave in a certain way towards 

other States and other peoples that we would not normally have 

done before.  And—

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 34. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN  

But I heard Bill Kristol saying, and Bill, let me bring you into 

this, I’ve heard you say that, when it comes to terrorism, rather 

than playing the terrorist’s game, that the President has 

succeeded in putting the terrorists on the run, which is why 9/11 

was the only incident in this city.   

SIMON JENKINS 

Would that they were on the run.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Bill Kristol.   

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

Well, they haven't been very successful here, and they haven't 

been very successful in Western Europe, and they’ve actually not 

been very successful elsewhere.  Al Qaeda has been a losing 

proposition for the last several years.  It remains a huge problem 

of, a jihadist impulse in the Islamic world, which is, 

unfortunately, abetted by certain states.  But I think Bush has 

done a pretty good, well, a very good job of making terror a losing 

proposition, which is the most important thing he could have 

done, taken away their momentum, which again, if we had not 

gone into Iraq, and if we had lost in Iraq, that would have been 

the single most disastrous result.  Bush turned that around.  But 

I just don’t buy this premise that we’ve radically curved civil 

liberties.  Bush has done less after the 9/11 attack than any 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

other President has done, much,  much less, he’s much more 

responsible than Franklin Roosevelt was after we were attacked 

in World War II.  He’s been much more solicitous of civil liberties 

than, if I might say, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were 

during, and Richard Nixon were, during Vietnam.  We’ve had, you 

know, some controversial calls, and some tough calls.  There 

were a couple of over-reactions which the Bush administration 

itself walked back, Jack Goldsmith and Attorney General 

Mukasey have, I think, corrected some controversial 

interpretations that probably went too far—

Bill, can I interrupt you—

But the point is you--I'm amazed by--I appreciate how open

liberties issues, you're amazingly cavalier.  Closing Guantanamo 

is no big deal, we have them here, we have them there.  Torture, 

you won't second guess the decisions.   I mean, these go to the 

heart of the questions about the rule of law and the Constitution, 

and the question of whether terror suspects… [APPLAUSE]

Bush— 

JACOB WEISBERG 

The question— 

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

Bush has lost fewer court decisions than almost any president 

has.  He lost two five to four decisions.  You can, maybe the five 

were right, maybe Bush shouldn't have gone quite as far as he 

did in some of the claims he made about Guantanamo.  But we 

are going to have to detain people.  We are not going to be able to 

provide them all civil trials.   I do not believe that is a way you 

can deal with terrorists captured on the battlefield.

KARL ROVE 

You know, we got eight percent of the vote in one of the precincts 

up here, I mean, come on, man!  Come on!  [LAUGHTER]  All 

right, look, it’s clever to suggest that we ought to have the 

military, the style of courtroom justice we provide to our military,

and provide that for enemy non-combatants, I mean enemy 

combatants.  We shouldn't.  That’s what we attempted to do in 

the military justice system, is to the greatest possible degree 

possible duplicate our civil justice system.  And are you 

suggesting that we ought to Mirandize these people and keep a 

chain of evidence and all the other things that we normally do in 

both military and civilian courts for terrorists?  [APPLAUSE]  

JACOB WEISBERG 

Not at all, and people have far fewer rights under the military 

system.  But the point is, under your system, they have no rights.  

The prisoners at Guantanamo were originally denied access to a 

lawyer, we couldn't even find out who was there, and the original 

claim by the Bush administration was that this applied to 

citizens as well as non-citizens.  So, if the Bush administration 

decided that you were suspected of terrorism, you could be held 

indefinitely without a lawyer, without a hearing, without a trial.   

KARL ROVE 

You know what— 

JACOB WEISBERG 

I'm not saying that these— 

KARL ROVE

the Upper West Side needs to worry about being sent to the 

reeducation camps in Texas.  And in reality what it was focused

at is, if we picked up a US Citizen who was a terrorist on a 

battlefield abroad, would we subject him to US law, or would we 

treat them as a terrorist— 

JACOB WEISBERG 

But here’s what you slipped in, if we picked up someone who’s a 

terrorist.  What if they happen not to be a terrorist?  Some of 

these people have been acquitted.  [APPLAUSE]

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

Was the Bush administration bad at explaining their policies, 

especially abroad?  Yes.  Did people abroad take a kind of 

cavalier and really, hypocritical sense of pleasure in decrying 

those ridiculous Americans with all this stuff?  While they 

themselves, of course, as you know well, in Continental Europe, 

treat their own citizens with many less rights, are much, much 

nastier to their minorities, Bush went out of his way, and with 

great success, to say this is not a war on Islam, we need to 

protect everybody’s rights, he was incredibly solicitous, as he 

should have been of Muslim-Americans, Muslim-Americans here 

have a much fairer and more equal playing field than Muslims do 

in most of these wonderful European countries that sit around 

having heart attacks about two hundred people held at 

Guantanamo… [APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN 

Simon, let’s— 

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

And let’s just talk, Bush made two Supreme Court appointments, 

they were incredibly highly qualified.  Alito, sixty-one

appointments to Federal courts.  Whatever, they were 

conservative, of course, as Obama’s will be liberal, extremely 

highly qualified judges.  He made a couple of mistakes, I think, in 

his appointments, out of excessive loyalty, perhaps with Alberto 

Gonzales, but the fact is, Ashcroft was a serious Attorney 

General, and then he brought in Mukasey, and he’s leaving an 

intact and functioning legal system which we can be proud of 

given the threats we’re facing.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Simon Jenkins?

What I think is extraordinary to people abroad, is that those of us 

who are enthusiasts for America and American liberties cannot 

see why you needed to do these things.  You will never persuade 

the outside world that you have not restricted liberty in America.  

You will never persuade them that you have not taken out 

Muslims as a particular group, and you will never, and you never

administration has been by far the biggest spending 

administration with the possible exception of Lyndon Johnson.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Can, sir, can we ask you to start the question again?  Thank—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

In the last fifty years, this administration has been by far the 

biggest spending administration with the possible exception of 

Lyndon Johnson, and that’s even before spending on Homeland 

Security and Iraq.  What is your response to that.   

JOHN DONVAN  

OK, I want to go to the second question first.  On the question of 

September 11th, does President Bush deserve any blame for 

September 11th?   

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

We published in the Weekly Standard of, in July of 2001 an 

article by Reuel Marc Gerecht, who I think has participated in 

these debates, alarmed that we were not doing enough to fight al 

Qaeda, that they had bombed the USS Cole in October of 2000, 

and that neither the Bush administration, nor the Congress, the 

Democrats, Republicans, really understood how serious the 

threat of al Qaeda was.  I think the Bush administration would 

say, I mean, I think Conde Rice and others have said this, that 

they now wish, of course, they had been more alarmed and more 

alert as they had taken office in those first few months.  So  yes, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 48. 

 

 

 

there is blame to go around on 9/11.  But fundamentally, the 

growth of al Qaeda, the ability of al Qaeda, which was key to have 

the terror training camps unmolested in Afghanistan, is not 

something that primarily happened under Bush.   

JACOB WEISBERG 

Can we just, one more word on this, because if you read Richard 

Clarke’s book, or some of the other inside accounts of this, it’s 

clear, it’s not that nobody had heard of al Qaeda, Richard Clarke, 

for example, was running around with his hair on fire about how 

dangerous this threat was.   And it’s clear that Bush, in the early 

days, downplayed it, rejected it, didn't take it seriously, and did 

so because it had been a particular focus of the Clinton 

administration, and he was reversing policy.  [APPLAUSE]  

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

The focus…?  If it was such a focus of the Clinton Administration, 

it would be nice to know what they did about it, since— 

JACOB WEISBERG 

Well they… [APPLAUSE]

…on Osama bin Laden— 

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

One series of— 

JACOB WEISBERG 

They missed.  Bush hasn’t got him either.  They started a little 

later.  Anyway…   

JOHN DONVAN  

A question you were asked, who is the worst President of the last 

fifty years?   

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

Look, I mean this is a, you know, this is why this question is a 

little artificial.  I mean, Lyndon Johnson probably made the worst 

mistake, perhaps, of the last fifty years, with Vietnam, but he 

also deserves a huge amount of credit, I think, and I’ll say this as 

a conservative and a Republican, some of what he did in terms of, 

certainly, civil rights, and I would say something like Medicare.  

So, people are not, you know, univocally good or bad.  I do think, 

at the same time, personal, corruption of the political system for 

political, of the judicial system, and of the governmental system 

for political ends, clearly Nixon.  And I would say in terms of just 

incompetence and leaving the country in dangerous shape which 

had to be reversed, Carter.  So, the seventies was a bad decade, 

in my opinion, for American presidents, and for America, and for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

the world.  Which was reversed by Reagan.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Karl Rove, we had a questioner say that President Bush was a big 

spender.  

KARL ROVE 

Yeah, look, I like how first of all you did put, say put aside 

Homeland Security.  Let’s take a look at discretionary domestic 

spending.  The last budget left to us, the FY ’01 budget, left to us 

by that previous President whose name you can fill in, increased 

discretionary domestic spending in FY ’01 fifteen percent in one 

year.  That means that would double the discretionary spending 

of the Federal government, if left at that rate, in five and a half 

years.  We cut, in our first budget, FY ’02, discretionary domestic 

spending to seven percent, in FY ’03 to four percent, in FY ’04, 

excuse me, FY ’05, two percent, and six, seven, and eight, have 

flat lined discretionary domestic spending of the government.  

Been hard to do.  We’re going to leave a big, we’re going to leave 

an enormous benefit in place for Barack Obama in that we have 

flat lined discretionary domestic spending.  [AUDIENCE 

REACTION]   

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

And the biggest, and the biggest spending item is, are two things, 

the tax cuts, we can debate economic policy, but I think an awful 

lot of people think especially 2003 tax cuts were sensible and 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

ended up producing, actually, a lot of revenue.  And prescription 

drug benefit, which I would defend as a conservative.  Medicare 

exists, it is a pretty good program, it had to be improved, it had to 

be updated by bringing prescription drugs into it.  It’s come in 

under budget, and I think, what, ninety-two percent of seniors 

are covered, and it seems to be working pretty well.  Now, if 

you're a strict, small government libertarian conservative, you 

would object to Bush starting a new entitlement program, and 

that’s a defensible, philosophical position, but in that case, the 

biggest domestic expenditure, the biggest piece of domestic 

legislation of the Bush administration, it did what Bush said it 

was going to do.   

JOHN DONVAN

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER    

The question is for Mr. Rove.  Had the intelligence been accurate 

prior to the invasion of Iraq, would the invasion have still taken 

place, in your view?   

KARL ROVE 

No.  In the aftermath of 9/11 the concern was about a tyrant 

guilty of enormous human rights abuses, but possessed with 

weapons of mass destruction and an intention to use them as a 

state sponsor of terror.  Absent that, I suspect the 

administration’s course would have been to work to find more 

creative ways to constrain him than he’d been constrained in the 

nineties.  The President did have an enormous concern about the 

human rights abuses under Saddam Hussein.  He also had a 

concern about the deterioration of the credibility of the United 

Nations, which had passed sixteen resolutions calling upon him 

to abide by the outcome and the agreements that he made in the 

aftermath of the ’91, of the first Gulf War, that he’d not lived up 

to.  But absent weapons of mass destruction, no, I don’t think 

there would have been an invasion.

This is for Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Weisberg.  You’ve criticized 

President Bush for going to war with Iraq.  If President Bush had 

not decided to go to war with Iraq and had only decided to go to 

war with Afghanistan to fight terrorism, do you think Saddam 

Hussein would have, A, remained a neutral and impartial 

observer in the war between Islamic terrorists and the West; B, 

allied with the United States in an effort to stamp out Islamic 

terrorists and bring democracy to Afghanistan; or C, grown a 

dangerous supporter and protector of Islamic terrorists, including

al Qaeda and others.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Simon and Jacob, why don’t you take that.   

SIMON JENKINS 

We have a problem here.  I just don’t see terrorism as a state 

projected force in the way that you do.  I regard it in the sense 

that the question was trying to ask before, as a criminal act of 

gangsters roaming the world, and badly in need of curtailing by 

their own governments.  I think the way we treated international 

terrorism is to glorify it, to give it the status of a state.  We’ve 

given huge recruiting energy to those people who want to bring 

young people into this particular odious fold, and I think by 

declaring war on some governments, I may say not all 

governments that harbor them, we’ve accorded them a status 

wholly beyond what they deserve.  I believe that my country and 

your country’s overstated this threat.  I just think we’ve overdone 

it.  And in overdoing it, we turned very large numbers of 

countries in the, particularly in the Islamic world, into state 

menaces.  They themselves are undermined by the status we’ve 

given to these people.  Pakistan being a classic case of that.  This 

is quite a cosmic question.  If you declare a very small group of 

people to be an international menace, you turn them into a sort 

of hero, and we’ve done that, and it’s been a terrible, terrible 

mistake.

JOHN DONVAN 

Jacob?  

[APPLAUSE]  

JACOB WEISBERG 

Mr. Rove mentioned somewhere in that incredible litany of 

distortions that… [LAUGHTER]  that I was in favor of getting rid 

of Saddam Hussein.  I was, as were a lot of sensible people.  I 

didn't happen to favor doing it the way Bush did, largely 

unilaterally, rejecting allies, as opposed to building pressure on 

Saddam, and not waiting for the inspection process to play out.  

But I think the point is, and what we’ve subsequently learned, 

and the problem I had that Bush didn't have, was I did not have 

access to analysts from the Department of Energy trying to tell 

everybody that those aluminum tubes were not for nuclear 

weapons.  But the point is that Saddam was being, had been 

successfully disarmed, and was being successfully contained, 

and he was not supporting international terrorism, because he 

was afraid to.  He was a miscalculator, a serial miscalculator, but 

he was not a mad man, and I think he understood very clearly 

that supporting terrorism against the United States would have 

resulted in the same thing that happened anyway, his 

destruction.  I think what would have happened if we didn't 

invade Iran, I’d actually like to turn the question around a little 

bit and ask Bill Kristol, for example, does he, knowing what we 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

know now, still think invading Iraq would make sense? But I 

think that we might have ended up having to take military action 

against Saddam Hussein at some point in the future.  But I think 

we could have done it with allies, I think we could have done it in 

a more thought out way, and I think we could have planned for 

an occupation, it could have been expected if we knew we were 

going to have to do it.   

[APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN  

Bill, I think that question to you was more than rhetorical, but I 

want you to take twenty seconds to answer it.   

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

I think Karl is right that we, that the President would not, in fact, 

have gone to war if he had known what seems to be the case, that 

Saddam had no real functioning weapons of mass destruction 

programs at the time.  I, having said that, so I think as an 

analytical manner Karl’s certainly right, the American political 

system wouldn't have supported it. Now, I think it was right to go 

to war to remove Saddam.  I think the Middle East would be 

incredibly much more dangerous if he were, or his sons were in 

power.  I think every radical state and every radical group would 

be empowered, because weakness is what empowers them, and 

he would have stood, stood down, in effect, the US, and the UN, 

and the civilized world.  It’s inconceivable we could have kept the

sanctions up.  They were already fraying.  It’s inconceivable, the 

inspectors were only in because we moved a hundred and fifty 

thousand troops next door.   They would have gone out, it would 

have been a horrible defeat for the West, and I think it would 

have,  we would have had a much more resurgent radicalism in 

the Islamic world than we have today, where I think it’s a mixed 

bag, that actually in many respects the terrorist groups are on 

the defensive and on the run.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Karl Rove, you had a question… [APPLAUSE]  You had a 

question, Karl Rove, about the future of the party particularly in 

its ability to be more diverse.  

KARL ROVE 

Well, after a loss, every political party goes through a period of 

introspection and rebuilding, and Republicans have to do that 

this time.  Let’s be clear, though, about what happened in this 

election, and that is that Barack Obama got three point one 

percent more than Al Gore got in 2000.  This is not the blow out 

that you might expect given the conditions of the economy and 

the unpopularity of the war.  This was not a sixty/forty victory.  

He got fifty-three percent of the vote.  He got seven point one 

million more votes than John Kerry got, and four out of every five 

were black or brown.  And therein lies the challenge for the 

Republican party.  The party of Lincoln needs to make a

concerted appeal for African-American votes, knowing that in the 

short term it is going to pay off not one twit, and in the long run, 

it has a moral obligation as a great political party to represent all 

Americans.  And it can only do that by making the case to 

African-Americans and Latinos.  And Republicans have a similar 

problem brewing among Latinos.  George Bush got forty-four 

percent of the vote among Latinos, John McCain, who was a 

courageous, early advocate of immigration reform, got thirty-one.  

We cannot take the largest, fastest growing minority in America 

and write it off like we did with African-Americans.   And then we 

also have a problem with the young, because let’s be candid, the 

war has turned young voters, eighteen to twenty-nine, against the 

war.  They voted for Obama by two to one, and they not only were 

against the war, they're against the Republicans.  And those 

three Republicans have got to work on.  But, on the other hand, 

Republicans had a victory, had a defeat this year that was not the 

blowout, and it was also the victory for Obama that was not as 

big as anticipated.  I, take, for example, Ronald Reagan in 1980, 

when he got elected, he brought in a hundred state senators with 

him, net, and three hundred members of state houses.  This time 

around Barack Obama brought in a net of ten state senators, and 

ninety-four house members.  This was an individual victory for a 

charismatic, articulate, inspiring individual, an historical figure, 

and the Democrats are going to make a mistake if they think this

We’re heading down the home stretch from questions from the

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

OK, as I tried to say before, my question is for mister Jenkins or 

Weisberg.  Some will say that George W. Bush’s most difficult 

decision, and maybe most courageous, is to treat terror—[BREAK 

IN AUDIO] …and not a criminal act.  I ask you, we’ve had 

decades to judge these, please name me the difficult and 

courageous decisions made by Lyndon Baines Johnson and 

Jimmy Carter that have been proven to be the right ones, please.

of the Iraq War and his rationale for the Iraq War, versus the 

rationale and prosecution of the Vietnam War by JFK, LBJ, and

Just one simple question, first of all, thank you all for coming 

here.  I'm curious, if an aspect of the success of the Bush 

presidency is his foreign policy, and his defending us against the, 

terrorism, then how do you explain the fact that no one has 

caught Osama bin Laden at this point, the chief architect of the

act that set all this off?  [APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN 

Karl Rove?  

KARL ROVE 

Because he is hiding in a deep, dark cave in a very dark corner 

of, in all likelihood, Pakistan.  And, to suggest that not every 

effort has been made to get him is inaccurate.  Every effort has 

been made to get him, to get at his communications, to get at his 

allies, to get at his subordinates, to get at his inner circle.   A lot 

of them are dead…and we aren’t hearing much from him.  

And…but we gotta recognize we’re dealing with an odd part of the 

world, this is not as Simon alluded to, this is not a state.  And it 

operates through states, the Taliban controlled a state, 

Afghanistan, that harbored and trained and gave succor to these 

terrorists.   But they live in a odd and dark part of the world that 

is not a state, and it’s what makes destroying al-Qaeda’s 

leadership and our relationship with Pakistan both two very 

problematic things.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Simon and Jacob, you had two questions along the lines of 

comparisons of George Bush to both Presidents Kennedy and 

Johnson, with I think the implication that, the President’s Iraq 

was their Vietnam, can you take on that question?

SIMON JENKINS 

When I was a very young journalist, was in Vietnam at the very 

end of that war, and attended the relevant briefings, and this is 

not a—a very well-informed comment but, my view was that the 

Vietnam war and occupation of South Vietnam, was far more 

competently executed than the occupation of Iraq.   The 

occupation of Iraq, was, and I followed American and British 

occupation troops around the world for most of my career—the 

occupation of Iraq was simply the most incompetent thing I’ve 

ever seen.  It was stupefyingly incompetent…  [APPLAUSE]  And 

I’ve no doubt at all that many people possibly on the platform 

wouldn’t disagree with that, because it was conducted by a very 

small group of people, against the advice of a much larger group 

of people within the administration.   It simply has been a 

catastrophe.  Afghanistan is much better conducted, although I 

think it’s a much more difficult war to fight.  And that’s why I 

think it’s gonna end in greater tears than Iraq will end, Iraq is 

fairly simple to end, you just leave.   It’ll be very, very difficult to 

leave Afghanistan.  But certainly in Vietnam, I think you had on 

the whole relatively competent military people there, they had 

experience in Korea many of them.  They lost but they only just 

lost.  I do think that America could’ve stabilized South Vietnam 

had it stayed longer.  It was not the right place to be and the right 

thing to do, but it was not a hopeless case.  I think when you go

into a country without a good reason, or with the purpose of 

simply punishing the country as was the case in both Iraq and 

Afghanistan, you’re not likely to do well, because you haven’t 

really plotted what the purpose of the exercise is, it was simply to 

punish.   And I think it’s that punitive element that’s been the 

problem, certainly in Iraq.  And I am sorry I’ve been there only 

twice, but I cannot accept that it is in any sense of the word a 

success.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jacob?    

JACOB WEISBERG 

Just on a—  [APPLAUSE]  Sorry to step on your well-deserved 

applause, Simon.  The… just on LBJ, the questioner asked what 

courageous thing did he ever do, just for starters, how about 

saying goodbye to the South for the Democratic Party for 

generations, [APPLAUSE] when he signed the Civil Rights Act in 

’64 and the Voting Rights Act in ’65.   Johnson knew that would 

be the political consequence of that decision and he did it 

anyway, to me that’s almost the definition of political courage.  

On judgement however I don’t think Johnson does so well in 

Vietnam and it’s quite comparable to Bush, I think—  I think 

both of them were very poor—I think both of them were 

essentially unable to admit error, to recognize error, and to 

reverse error.  And, whereas Johnson a slightly different story, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 65. 

 

 

 

and you know, you get into sort of psychological territory here 

but, Johnson clearly didn’t trust Kennedy’s advisors.  He had this 

longstanding issue with the Kennedy brothers and I think he was 

getting some good advice from some of the Kennedy people, but I 

think he couldn’t hear it because of who was giving it.  And 

likewise with Bush on Iraq, certainly the advice he got from Colin 

Powell at the very beginning not to invade Iraq was very good 

advice.  But I think Bush was so blinded by his own motives, 

whatever you think they were, that I think he effectively couldn’t 

hear that.  And then he couldn’t hear the very good advice that I 

said came from Bill Kristol, among other people that the strategy 

was failing and—  You know, it finally took just a series, I mean it 

got to the point really where there was a total consensus that the 

strategy was failed, and that Rumsfeld was failing and I think 

Bush postponed change until there was absolutely no choice.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, we’re coming down to our last few minutes of questions 

and I would like to make it a little bit forward-looking and I just 

wanna see if any of the hands up here are—have questions 

related to what President-Elect Obama inherits from Bush, is 

anybody thinking along those lines quite clearly, and don’t 

snooker me because I’ll squash your question if it’s…

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I think we all know that this issue won’t really be decided here 

tonight but it very well may be in 12 years, in 16 years, in 20 

years.  For those against the motion, can you paint us a picture 

of the world that would make your case?    

KARL ROVE 

[LONG PAUSE]  Yeah.  [LAUGHTER]  Iraq as a functioning semi-

democracy in the heart of the Middle East, as an example, that 

would be a powerful antidote to the terrorist image of what the 

future oughta be like.  Afghanistan stabilized, a continued 

decline in the ability of terrorist elements like al-Qaeda to 

threaten the West.   A continued diminution in their ability to 

recruit, which incidentally I think you may have seen or heard 

about the new report out which shows a dramatic decline in their 

operational capability and in their recruitment ability.  And a 

world where the institutions that the President is seeking to leave 

in place, like PEPFAR and the Millennium Challenge have 

revolutionized and changed America’s pattern of foreign 

assistance to focus on results, and transparency and 

accountability.   And new institutions whether it is the 

replacement for Kyoto with the G8 agreement this year to pursue 

a new international regime in which all the major emitters are at 

the table, and all the major emitters are focused on energy 

efficiency and technological advances that allow them to clean

the air and reduce greenhouse gases, like we have done, we’re 

the only economy, the last year for which numbers are available 

are 2006, there’s only one industrialized economy in the world 

that grows that year, and reduces the absolute level of 

greenhouse gases, it’s the United States of America because of 

the approach we’re pursuing.   

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

Great—   

KARL ROVE 

That’s how it would look abroad.    

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

Let me just add to that and just, very briefly, make it a little 

sharper perhaps.  Look, from 1979 on the Iranian revolution and 

the disastrous Saudi Wahhabi decision to compete with the 

Iranian revolution by exporting Wahhabi Islam much more 

aggressively abroad, enabled to do that by the, obviously oil 

revenues from the ‘70s, that they—once they were able to jack up 

oil prices in the ‘70s—  jihadism, Islamic jihadism, Islamic 

extremism, terrorism has been unfortunately on the rise doing 

some damage to us and huge damage obviously, within the 

Islamic world and in the Middle East, and the greater Middle East 

and in South Asia.  Successful Bush foreign policy, I mean, 

successful US foreign policy, which would have been begun by 

President Bush, 10 or 20 years from now, would’ve reversed that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 68. 

 

 

 

and I think we are on the cusp of reversing that.  I think that is 

why the intervention in Iraq, the stabilizing of Iraq as a non-

extremist, non-terror-friendly regime in the center of the Middle 

East, the crushing of al-Qaeda, and there’s some very difficult 

things to be done with Pakistan but at least so far maintaining 

some of the decent civilian government in Pakistan, while moving 

aggressively against the terror, parts of Pakistan that had been 

for quite a long time, terror-friendly, I mean that, reversing that 

would be incredibly important, that is really crucial to having a 

decent 21st century.   And I think Bush has begun to reverse it, 

there’s much more that has to be done, I trust that President 

Obama will do it.  And secondly nuclear weapons.  It’s amazing 

that we have had as little proliferation of nuclear weapons as 

we’ve had.   Many experts think over the last 50 years in 

retrospect the Pakistani explosion of nuclear weapons in ’98, and 

I was no more prescient about this than anyone else, was a huge 

moment, a very dangerous moment, and what A. Q. Khan was 

doing, unbeknownst to us and, you know, to others, was 

unbelievably dangerous and made possible the North Korea 

program, it’s made possible the Iranian program, it accelerated 

the Iranian program.  If we can prevent the spread of nuclear 

weapons, and that means preventing Iran from going nuclear,  

because if Iran goes nuclear are other nations in the Middle East 

going nuclear and we’re off to the races, then with a combination 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years” (12/2/08) Page 69. 

 

 

 

of nuclear weapons and possible terrorist and jihadist 

connections, it’s unbelievably dangerous, so I would say…   Bush 

I think has done a pretty good job of beginning with that, I 

might’ve done a few things more hawkish than Bush actually, in 

terms of confronting Iran but, you know, he’s got the Europeans 

together for the first time with serious sanctions through the UN 

Security Council, the united front he’s handing Obama, to put as 

much pressure as possible on Iran, if he can turn around the 

negative momentum on nuclear proliferation and on Islamic 

jihadism, we will have a much safer world, if we can turn it 

around over the next 20 years, if all of us can turn it around 

around the world—  if not we’re in a lotta trouble.   

JOHN DONVAN  

I’m gonna turn one more time and, I wanna hear the question 

before we go to the panel, I’m really looking for something that 

talks about the legacy that President-Elect Obama inherits…  

We’ve had a question from you…  Yes.

safe, and, in turn the world.  [APPLAUSE]  With that said, Mr.

threat to the world, and how is that different from the current 

policies that the Bush administration is employing.

JACOB WEISBERG 

I think Obama should focus as he’s appropriately doing on 

Afghanistan and how to turn around a deteriorating situation 

there.  I think he should figure out, how to get us out of Iraq 

without Iraq falling back into the situation it was in before the 

surge.   I think those are com—things that are compatible, I think 

they’re possible.  And, you know, much of this is so invisible to 

us that it’s very hard when we say Bush has kept us safe.  It’s 

true, we have not had another terrorist attack in the United 

States.  How much of that is the result of policy, how much is the 

result of accident.  We don’t know that much about it, it’s the dog 

that didn’t bark.  Would another President have handled it 

differently, I don’t think so.  I think that it’s—it’s impossible to 

say.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Simon Jenkins.    

SIMON JENKINS 

I imagine the reason why there’ve been no more attacks in 

America or in Britain or in most of Europe, is because of good 

policing on the ground, not because you’ve been at war in the 

Middle East.  I believe in good policing, I think the Kyoto 

terrorism, whatever that precisely may mean, people blowing

people up, is essentially front-line policing.    Good intelligence, 

good espionage, good work on the ground.  It’s not by going to 

war against other states.  But the phrase Islamo-fascism, so 

easily bandied about from this side of the Atlantic, and I may say 

from Europe, when you travel in these countries the 

relentlessness of the assumption that every Arab, every Muslim is 

a crypto-Islamo-fascist.   And the evidence you give of it, by going 

in and invading some of their countries, is the surest possible 

way to turn them into hostile—  [APPLAUSE]  I cannot emphasize 

enough—   

JOHN DONVAN 

As a follow-up to that—   

SIMON JENKINS 

—these are normal people, by and large.  They’re people quite like 

you.  They don’t think, most of them, that they have a right to 

come and invade your country, close down Guantanamo Bay, do 

all the things they think you’re doing wrong.   There is now an 

assumption on the part of both your country and my country 

under Tony Blair, that we have in some sense a right to go and 

sort out their countries, because they’re not like our countries.  

This must be one of the great fallacies of the modern age.  I hope 

Obama overcomes it.  [APPLAUSE]

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

No, I mean I myself tend…not to use the word Islamo-fascism, I 

just think it’s a little, analytically confusing, I’m not sure fascism 

is the best way to describe them but, the Islamo-fascists if you 

wanna use that term, the Takfiris, the terror— Islamic terrorists 

have killed more Muslims than anyone—than they’ve killed 

Westerners.   And if you talk to Muslims they want those people,  

to many Muslims including many in Iraq, the greatest single vic—

what country has been the greatest victim of the terrorists of al-

Qaeda?  Iraqis, Iraqi Muslims.   And they are grateful  now that 

they are going to be able to vote in 2009 in regional elections and 

in national elections and have a shot at not having a horrible 

dictator who himself murdered hundreds of thousands of people, 

who are not being dominated by ghastly Islamo-fascists if you 

wanna use the word, but I do think, I sort of agree with the 

question in that sense—   Precisely using the term Islamo-fascist 

separates, the reason you use the term is precisely to say that’s 

not all of Islam, that’s a little part of it which unfortunately has 

been ascendant, and if not resisted, will become more ascendant, 

and we need to help people resist it,  we can’t stand back and say 

hey, none of our business, Afghanistan, Taliban takes over, so 

tough on you, you know, and Saddam, tough on you guys, and I

guess in the Sudan, it’s tough, and other places it’s tough and 

the Iranian civil society gets suppressed, and I guess we just 

can’t say anything.   And we just say hey, that’s the way they 

wanna live in that part of the world, I mean that is really what 

the counsel I think of these sort of realists who want us to think 

they are going to improve America’s standing in the world and in 

fact, will correctly call down condemnation on America as has 

happened in the past.   Incidentally, one of the things that 

encouraged radicalism in the Middle East, was the sense that we 

were standing aside, and supporting dictators out of narrow self-

interest.  The single greatest harm we did to ourselves was 

stepping back in ’91,  we went in to kick Saddam out of Kuwait 

which was correct, we needed to do so for strategic reasons, and 

then we abandoned the people of Iraq, when Saddam turned on 

them, I don’t think that’s something to be proud of and I very 

much hope actually that Barack Obama does not revert to that 

kind of foreign policy.

question about why was America kept safe for seven years.  

We’re given two answers, one was luck and the other was that 

any other President would’ve handled it the same way.  Now 

luck does come into play.  But luck works when you have the 

kinda attitude that this President has which is he’s gonna stay

on the offense so we fight ‘em over there, and we’re gonna use 

every intelligence tool at our disposal, to find out what they’re 

up to.   That is why we broke some of the plots that you know 

about publicly.  You don’t know about all the plots but you 

know about the attempt to bring down Liberty Tower in Los 

Angeles, or to blow up airliners simultaneously over the Pacific 

Ocean.  We’re able to break up those plots because this 

President adopted programs—now maybe, Jacob is right that 

any other President would’ve pursued the terrorist surveillance 

program, and the widespread use of our intelligence assets 

abroad, to listen in on the enemy.  I hope he’s right.

without the central authorities knowing about it—   

JACOB WEISBERG

KARL ROVE 

—in the aftermath—pardon me, let me finish.  

JACOB WEISBERG 

Okay.    

KARL ROVE 

In the aftermath of Afghanistan and taking down the Taliban, 

where did Zarqawi go for medical treatment.  He checked himself 

into the Mayo Clinic of Baghdad.  You don’t get that unless 

somebody in the government up top allows a known terrorist to 

seek, to seek succor and medical care in Baghdad, this was a bad 

actor.   Now, did we think he had weapons of mass destruction, 

you bet, and I’ve got a sheaf-load of quotes from people that you 

love, like Ted Kennedy and others saying he did.  He didn’t.  We 

now know that.  We went in on intelligence that was flawed, but I 

would remind you of this.  Intelligence gets it wrong both ways.  

In the run-up to Iraq Muammar Qaddafi looked around and said 

you know the United States is serious about it, Britain is serious 

about this, I got problems.  If they’re willing to take out 25 million 

people and take on Iraq with 25 million people they’re willing to 

take me on.   And he coughed up his weapons programs.  And

questions and answers but you have two minutes to sum up, and 

you can respond to the point there, I just wanna thank all of you, 

and encourage you to give yourselves a round of applause for 

terrific questions.  [APPLAUSE]   So, I wanna remind you where 

we are in this Intelligence Squared US debate.  We’ve already 

polled you when you came in before the debate began to see 

where you agree on the motion.  The motion before us is, “George 

W. Bush is the worst President of the last 50 years.”   “Bush 43 is 

the worst President of the last 50 years,” before the debate, 65

percent of you agreed with the motion, 17 percent were against, 

18 percent, one in five of you roughly, were undecided, and we’re 

going to poll you again shortly but now we move on to the final 

session of the debate in which each of the panelists has two 

minutes to summarize.   I will step in at the two-minute mark 

just to tell you that your time is up, and we are going to begin the 

summary against the motion, that George W. Bush is the worst 

President of the last 50 years, Bill Kristol, the editor of The 

Weekly Standard.    

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

As someone who grew up not far from here it’s embarrassing 

frankly that 83 percent of the people who voted think either that 

Bush is the worst President in 50 years or are undecided about 

it.  Look, people don’t have to like Bush, half the country voted 

against him in 2000 and—well, virtually almost half in 2004, if 

you’re a liberal you won’t approve of his domestic policies, if you 

think that we’d be better off not having gone into Iraq which 

obviously is a debatable proposition, you could be very 

condemnatory of going into Iraq and certainly many people have 

criticized the way in which we managed that war from 2004 to 

2006.  There’s no reason not to be critical of Bush, not to 

disagree with Bush, not to prefer Obama, not to have voted for 

Gore and Kerry, most people in New York obviously, have all 

those views.   But to think that he’s the worst President in 50

years is just silly.  It’s just silly and it came out very well in the 

Vietnam discussion, I mean are we being serious here?  Vietnam 

was well-run and that was okay somehow and, you know, 

Westmoreland knew what he was doing.   Of course we lost 

55,000 people, we lost a war, 2 million people plus died in 

Vietnam and Cambodia, it was an unbelievable catastrophe, 

which the region took a long time to recover from, it was a terrible 

humiliation moral and political for the United States.   That’s like 

Iraq?  Where we’ve lost 4,000 soldiers, where Iraq is now back on 

its feet, where we’ve won the war, where we’ve won the war and 

established US credibility and a willingness to stick to it even 

though we’ve made terrible mistakes and where we’re actually in 

pretty good shape with most of the governments in the region,  I 

myself being more of a democracy and human rights activist am 

a little unhappy that we’re so friendly—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Bill, conclude—   

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

—with the governments— 

JOHN DONVAN 

—your time is up, 15 seconds grace.    

WILLIAM KRISTOL 

With the governments in the region.  But we are so if we’re in the 

real world, in the real world you can dislike George W. Bush but

you should be against this motion.

Summing up for the motion that George W. Bush is the worst 

American President in the last 50 years, Jacob Weisberg, author 

of The Bush Tragedy and editor-in-chief of the Slate Group.  

Jacob Weisberg.   

JACOB WEISBERG 

Thank you.  “We’ve won the war in Iraq,” there’s something about 

this “mission accomplished” language that always makes me a 

little nervous.  I think the damage in Iraq can be mitigated, but it 

can’t— the war can’t be vindicated as a decision.   And this goes 

to the heart of our disagreement, Bill said at the beginning that 

Bush had bad choices, I don’t think he had bad choices, I think 

he made bad choices.  And I think things could’ve been different 

for Bush.  I think he could’ve taken a different approach, and in 

fact it was the approach he took when he was governor of Texas.   

He could’ve united the country and the world after September 

11th, it would’ve given him an opportunity to be a great President, 

he could’ve reached out to the other party the way FDR did after 

Pearl Harbor.  He could’ve kept his focus on America’s real 

enemies, as opposed to becoming distracted by Saddam Hussein.   

He could’ve compromised with Democrats on a whole range of 

issues including climate change, expanding health care coverage,

entitlement reform.  He could’ve focused on protecting the free 

market instead of the interests of big business.   And I think if 

Bush had tried to govern from the center right, instead of from 

the far right, he would’ve been reelected by a bigger margin in 

2004 and he would’ve been a successful President.  But Bush 

was never up to the job of being President, and it’s not a matter 

of lacking in intelligence, it’s a matter of lacking character.   Bush 

wasn’t interested enough in policy, he couldn’t tolerate challenge 

or dissent or disagreement, he couldn’t open his mind long 

enough to consider alternatives or admit the possibility that he 

might sometimes be wrong.   He let his righteousness and his 

arrogance and his anger get the better of him.  And in the end I 

think what’s so damning about Bush and what does make him 

the worst President of the last 50 years, is that these were things 

within his control.  And to finish, I think we can say at this point 

that, American’s great nepotistic experiment is finally coming to 

an end.  It’s—  [APPLAUSE]   And as my colleague Simon Jenkins 

has said, it’s finishing not just with failure, not just with 

rejection, but in global disgrace.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Jacob Weisberg.  [APPLAUSE]  Making his summary 

statement against the motion that George W. Bush is the worst 

American President of the last 50 years, Karl Rove, former deputy 

chief of staff and senior advisor to George W. Bush.

KARL ROVE 

John, you said that with a particular glee, I mean it’s,…  

[LAUGHTER]  Look…I wanna end with, by accentuating the point 

that Bill made, but first of all I need to say Jacob’s comments can 

be read in his book, which is a piece of fiction.  To believe that 

George W. Bush didn’t tolerate strong people in his cabinet or 

dissent, or disagreements, is ridiculous.  And to suggest that he’s 

not interested in ideas is that peculiar form of Bush hatred that 

causes people to lose their rational senses about the man.  

[LAUGHTER]   And this President has been—  [APPLAUSE]  This 

President has been on the receiving end of this kinda attitude 

since the moment that he took office in an election, that many on 

the left thought made him an illegitimate President.  [APPLAUSE]   

Now, here’s a man who one of his—the first person that he met 

with from the United States Congress was the Democrat, ranking 

Democrat on the House Education and Labor Committee, George 

Miller.  Didn’t compromise with Democrats, didn’t compromise 

with Democrats on No Child Left Behind which he worked with 

Ted Kennedy and George Miller and John Boehner and Judd 

Gregg to get passed.   Didn’t cooperate and compromise with 

Democrats when we came out and endorsed wholesale large 

elements of the Joe Lieberman program for homeland security.  

Didn’t compromise with Democrats when we came out for 

immigration reform?   You know, that’s just ridiculous.  But I

wanna end, ‘cause most of the circle’s around Iraq.  Vietnam I 

agree, better prosecuted than Iraq?  We ended Vietnam in defeat, 

for which the families of 55,000 fallen heroes, had reason to ask 

themselves, whether or not that sacrifice had been made in vain.   

And we’re coming out of Iraq with Iraq becoming a functioning 

democracy in the heart of the Middle East, still fragile, but 

because of the surge, and a place today where we can see the 

moment that US troops can come home with their honor and in 

victory.   And for which the sacrifices of those who have died, will 

not have been in vain.

Karl Rove, time up, take fifteen seconds, if you need it.  

[APPLAUSE] You're good?  Karl Rove.

Summing up, finally, for the motion that “George W. Bush is the 

Worst President of the Last Fifty Years,” Simon Jenkins, 

journalist and columnist for The Guardian.  Simon Jenkins.   

SIMON JENKINS 

Well, I repeat my view at the very beginning.  I'm not here to be 

rude about an American President.  I would just point out about 

Iraq, you cannot say something’s a success when I saw last week 

two million Iraqi’s are camped outside Damascus because they 

haven't got the nerve to go home to their homeland because the

Americans are there.  [APPLAUSE]  Two thirds of all the 

Christians in Iraq have been driven out of that country under 

America’s aegis.  Fundamentalism is far more rife in southern 

Iraq than it ever was under Saddam Hussein.  Let’s just get some 

facts here.  However, let me come back to the original point, I had 

great respect for Bush when he came to power.  I liked his 

courtesy, I liked his moderation, and I liked his concept of 

humility in America’s power projection.   I think, tragically, after 

9/11 he allowed the politics of fear to get the better of him, he 

persuaded my Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to let the politics of 

fear aid his re-election campaign as well.  The politics of fear is 

the most corrosive of all forms of politics in a democracy.  Power, 

and America remains… [APPLAUSE]  …remains a hugely 

powerful country, power has an obligation of restraint.   If you're 

the most powerful country in the world, your obligation is not to 

go over the top, to charge around the world invading countries on 

the feeblest of pretexts, your obligation is to show restraint.  My 

America was always a country of huge self confidence, belief in its 

ability to resist attack of any sort, and not needing to erode its 

own freedoms and those of other people in order to achieve that  

defense of democracy.   I personally think that you’ve just elected 

a man who I have found, from when I first read his book, a truly 

remarkable figure, on whom I think it is right to place great 

expectations.  And, but, he has got to recover from a terrible

legacy in the world, outside America.  I still believe he will.  I 

think you have a terrific future ahead of you, but you have been 

through an awful eight years.  Thank you very much.   

[APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Simon Jenkins.  And may I invite a round of 

applause for our entire panel.   

[APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN  

I'm asking them to sit back down for the moment of truth.  

Gentleman, have your seats once more, because we have to 

decide the winner.  Let’s remember where we are.  We have heard 

the debates, we have heard the arguments, and we have heard 

from you when you came into this debate, that sixty-five percent 

of you were for the motion, that “George W. Bush is the Worst 

American President of the Last Fifty Years,” “Bush 43 is the 

Worst President of the Last Fifty Years.”   It is now time for you, 

seventeen percent of you were against, and eighteen percent, one 

in five, were undecided.  It is now time for you to reach for those 

keypads and register your decision at this point.  While you're 

doing that, I will…  Does anybody need more time?  Is everybody 

locked in?  OK.  Sorry?  [BACKGROUND VOICE]  Oh, I'm sorry, 

some of you weren't here in the beginning, which really is going 

to mess up the numbers, isn't it?  You press one if you are for the

motion, two if you are against the motion, and three if you remain 

undecided.  The other keys don’t matter.  If you make a mistake, 

just re-enter your number, and your last number will be recorded 

by the computer.  Everyone is clear on that?  And does anyone 

need more time?  Just shout out.  OK, so the numbers are being 

tabulated, it will take about ninety seconds.  And while we’re 

waiting for the vote I would like to remind you that our next 

debate will be here again at the Symphony Space, and it will be 

recorded once again for broadcast on BBC World News Television.  

The motion to be debated on Tuesday, January 13th, 2009, is 

this: “Major Reductions in Carbon Emissions are not Worth the 

Money.”  Panelists for the motion are Peter Huber, Bjorn 

Lomborg, and Philip Stott.  Against the motion, Daniel Kammen, 

Oliver Tickell, and Adam Werbach.  And we will see you all back 

here in January at Symphony Space.  And just in time, thank 

you, the results come.  Well, we tend to judge who is the winner 

by who moved most positions, and in that case, I’ll give you the 

numbers in a second, but the bottom line is that those against 

the motion changed more minds tonight than those for the 

motion.  [APPLAUSE]  Before the debate sixty-five percent were 

for the motion, seventeen percent against, and eighteen percent 

undecided.  After the debate, sixty-eight percent were for the 

motion, twenty-seven percent are against the motion, and five 

percent remain undecided.  Congratulations to all of our
