 John Donvan: 
And we always begin them by having Bob Rosenkranz come to the stage and talk about 
our thinking in putting this debate on at this time and what’s at stake.  So please, one of 
these moments, a round of applause for Mr. Bob Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
Hi, Bob. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Hi, John. 
 
John Donvan: 
Hi, Bob.  So, you know, we’re doing one of these strategy debates.  It’s one of those, 
probably for a lot of people in the audience and myself, it’s one of those learning 
debates where we’re going to learn from both sides.  But you, we were talking before -- 
earlier in your career, you worked for the Rand Corporation out in Santa Monica 
thinking strategy.  During the period of the Cold War -- and just what -- you know, in 
terms of helping us understand what we mean when we say “nuclear strategy.”

Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I was at Rand in the ‘60s when it was the epicenter of research and thought about 
nuclear strategy.   
 
18:47:58 
 
And, you know, it’s been 70 years since a nuclear bomb was used in war.  But in spite of 
that passage of time, it still has a great deal of relevance as a strategic construct.  And in 
Rand’s view then and, frankly, in my view now, the biggest relevance of nuclear 
weapons is really as a deterrent because countries that possess nuclear weapons can -- 
can pursue a more aggressive projection of power and a more aggressive foreign policy 
than they might be able to do otherwise. 
 
John Donvan: 
So if you look at a case like Iran, and very often Iran’s leaders are disparaged as crazy 
and nuts, but for them to want to deter, have a weapon to deter doesn’t seem entirely 
irrational. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
No.  I would argue that it’s not irrational at all.  And if you do a thought experiment, 
imagine if Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons when he went into Kuwait or prior to 
9/11.   
 
18:49:05 
 
He would probably still be in office today.  So having nuclear weapons does have a 
strategic value even if they are extraordinarily unlikely to ever be used. 
 
John Donvan: 
So do we think, then, Iran, if it gets a weapon, would be not so likely to use it? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I think the strategic issue is not so much their likelihood to use it because I suspect 
that they would be deterred by the specter of a counter attack from whomever they 
used it against.  But the more relevant thing is that having nuclear weapons would 
embolden them to pursue even more aggressively the clear policy that they have of 
being a revolutionary power in a pretty dangerous neighborhood.   
 
18:49:57 
 
I mean, they’re using Hezbollah and Hamas to project power.  They’ve, in effect, 
destabilized Iraq.  They are a revolutionary power that seeks regional dominance.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 3 - 5/27/2015 

 
John Donvan: 
In terms of their apparently moving towards making this deal, they get in return now 
the lifting of sanctions, money.  Does that have -- is that an asset that, for them, could 
have as much value as the deterrent power? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, absolutely.  And I think the point is that while they might be emboldened by 
having nuclear weapons, they would also have a much greater ability to project power 
in the region if the sanctions were lifted because their economy would be much 
stronger, they’d have much more revenues from oil.  They’d have much more 
investment in their society.  The people ruling it would probably be in a stronger 
domestic position.   
 
18:50:58 
 
So, I think that as we listen to tonight’s debate, at least I’m going to be listening not just 
about whether or not they get nuclear weapons, but whether or not they are in a 
stronger or weaker position as a result of this deal to in effect act as a regional hegemon 
and adversely to the U.S. interests. 
 
John Donvan: 
So looking at the whole range of the deal, it’s a very thorny issue.  And we have four 
great debaters to take it on for us, so let’s thank Bob Rosenkranz and bring our debaters 
out to the stage. 
 
[applause] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
-- and this again is one of those times to formally begin the evening.

Once more, if you could give a round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz [unintelligible]. 
 
[applause] 
 
Buying time, that is what President Obama’s deal with Iran on nuclear weapons does in 
the first instance.  In a sense it’s getting Iran to lay aside its activities related to its

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 4 - 5/27/2015 

ambitions to build a nuclear weapon for a set number of years and then the deal ends.  
It’s kind of like having a kid put his firecrackers up on the top shelf, and you can take 
them down a few years later maybe with the hope that at that point the kid isn’t going 
to want to blow things up anymore.  And maybe the hope is that in time Iran will evolve 
in such a way that it won’t be a threat to its region.  That may be what buying time can 
deliver. Nobody loves this deal, but the White House argues that it is better than 
nothing and better than all of the alternatives.  But is it?   
 
18:52:57 
 
Well, that sounds like the makings of a debate.  So let’s have it, “Yes,” or, “No,” to this 
statement, “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America,” a debate from Intelligence 
Squared U.S.  I’m John Donvan.  We have four superbly qualified debaters, all 
firecrackers, on our stage here at the Kaufman Center in New York to argue for and 
against this motion, “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America.”  As always, our debate 
goes in three rounds, and then our live audience here in New York votes to choose the 
winner, and only one side wins.  Our motion again, “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for 
America.”  Let’s welcome the team arguing for the motion.  Please, ladies and 
gentlemen, welcome Philip Gordon. 
 
[applause] 
 
And, Philip, you are a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, but until very, 
very recently you were at the White House working on these issues.  You were a 
coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, the Gulf Region, a senior advisor to the 
president.   
 
18:53:57 
 
You have been pretty busy and pretty intimately involved with these negotiations the -- 
whose conclusions we’ll be talking about tonight.  We want to know, you know, since 
you were so close to it, is there anything that you can tell us about being inside the 
process that would shed some new light on these negotiations? 
 
Philip Gordon: 
New light, John, I can.  After many, many rounds, more than I can remember, of difficult 
contentious negotiations, I can share with you the insight that people that haven’t slept 
for five or six days at a stretch get very irritable -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- of all nationalities.

Have you slept before coming here tonight? 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Just before coming here. 
 
John Donvan: 
You just caught up?  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Philip. 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Hopefully I’m not irritable. 
 
John Donvan: 
Hope so, too.  Philip Gordon. 
 
[applause] 
 
And, Philip, can you tell us who your partner is? 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Yeah, my partner is one of America’s finest and most experienced diplomats, 
Ambassador Tom Pickering. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Pickering. 
 
[applause] 
 
Tom, you are also arguing for the motion that, “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America.” 
 
18:55:01 
 
You’re vice chairman of Hills & Company, and you have had, as Philip just said, a long 
career, five decades as a U.S. diplomat.  You were undersecretary of state for political 
affairs and ambassador to the U.N.  You were ambassador to Moscow, Israel, Nigeria.  
For a number of years, though, in the absence of any formal U.S.-Iran relations, you 
were a participant in what is called, “Track II Diplomacy.”  For those who are not familiar 
with the term, “Track II,” can you explain briefly what that is? 
 
Thomas Pickering: 
Short answer is, one more than Track I.  The long answer: it’s non-officials engaged in 
diplomacy to see if they can find a way to crack the nut.

For America.”  And we have two debaters arguing against it.  Please, let’s welcome Mike 
Doran. 
 
[applause] 
 
18:55:59 
 
Mike, welcome back your second time debating with us.  You are a senior fellow at the 
Hudson Institute, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, a former senior 
director in the National Security Council, also an insider in this process.  You helped 
devise and coordinate a lot of U.S. strategies on Middle East issues, including efforts to 
contain Iran.  You recently Tweeted this, “In --” 144 characters -- “In Obama-land, the 
kiss of the nuclear deal will turn the Iranian frog into a beautiful prince,” but don’t you 
have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince? 
 
Michael Doran: 
They’re kissing a lot of frogs.  It’s true. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
They’re kissing a lot of frogs? 
 
Michael Doran: 
Yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
And you’re against that? 
 
Michael Doran: 
I’m against that, yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  We’re going to hear why.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mike Doran.

Michael Doran: 
My partner is actually a foreigner.  He’s a Canadian.  He’s my favorite Canadian, but he’s 
also the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.   
 
18:56:57 
 
He’s Martin Dubowitz, and he’s one of the leading experts on everything financial to do 
with Iran: sanctions -- 
 
John Donvan: 
-- everything I was going to say.  So, let me just cut through the same place -- and Mark 
Dubowitz.   
 
[applause] 
  
Known to his friends as “Dubo.”  Mark Dubowitz is arguing against the motion “Obama’s 
Iran Deal is Good for America.”  And Mark, as just pointed out, you’re with the 
Foundation for Defense of Democracies.  Your think tank has been described as the 
political brain trust on Iran sanctions so much so that a few years back, a white paper 
that you co-wrote was adopted by the Obama Administration, largely without them 
changing it very much.  But they don’t seem to be listening to you now.  Are they off 
your mailing list?   
 
[laughter] 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
That is true.  That is true.  We keep sending them ideas, and the White House keeps 
saying, you know, “Iran sanctions are just so yesterday.”  
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Here tonight is your chance -- because I’m sure they’re listening -- to change their 
minds.  Ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing against the motion.   
 
18:57:57 
 
[applause] 
  
Now, this is a debate.  It’s a contest of ideas, well-presented.  And the team whose 
numbers change the most between two votes of our live audience here in New York will 
be declared our winner.  That is to say, we have you vote before the debate, and once 
again, after the debate, on these motions.  And the team whose numbers have changed

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - 5/27/2015 

the most between the two votes will be declared our winner.  So, let’s have you register 
your preliminary vote.  If you go to the keypads at your seat -- again, the motion is 
“Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America.”  If you agree with this motion, push number 
one.  If you disagree, push number two.  And if you’re undecided, push number three.  
The other keys are not live; you can ignore them.  And if you make a mistake, just 
correct yourself.  The system will lock in your last vote.  And to remind you one more 
time, we will reveal the results of this vote you’re doing now at the end of the debate, at 
the same time as our reveal of the second vote.   
 
18:58:56 
 
And the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be 
declared the winner.  
  
Okay, it looks everybody’s -- it looks like everybody’s good.  Let’s move on to Round 1.  
Round 1 are opening statements by each debater in turn.  They will be seven minutes 
each.  Our motion is “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America.”  And here to go up first 
for the motion to the lectern, Phil Gordon.  He is a Senior Fellow at the Council on 
Foreign Relations.  He was special assistant to the president and White House 
Coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, Philip Gordon.   
 
[applause] 
 
Philip Gordon: 
All right.  Thanks very much, everybody.  Thanks for coming.  I’m really pleased to be 
here and honored to be joined on my side of the debate by Tom Pickering.  Also glad to 
be up here with Mark and Mike.  They play an important role.  We disagree on this 
subject, but they play an important role in what is a really important debate.  Let me get 
straight to the point.  Tom and I are going to argue that the Iran deal of President 
Obama is good for America for three basic reasons.   
 
19:00:00 
 
One, it’s important for the United States to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  
Two, this deal effectively does that, and it does it while avoiding a costly and 
unpredictable conflict.  And three, the alternatives to this deal -- the alternatives to this 
deal are far worse.  And I’m going to ask you to pay particular attention to this third 
point, because I suspect our opponents in this debate will spend a considerable amount 
of time telling you why this agreement is imperfect and why it should also have X, Y, and 
Z.   
 
What I don’t think you’ll hear them do is present a credible and realistic alternative to it.  
And I remind you as we start, that the proposition on the table is not, “Is this a perfect 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 
  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - 5/27/2015 

deal that you would write alone if you didn’t have to negotiate it with somebody else?” 
but “Is it good for America?”  And I think if that’s the question, it clearly is.  In fact, I 
don’t even think it’s much of a close call.   
 
19:00:58 
 
The first point, I’ll be very brief on.  The United States has an interest in stopping Iran 
from getting a nuclear weapon because an Iran with a nuclear weapon could threaten 
the region and some of our close allies, including Israel.  It could be a precedent and a 
stimulant for other countries in the region to develop nuclear weapons.  And it would be 
harder to deter and contain it in terms of its foreign policy in the region.  I just want that 
to be clear.  I don’t think our opponents disagree with that, so I would just want to 
stipulate it upfront.  That doesn’t require a debate.  It is important for the United States.  
What we disagree on is whether this deal effectively does that.  And Tom and I will 
assert that it does, and let me tell you why and why it’s good for America.  The 
framework agreement that the Obama Administration negotiated cuts of all of the 
possible paths for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.   
 
Now, in this brief opening statement, this is not the place for a very detailed analysis of 
every provision in the agreement.   
 
19:01:59 
 
I suspect most of you have already read it and are familiar with it.  What I would do is 
underscore some of what this agreement does.  And I would ask you to think about it in 
these terms:  Imagine the world before us with the agreement, if we get it finalized and 
we implement it, and imagine the world without the agreement.  Think about those two 
alternatives -- alternative worlds for the future and ask yourself which one you want to 
live in, which one is good for America.   
 
I said the deal cuts off all of the possible paths to an Iranian nuclear weapon.  There are 
three basic paths:  Enriching uranium to be able to use it for a bomb, using plutonium to 
create a nuclear weapon, or a covert path.  And this agreement stops all of those tracks.  
On enrichment, what does the agreement do?  With the agreement, Iran would have to 
take its current stockpile of low enriched uranium, which is around 10,000 kilograms or 
12 tons, enough for several nuclear weapons today, as we discussed this, and get rid of 
98 percent of it, keep only 300 kilograms.   
 
19:03:05 
 
Without it, they could have whatever stockpile they like.  With this agreement, they 
would have to get rid of two-thirds of their installed centrifuges.  Today they have 
20,000 installed centrifuges.  With this agreement, it would have to go down to 6,000, of 
which only 5,000 could be operating for 10 years.  And they would all have to be the 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 
  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - 5/27/2015 

oldest technology, the least efficient.  Without it, they can operate whatever centrifuges 
they like.  With the agreement, they would have to stop all of their enrichment at an 
underground facility called Fordow and they could only keep nonoperating centrifuges 
there.  Without the agreement, they can use Fordow for whatever they like.  With the 
agreement, Iran couldn’t use its more advanced centrifuges to do enrichment for 10 
years and would have long-term limits on research and development.   
 
19:03:55 
 
Without the agreement, they can do whatever R&D they want and develop more 
advanced centrifuges very quickly.  With this agreement, Iran could not enrich uranium 
to 20 percent, the level, if you recall, when the Israeli prime minister was here in New 
York a couple of years ago, he identified as the most concerning thing.  So if you enrich 
uranium to 20 percent, it’s a short step away from 90 percent and the ability to use it 
for a bomb.  The interim agreement that we negotiated got rid of that 20 percent 
stockpile, this agreement requires Iran to not enrich at all to 20 percent, closes off all 
the potential paths to highly enriched uranium for a bomb.  It also closes off the 
plutonium path.  With the agreement, Iran has to get rid of its current heavy water 
reactor at a place called Arak and replace it with one that would not produce any 
weapons-grade plutonium at all.  And it couldn’t do any reprocessing.  It has to ship the 
core out and can’t use this site.  Without the agreement, they can finish production of 
that heavy water reactor and start producing weapons-grade plutonium.   
 
19:05:01 
 
Finally, and maybe most importantly, this blocks the covert path.  With this agreement 
in place, Iran would be bound to accept unprecedented intrusive inspections, forever, 
with a mechanism for resolving disputes.  We would have access to their entire fuel 
cycle from the mines and mills of uranium to production sites for centrifuges all the way 
to the enrichment sites themselves where there would be cameras and inspectors on a 
regular basis.  That’s what we have if we get this agreement, if we conclude this 
agreement.  Without this agreement, we don’t have any of that, and we have no idea 
what Iran is up to.  The bottom line of all that, when you put it all together, is Iran’s 
breakout timeline, the amount of time it would take them to get enough material for a 
bomb, goes from around two months, what it is today, to over a year, which our military 
specialists are confident give us enough time to react if they seek to violate it.   
 
19:05:59 
 
I could go on, but you get the bottom line point.  When you compare these two worlds 
that we could live in with the agreement or without the agreement, clearly, this 
agreement is good for the United States.  Indeed, I think it’s not even a close call.  When 
Tom takes the floor -- I’ve made the positive case for this agreement.  When Tom takes 
the floor, he’ll be able to talk about some of the reasons why not only is this a good

agreement, but all of the potential alternatives to it are much, much worse.  Thank you 
very much. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Philip Gordon. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And our motion is Obama’s Iran deal is good for America.  And here to debate against 
this motion, Mike Doran.  He is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former 
national Security Council senior director for the Near East and North Africa.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, Mike Doran. 
 
[applause] 
 
Michael Doran: 
Thank you.  Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you.  It’s fantastic to be here.  There’s 
nothing more wonderful than Central Park in the springtime except the IQ2 debate. 
 
19:07:00 
 
[laughter] 
 
Michael Doran: 
Now, as you know, we’re going to argue -- Mark and I are going to argue against.  We 
think this is a very bad deal.  Let me just get right to the point.  To me, this is like -- say 
you’re a legitimate businessman, and a Mafioso comes and you’re in a little bit of -- 
you’re in a little bit of trouble financially, and he offers you a loan, and you take it, and 
you tell yourself that this is a temporary thing and that as the Mafioso becomes your 
partner, over time, he’s going to moderate, he’s going to understand what it’s like to get 
honest profits, and he’s going to change, and he’s going to start abiding by the law.  This 
agreement would be fantastic if we were making this agreement with Denmark, but 
we’re not.  We’re making it with Iran.  We know Iran well.  We’ve known them for 35 
years.  We know what they’re like.  The Iran that we have today is the Iran that we had 
10 years ago.  It’s the Iran that we had 20 years ago.  It’s the Iran that we had 35 years 
ago.   
 
19:07:57 
 
And that’s -- that is actually the single most important question that I want to put to you 
tonight is, why do we think that this regime is going to abide by this agreement?  That’s 
the -- that is the single most important -- the single most important question, and the 
administration never, ever -- never ever talks about it.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - 5/27/2015 

 
Now, there are two stories out there that are being told.  One is the story that the 
Obama administration is telling, and the other story is the one that our allies in the 
Middle East are telling.  The story the Obama administration is telling us goes something 
like this:  Back in -- back in April of 2013, there was an election in Iran which brought to 
power this guy Rouhani, who is a reformer.  And Rouhani wanted to change relations 
with the West.  He wanted to change all of this enmity and conflict between Iran and 
the West.  And so he started this negotiation with the Americans, and he made some 
very important concessions to the Americans, concessions that they had never made, 
along the lines of the ones that Phil was talking about, basically the essence was a 
willingness to constrain their nuclear -- their nuclear program.   
 
19:09:05 
 
And that then has led to this process that we have here before us today.  That’s not the 
story that our allies are telling.  They’re saying that this process is not the result of a 
strategic change in Iran.  It’s the result of a strategic change in Washington.  The United 
States -- the United States started this process with major concessions.  It ripped up six 
Security Council resolutions that called for zero reprocessing and zero enrichment.  It 
gave Iran, in the first step, as part of the interim agreement, it gave it the right to enrich, 
and it said also that the restrictions on its program would be temporary, right?  So the 
negotiation after that -- after the initial interim agreement and the negotiations were 
over how long would that period of temporary restriction be?  And under what -- how 
big would the restrictions on the -- on the program be?   
 
19:10:01 
 
And what would Iran get in return?  Now, just for signing up to the interim agreement, 
we started paying Iran $700 million a month.  We’re paying them to negotiate with us.  
We’re going to -- when they sign the deal, we’re going to give them $50 billion right up 
front and shortly thereafter and additional $70 to $90 billion.  Now, when you ask John 
Kerry, what’s the evidence that there’s been a strategic change on the part of the 
Iranian regime?  He says, “Well, look, they signed the interim agreement, and they have 
negotiated for over a year now with us, and they have abided by the terms of the 
interim agreement during this period of negotiation.”  We paid them to do that.  We 
paid them to do that, and we have dangled out a big prize at the end of this signing 
bonus and the relief from -- and the relief from all sanctions.  So, of course, they’re 
going to be -- they’re going to play nice at the negotiating table.   
 
19:10:57 
 
What other evidence do we have other than the fact that they have allowed us to pay 
them to negotiate with us, that they have made a strategic shift?  No evidence 
whatsoever.  They still are the -- they still spout the same anti-Semitic rhetoric, they still

call for the destruction of Israel, they still destabilize their neighbors.  They still have 
four Americans who are hostage there.  They have a Marine, they have a cleric, they 
have a newspaper reporter, and they have a former FBI agent.  They didn’t even have 
the -- they didn’t have -- they didn’t even have the grace and the good manners to 
release the hostages during this -- during this negotiation.   
 
Now, Mark and I are going to divide our duties here.  Mark is going to explain to you 
why all of those characteristics of the deal that Phil went through are basically a fiction, 
why it’s a fantasy to think that any of this -- that the Iranians will abide by any of these -- 
by any of these terms that Phil mentioned.  I am just going to make a couple of 
statements about the broader problem of the deal in the region.   
 
19:12:02 
 
Mark’s going to talk about the nuclear breakout.  I’m going to talk about the regional 
breakout.  We are turning -- with this deal, we are turning Iran into the regional 
hegemon in the Middle East, all right?  We have turned a blind eye to the expansion of 
Iranian power in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen, and elsewhere across the region.  And when 
we hand them $50 billion a few months from now, if, in fact, we do, we’re going to see 
an expansion of those -- an expansion of those activities.  That’s one problem.  Another 
problem is we have set off with this deal a regional nuclear arms race.  The Saudis have 
said openly, explicitly, that they are going to match the Iranians capability for capability.  
They’re not going to wait for this deal to end before they start developing their own 
capability, and they have made that explicit.  There’s no way to deny, absolutely no way 
to deny, that there is not a regional nuclear arms race underway right now.   
 
19:13:03 
 
The other thing is this deal does not make the United States any safer.  One of the things 
that has been left off the table, not part of the negotiations, is the illegal ballistic 
missiles program of the Iranians.  So before long we’re going to have an Iran -- a nuclear 
Iran with a ballistic missile capability capable of hitting the United States.   
 
A good deal, a good deal -- and this is what we need to define -- a good deal is one that 
stops Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, A; B, makes our allies in the region feel safer 
and stabilizes the region; and, three, makes the United States safer.  This deal does not 
meet that basic criteria.  Thank you.

And a reminder of what’s going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this 
Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate.  I’m John Donvan.   
 
19:13:57 
 
We have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing for and against this motion, 
“Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America.”  You have heard the first two opening 
statements, and now on to the third.   
 
I’d like to welcome to the lectern Tom Pickering.  He is vice chairman of Hills & 
Company.  He has served as undersecretary of state for political affairs and as 
ambassador to the U.N.  and several countries, including Russia, Israel, and Jordan.  
Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Pickering. 
 
[applause] 
 
Thomas Pickering: 
Thank you, John, and thank you for your warm welcome.  It’s a pleasure to be here with 
Phil and also with Mike and Mark.  I have much I think to say tonight in a very short 
period of time, and I will do what I can to compress it.  Not too long ago when he was 
still alive, Daniel Patrick Moynihan said famously that, “You’re each entitled to your own 
opinion but not your own set of facts.”  Tonight from Mr. Doran we’ve heard an 
extremely interesting, unusual, and strange set of facts.   
 
19:15:04 
 
So let me just cover a few of those that I think will be helpful to your understanding of 
the arrangements that we have to deal with.   
 
First and foremost is the notion in his part that somehow $50 billion will pass on the 
moment of signature.  The truth is, of course, that until Iran complies with four major 
requirements of the deal -- that they put their centrifuges aside; that they change their 
stockpile from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms; that they, in fact, dismantle the 
central piece of the reactor that can make plutonium; and that they agree on that the 
past efforts that they made in a nuclear direction, in a nuclear weapons direction, are 
fully explained to and satisfactorily explained to the International Atomic Energy Agency 
-- they get nothing out of this deal. 
 
19:16:03 
 
No sanctions relief until those particular steps take place, no money passes hands to 
Iran.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - 5/27/2015 

Secondly, the notion that Iran is somehow going to enjoy, when it does get this money, 
the opportunity to play havoc in the Middle East is both strange and unusual.  Certainly 
we watch carefully what Iran does.  And none of us have undertaken the notion that the 
Iranians are angels, that the whole agreement is indeed put together with very strong 
inspection mechanisms well beyond what you have ever seen before in any country 
around the world in order to prevent the kind of cheating or indeed the kind of misuse 
of the agreement for narrow political advantage.   
 
19:16:54 
 
Were the Iranians, in fact, going to misuse this money, they would have far done it well 
before any receipts from sanctions relief, their priorities for the things that they’re doing 
in the region are high enough, I think, for them to continue to do that.  It is important, 
too, to remember this is a nuclear agreement, not a ballistic missile agreement.  Both 
sides have agreed on the importance of the nuclear agreement as a matter of priority.  
Obviously, a missile -- ballistic missile without a nuclear warhead is not the kind of 
threat that has been portrayed to you here.  And there are plenty of opportunities in the 
next set of agreements, if this one is successfully concluded, to move on to that 
particular effort.   
 
Now, let me turn, if I can, to the key questions, and they’re important to all of us here.  
You’ve already understood that both sides share a deep sense of the necessity to stop 
any Iranian nuclear weapon.  That’s stipulated and agreed.   
 
19:17:58 
 
It’s important, however, to understand that the second question -- is this a good deal for 
America -- is one that we would certainly answer in the positive for a whole set of 
reasons that Phil set out for you.  And the third question is, what are the alternatives to 
this deal?  Well, the alternatives, quite starkly and quite frankly, are two: no deal at all, 
or an attempt to use sanctions to see if, in fact, we can achieve a better deal.  You heard 
from Mr. Doran that he would like to have zero enrichment.  I would like to have zero 
enrichment, too.  I’d like to be a billionaire.   
 
[laughter] 
  
I’d like to believe in the Tooth Fairy.  But for 14 years, previous administrations 
attempted to negotiate for zero enrichment, and got nowhere.   
 
19:18:51 
 
And the value of zero enrichment, in my view, is not significant compared to the value 
of the arrangement that we now have on the table, with all of its inspection 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 
  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - 5/27/2015 

mechanisms, and with all of its limitations on Iran, and that’s extremely important to 
keep in mind.   
 
In addition to that, what would happen if we walked away from an agreement?  How 
and in what way would that affect the situation?  It would affect it very badly.  We 
would have turned down what our allies joined us in negotiating.  The notion that we 
could achieve effective additional sanctions without friends, allies, and indeed, without 
the participation of the world community, is well beyond reality.  It’s not there and it’s 
not [unintelligible].  The third question is, what would happen in the event we had no 
agreement.  Iran, of course, could move freely to a nuclear weapon.  They would have 
two to three months to breakout time.  They would, if they -- they’re so inclined, use 
that opportunity, as we have a 10-year agreement with a 15-year limitation on the 
production of more than 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to hold them in place, 
and I think that’s important. 
 
19:20:04 
 
Finally, I think it’s significant that you understand that the alternatives to an agreement 
may well involve the necessity to use force under conditions where we would be highly 
isolated, having turned down the kind of agreement we participated centrally in 
negotiating -- a good agreement.  If we were to use force, it would mean, I think, from 
the best judgment that I can get of military officials, a three to five-year cessation in the 
Iranian agreement before they could move back to where they are now.  And a situation 
under which we would have to bomb pretty continuously to keep the Iranians under 
that kind of stricture and under that kind of pressure.  To me, there is no alternative.  
This agreement is a good one.  I hope that you will consider that carefully.   
 
19:20:59 
And when the time comes to push your little button, push the button in the right order 
for the right set of arrangements that President Obama has put before you.  Thank you 
very much.

Thank you.  Great.  Well, thank you very much, John, Phil, Tom, Mike.  It’s really a 
pleasure for this Canadian, want-to-be-American, to be in such distinguished company.  
I’m very humbled to be here.  I’m going to discuss the emerging deal’s seven deadly 
flaws.  I support a good deal, but this is not a good deal.  I’m also going to suggest to you 
that this deal will make war more likely, not less likely.   
 
19:21:58 
 
And I’m going to actually take Phil up on his challenge, and I’m going to sketch out what 
a better deal looks like.   
 
The seven deadly flaws:  First of all, President Obama and his administration only about 
18 months ago committed to, quote, unquote, “Dismantle substantial portions” or “a 
lot” of Iran’s nuclear program.  This deal will leave Iran’s nuclear infrastructure virtually 
intact.  And Iran will be a turn of the screw away from developing a nuclear weapon, 
only a year’s breakout from that weapon.  And that year breakout will only last for 10 
years.  Thereafter, the breakout time will diminish significantly, and by year 15, Iran will 
have zero breakout, that’s undetectable breakout.  Number two, the administration 
gave up on long-standing U.S. policy and multiple UN Security Council resolutions, and 
they gave Iran domestic enrichment which is the key element it needs to develop a 
nuclear weapon.  Now, that was fine, except this most valuable concession wasn’t given 
up at the end of the negotiation in exchange for other valuable concessions.   
 
19:22:56 
 
No, this was given at the beginning of the negotiation, before Iran had really done 
anything significant.  And now we’re in a situation where Iran is going to have significant 
enrichment capacity.  The administration started off by offering 500 centrifuges.  Now 
Iran’s going to have 6,000 centrifuges.  That’s a 1,200 percent increase in the course of 
these negotiations.  Well, here’s a fun fact for you:  6,000 centrifuges, woefully 
inadequate if you want peaceful nuclear energy.  But it’s exactly what you need if you 
want to weaponize uranium.  Number three, we’ve heard about missiles quite 
extensively from the folks over here.  Let me just talk about an ICBM, an -- 
intercontinental ballistic missile is not for putting monkeys into space.  It is for delivering 
a warhead to New York City.  And the Iranians said that this was non-negotiable.  The 
administration said, “Fine.  We’ll take it off the table.”  Number four, the Fordow 
enrichment facility.  This is an enrichment facility that is buried under a mountain on a 
Revolutionary Guard military base.  The administration promised to dismantle it, then to 
shutter it.   
 
19:23:58 
 
And now it’s going to be left open for 15 years to develop medical isotopes.  It’ll be the 
most heavily fortified, heavily guarded medical isotope facility in the Milky Way.

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - 5/27/2015 

 
[laughter] 
 
And the problem is, in 15 years’ time, the Iranians can reconvert it to do advanced 
centrifuge powered enrichment in a heavily guarded, underground bunker underneath a 
mountain.  Number five, and this is the serious issue with this deal.  It’s the poison pill.  
Many of the restrictions on this deal are going to start sunsetting, in other words, 
disappearing, after year 10.  And by year 15, most of these restrictions are going to go 
away.  Iran is going to have an industrial sized military program, with unlimited 
centrifuge capacity, zero breakout, multiple heavy water reactors, and the ability to 
actually develop a program that is widely dispersed and very, very difficult to verify.  
This deal would have converted this Iranian regime, this regime, from a nuclear pariah 
into a nuclear partner.   
 
19:24:56 
 
Let me talk about verification and inspection because I believe our opponents are going 
to bet their debate and bet the security of the United States of America on verification 
and inspection.  This is the idea that we will have unprecedented inspections.  Well, the 
problem with unprecedented inspections is that Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader, 
just last week said, “You are not getting into my military bases, into my Revolutionary 
Guard bases.”  [unintelligible] Revolutionary Guard commander said anybody who tries 
is going to be met with hot lead.  I looked up “hot lead” in the dictionary.  It means a 
bullet.  Now, that’s a serious problem because this is a bet on verification and detection.  
And let’s talk about the U.S. track record in detecting and stopping countries from going 
nuclear.  We missed the Soviet Union, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea.  We 
underestimated Saddam’s program in 1990.  Then we overestimated his program in 
2003 and went to war to stop a nonexistent WMD program.  We have a lousy record of 
detecting when countries go nuclear.   
 
19:26:00 
 
And this is going to be a massive program on a territory more than twice the size of 
Texas.  That is what the IAEA will have to verify, particularly when this is an industrial 
sized program.  Number seven, and finally, the IAEA doesn’t enforce.  They verify, they 
monitor.  The United States of America enforces.  Now the only way we’re going to 
enforce this deal peacefully is through economic coercion, what is known as snapback 
sanctions.  Here’s the problem with snapback sanctions.  They don’t snap back very well.  
Iran will have a powerful economy in 10 to 15 years.  They’re going to get hundreds of 
billions of dollars of sanctions relief.  They’re going to be increasingly immunized against 
future economic pressure.  We’re going to end up in snapback disputes with the 
Russians and the Chinese at the Security Council.  In fact, we’re going to end up in 
snapback disputes with the Europeans when we try snapback sanctions against our

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - 5/27/2015 

French and British and German friends.  We will hit a wall of intransigence at the 
Security Council, and we will hit a wall of human greed in the marketplace.   
 
19:26:57 
 
And the problem is as we give up our peaceful enforcement mechanism in order to 
enforce the deal, this is going to make war more likely, not less likely.  Iran will be able 
to creep out, or inch out, or sneak out, or they’ll wait patiently until many of these 
restrictions disappear.  And if we are lucky enough to detect an Iranian sneak-out or 
breakout, war will be our only option.  And when that war comes, Iran will be much 
stronger, and the consequences will be much worse.   
 
Now, what about a better deal?  Well, let me spell out a better deal in seven quick 
points.  Number one, no sunset provision based on arbitrary time period.  Iran should 
have to be certified by the IAEA as having a peaceful nuclear program without any 
clandestine nuclear facilities.  Number two, no long range ballistic missiles capable of 
carrying a warhead.  Number three, shut down the Fordow facility.  There’s only one 
purpose, and that is for weaponization.  Number four, go anywhere, go any time, snap 
inspections into any Revolutionary Guard base.   
 
19:27:57 
 
Number five, Iran has been stonewalling the international community on its possible 
military dimensions of its program.  Iran should come clean before the deal, not after a 
deal, and certainly before we give them hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions 
relief.  And number six, economic leverage.  It should not be dependent on sanctions.  
President Obama said no deal is better than a bad deal.  That is not this emerging deal.  
Let’s take time to negotiate a better deal.  Why are we rushing towards a bad deal?  My 
bet, compared to Obama’s deal, Hillary’s deal will be much better.  In fact, compared to 
Obama’s deal, the leading Republican contenders will have a better deal.  Hillary and the 
Republican contenders are the ultimate snapback.  That’s why you should vote against 
the proposition that Obama’s deal is good for America.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mark Dubowitz.  And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared 
U.S. debate where our motion is “Obama’s Iran deal is good for America.”  All right.  
Remember how you voted before the debate.  Again, we’re going to have you vote right 
afterwards.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - 5/27/2015 

And I’ll say this one more time.  The team -- well, I’ll probably say it many more times.  
The team whose numbers change the most between the two votes is how we declare 
our winner.   
 
Now we move on to round two.  Round two is where the debaters address one another 
directly and take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in New York.  
Our motion is this:  Obama’s Iran deal is good for America.  We have heard Philip 
Gordon and Thomas Pickering arguing for the motion by saying that this deal is not 
perfect, but that it will contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions, that it cuts off all paths to its 
ability to construct a bomb in a short period of time.  They would not be able, they say, 
to sneak one through the system.  They say not having an agreement in place in the 
near future leaves Iran with a freehand to do whatever it wants, that it would be a 
staggered deal, that Iran doesn’t get everything up at once, but it’s through stages of 
give and take and that a deal that -- that gives the U.S. everything that it wants, to aspire 
to that is like wanting to believe in the Tooth Fairy.   
 
19:30:00 
 
The team arguing against the motion, Michael Doran and Mark Dubowitz, argue that 
there’s just no reason to think that the leadership in Iran is going to abide by the terms 
of any deal and that it’s going to change soon; that the United States gave away way too 
much, way too early in the negotiations, that there is only a future in both ends of this 
deal in which Iran just becomes a bigger power in the region and more of a 
troublemaker.  They have issues with the temporariness of this deal, the fact that 10 to 
15 to 20 years from now we would be back where we started.  And they point out that 
basically this deal leaves Iran’s nuclear infrastructure essentially intact and that it can be 
revived with the turn of a screw.   
 
I want to go to the team that’s arguing for the motion, “Obama’s Iran deal is good for 
America.”  And in a very broad sense, gentlemen, your opponents, they seem to be 
making an argument that at best, you’re naive, that you -- you’re not -- I don’t think 
they’re saying you’re willing to trust, because it sounds like you’re not willing to trust.   
 
19:31:08 
 
But you trust in the mechanisms of the deal and that you’re just putting way too much 
hope in bad guys who know how to cheat.  Why don’t you take that on, Philip Gordon? 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Yeah.  I will start.  But, frankly, I don’t know where to start, given what we heard about 
this agreement, speaking of Tooth Fairies.  I don’t get all of my predictions right.  I’m 
probably wrong most of the time.  But when I stood up there a few minutes ago and 
predicted that what we wouldn’t hear was an alternative path to get somewhere, 
instead we just hear a litany of the things that we would love to see if we could write it

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - 5/27/2015 

ourselves, I got that prediction right.  And, Mark, I think you misunderstood my 
challenge.  My challenge wasn’t to describe a better deal.  I can describe a better deal, 
and you did a great job of it.  I love your deal.  I’d sign it right now.  I can describe the 
salary package that Tom would have if he was a billionaire.   
 
[laughter] 
 
19:31:57 
 
What I can’t do is tell him how to get there.  And that’s what you didn’t tell us, how to 
get that better deal. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  We can get to that point, but I’d like it if you answer my questions.  And my 
question was that these guys are saying that you’re just naïve to believe that this -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Right. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- thing would stand up.  And I’m not saying that disrespectfully because I actually want 
to get to the points you’re making. 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Absolutely. 
 
John Donvan: 
But just to keep a shape to it. 
 
Philip Gordon: 
I’ll say one word on trust.  And I think Mike understood that point on trust, the Denmark 
analogy.  We don’t need this agreement because we trust Iran.  It’s precisely because 
we don’t trust them that we need a verifiable agreement with binding restrictions. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let’s go to the other side.  Mike Doran. 
 
Michael Doran: 
The agreement doesn’t have binding restrictions.  This is the -- the reason that we have 
gotten any compliance out of the Iranians thus far is because we’re paying them to do it.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - 5/27/2015 

The -- you know, Tom mentioned that the agreement is going to require the Iranians to 
come clean on all of their past program, which is an incredibly important aspect of the 
monitoring mechanism.  Unless you understand what the program was, you can’t 
monitor it.  The fact of the matter is the Iranians have stiffed the IAEA for a decade 
about this.  We have not stood firm on it.  We have not forced them to come clean on 
their past program.  And the agreement that we got from them about that is that, yes, 
they will address that question in the future.  I’m willing to bet anything -- I’m going to 
make a prediction right here, Phil.  And my prediction is that if this deal is signed, we’re 
going to give them sanctions relief before they ever come clean on their past program, 
because they have never ever come clean and they’re not going to let us into military 
sites. 
 
John Donvan: 
Tom Pickering. 
 
Thomas Pickering: 
Look, let me offer you the facts, not your imagination, not your predictions -- 
 
Michael Doran: 
Have they ever come clean to the IAEA? 
 
19:33:57 
 
Thomas Pickering:

Michael Doran: 
Have they ever come clean to the IAEA? 
 
Thomas Pickering:

Michael Doran: 
You just said that. 
 
Thomas Pickering: 
-- conclude the release of sanctions until they have come clean with the IAEA.  That’s an 
indisputable negotiating objective of the United States.  That’s what we have said we 
will agree to, nothing less.  And so that’s -- you’re sitting here making up fairy stories 
about what it is that’s going to be agreed or not agreed.  Nobody that I know of, when 
the framework came out on April 2nd, who knows anything about this agreement was 
not surprised by the degree to which Iran had come in our directions, including, I have 
to tell you, a number of very senior Iranians.  The notion that somehow we have been 
snookered or somehow that this process will not work, totally defeats the fact that 
throughout the Cold War we made a whole series of agreements with the Soviet Union.  
President Reagan said in his best Russian, “Doveryai, no proveryai,” “Trust but verify.”  
That’s the basis of this agreement. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, let me -- 
 
Thomas Pickering: 
This is nothing new here. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- Mark Dubowitz. 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
Yeah.  Tom, it’s interesting.  I mean, you know, these are stories you tell children to 
keep the nightmares away, that, “Don’t worry, the Iranians will come clean.  Don’t 
worry, the Iranians have come clean.”  But, Tom, you know better than anybody that 
the Iranians have been stonewalling the IAEA for years.  There are 12 outstanding 
questions about past and possibly continuing military dimensions of the Iranian 
program.  The head of the IAEA has made it very clear that he is deeply frustrated that 
Iran refuses to answer those 12 questions.  They’ve answered half of one, Tom.  Half of 
one is not answering the questions.  There are 11 and a half outstanding questions.  We 
also know that the administration will give sanctions relief based on Iranian nuclear 
compliance, and that includes centrifuges, it includes Fordow, it includes some of the 
nuclear elements of this. 
 
19:36:01 
 
So Iran is going to get sanctions relief before they ever have to come clean on all 12 
dimensions of the weaponization efforts --

Thomas Pickering: 
That’s in return for the joint program of action. 
 
Mark Dubowitz:

weaponization, which completely contradicts your thesis.

But that’s --

Philip Gordon: 
Well, they have gotten exceedingly modest sanctions relief, access to a small fraction of 
their money that has been frozen in foreign accounts, which you know very well the 
Iranian economy is at least $500 billion or a trillion dollars.   
 
19:37:01 
 
And getting access to 700 million of their own does not make a significant difference.  
The PMD [Possible Military Dimensions] point I think is the essential one.  We agree 
with you that they haven’t yet come clean on PMD, and that they need to.  What Tom is 
saying is that there won’t be real sanctions relief until they do.  Now, you can assert that 
that’ll never happen, but I think we need to debate -- you know, the proposition on the 
table is “Is this framework good for America?”  You can attack some alternative version 
of the framework, but the one on the table is the one in which they have to come clean 
on PMD before they get to -- 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
And so, here’s the problem. 
 
John Donvan:

reprocessing.  That’s not what I want.

What I want is an American side that will, A, behave like a great power, and B, not give 
the store away, that will use the leverage that it has to get the best kind of deal, the kind 
of deal that Mark described.  Now, what [unintelligible] --

John Donvan: 
What -- let me just -- why do you think that that hasn’t happened?  What do you -- what 
if this actually is the best deal that they can get -- 
 
Michael Doran: 
Oh, no, no, no, no -- 
 
John Donvan: 
-- given the realities? 
 
Michael Doran: 
No, no, no, no -- we -- listen.  I have it from European partners to the negotiations that 
they have been shocked by the giveaway.  The idea that we are responding, that we are 
responding to the demands of allies is simply not true.  This has been a bilaterally 
negotiated deal. 
 
John Donvan: 
Motivated by what? 
 
Michael Doran: 
-- by the desire for detente with Iran.  The president has sold the world on the notion 
that he is -- that what he’s trying to do is get a nuclear arms agreement.  What he is -- 
his strategic goal is to have detente with Iran, and he’s using the arms control 
agreement as the vehicle --

So, then, I’m just puzzled.  So, Mike is sure that the British, and the French, and the 
Germans, and the Russians, and the Chinese hate this agreement and think we’ve given 
away the store, but the foreign ministers of all those countries have endorsed it, and 
explained it, and defended it.  That’s a tricky one for me.

-- I mean, that’s easy, Phil.  And you know this.  The fact the matter of is is those 
countries don’t believe they can stop the Obama runaway train to essentially surrender.  
I mean, the French have -- 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Sure, the Russians are totally compliant -- 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
The European -- 
 
Philip Gordon: 
-- [unintelligible] runaway train.   
 
[laughter] 
  
[unintelligible] 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
The Europeans have told me -- the Europeans have told me their biggest nightmare, 
okay, is U.S. negotiators at one minute to midnight in a room with the Iranian 
negotiators.  And they believe at that point, major concessions come.  And listen, major 
concessions have come, Phil.  The fact of the matter is Iran’s economy was on its back in 
2013 as a result of sanctions.  As a result of sanctions relief that your administration -- 
that you were in -- negotiated, the economy is on its knees getting up to its feet.  We’ve 
lost economic leverage.  Iran went from a severe recession to a modest recovery.  When 
you lose peaceful economic leverage, you lose the ability to actually negotiate strong 
nuclear concessions.  And when you lose peaceful economic leverage in a post-deal 
environment, you have no way to enforce this deal.  And then you have to use military 
force to enforce this deal, which is something nobody at this table wants.

We agree on sanctions, Mark, at least that part of it.  That’s why they agreed to this deal 
that required them to do so many things that they didn’t want to do.  You’re right.  Their 
economy is on its back.  It’s because of the sanctions that we put together, together 
with our allies.  And that’s how we got this deal.

[laughter] 
 
[speaking simultaneously] 
 
Michael Doran: 
That was out of affection. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Talk -- you on your -- 
 
Michael Doran: 
Mark was nice.  Mark toned down the story a little bit.  The story that he heard was, 
“Our nightmare” -- this is from our European allies.  “Our nightmare is that Zarif and 
Kerry are in a hotel room, and it’s one minute to midnight, and there’s a -- then there’s a 
deadline.” That’s what they said.  Now, the story that the Obama Administration told 
when it signed the interim agreement, is it said, “Oh, the Supreme Leader is under such 
economic pressure, he’s dying for an agreement.   
 
19:42:03 
 
What he needs from us is a face-saving agreement.  A face-saving agreement.  So, we’re 
going to rip up these Security Council resolutions, zero enrichment, zero reprocessing, 
and we are going to -- we are going to give him a face-saving nuclear enrichment 
program of 1,000 centrifuges.”  And then I heard from our European allies, a little bit 
later the Americans came and said, “It’s not going to be 1,000, it’s going to be 3,000.”  A 
little bit later they came and said, “No, 4,500.”  Now it’s 6,104.  And that’s why I can sit 
here and I can tell you, with absolute certainty, and I will be correct on this, there has 
been a pattern of concession, unilateral concession from the United States, and in 
forcing our partners along, and in the end -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
 -- the Iranians won’t come clean, and we’ll give them sanctions relief. 
 
John Donvan: 
Going to Tom, please.

They have nothing to do with the framework.  They have nothing to do with what we 
now have in hand, and they have nothing to do with what is now being currently 
negotiated as the final language of the agreement, which I am told is moving well.  So if 
you want to believe the Tooth Fairy, if you want to believe the worst of all possible 
predictions, there’s your choice.  But it’s not up on the board.  You’re not voting for 
anything but the Obama proposal at the present time or some alternative imaginary set 
of ideas.  We constantly have asked, how is it that you would get done what it is you 
want to get done?  And why is what you want to get done so much more worthwhile in 
the process of moving ahead?  Everybody knows they negotiated for a house here in 
this room.  How many in this room have negotiated for a house?  Everybody knows your 
first bid is not the acceptable answer to what it is you get.   
 
19:44:01 
 
It’s plain and simple.

The two guys over here didn’t raise their hands so -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Mark Dubowitz.  Mark Dubowitz. 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
Well, here’s the problem.  We have outlined a better deal.  And one of the key elements 
of a better deal is that the restrictions of the Obama administration of putting on this 
program are not going to expire after 15 years.  I mean, 15 years.  So let me ask how 
many of you are remember 9/11?  9/11 was 14 years ago.  How many of you have kids?  
All right, college senior was in first grade 15 years ago.  And parents know that in 
geopolitics, as in life, 15 years is a blip in time.  In 15 years, most of these restrictions are

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - 5/27/2015 

going to vanish.  Iran will have an industrial sized program.  It’ll have zero breakout.  
Zero breakout is undetectable breakout.  Tom, we can negotiate a better deal by making 
one simple modification to the Obama deal.   
 
19:44:59 
 
And that is that the restrictions will not sunset.  They will not disappear until the 
International Atomic Energy Agency has reached a broader conclusion that Iran’s 
nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and there are no clandestine activities, 
which why not demand that? 
 
John Donvan: 
Let’s take that to Phil.  I mean, I think that a lot of people in the audience would wonder 
is, what’s so great about a deal that gets Iran to stop for 20 years and then they could 
start again?  So what -- what’s supposed to happen after that? 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Well, one thing that’s great about it is Iran stops for 20 years.  So you may not -- it may 
not be your ideal scenario.  But if Iran doesn’t stop for 20 years, then they start 
tomorrow.  So that’s one thing about it.  Secondly, I keep coming back to this, and I’m 
sorry.  You need a deal that you actually get and not one that you would, like I said 
earlier, write if you only had to write it yourself.  We could have -- of course, Mark, we 
could do that.  We could go to the Iranians now and say, “You’re currently in the 
doghouse because people don’t trust you.  You violated Security Council resolutions, 
and that’s why we need these real commitments, binding commitments from you.   
 
19:46:02 
 
But you know what?  You’re going to be the doghouse forever.  You have to accept 
uniquely -- you’re the only country in the world -- you have to accept these binding -- 
not for 20 years, not for 30 years, but for infinity.”  I would submit to you we could do 
that and we would have a zero chance of getting an agreement, and then we’d be right 
back to what we’re talking about now.  And so you won’t like the 20-year restrictions.  
You won’t have any restrictions and see if you like that much better. 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
No, you’re mischaracterizing.  The IAEA could reach that broader conclusion in five 
years.  They could reach it in seven years.  All Iran has to do is declare to the IAEA that 
we have no clandestine facilities, we have no clandestine activities, and the IAEA 
reaches a broader conclusion that it has done so with 60 countries, to say this is a 
peaceful program.  So this is not about eternity.  This is not about the Tooth Fairy.  This 
is about a restriction --

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - 5/27/2015 

Oh, you were -- well, [unintelligible] so you were responding to your opponent. 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Well, one last point on sunset, about the 20 years.  This is agreement doesn’t say, and 
we don’t believe, that as soon as the restriction is over, whether it’s 10 years on 
centrifuges or 20 years on something else, Iran can do whatever it wants and get in a 
nuclear weapon.  Whenever these phases end, and in many cases, 15 and 25 years 
down the road, the U.S. president, the Israeli prime minister, the leaders of the P5+1 will 
decide how they want to approach Iran at that point.   
 
19:48:01 
 
Doesn’t mean they get a free pass.  What it does mean is we get a couple of decades of 
peace until 2030, which is a lot better than not having it next week. 
 
[bell sounds] 
 
Michael Doran: 
You get -- you don’t -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Mike Doran. 
 
Michael Doran: 
You don’t get a couple of decades.  You don’t get 10 years, you don’t get 15 years.  You 
have an agreement.  You have a Mafioso who’s going to sign an agreement, is going to 
say he’s going to abide by certain restrictions for 10 or 15 years.  But all of the leverage 
that we have, other than military force, we are giving up on the front end of the -- on 
the front end of the deal.  We’re paying them to sign this.  We are paying to say that 
they will be good citizens for 10 or 15 years.  And then you’re coming to me and saying 
that we’ve got this in hand.  This is the way -- this is the Iran that we’re going to be 
dealing with for the next 10 or 15 years is not the one that we’ve been dealing with for 
the last 35. 
 
[bell sounds] 
 
Thomas Pickering: 
Pieces of this deal last forever, including the fact that Iran is obligated not to do 
anything to move toward nuclear weapons.  Secondly, the additional inspection 
protocol stays on forever.  So those are very important because they will signal to us 
plenty early as to whether the Iranians are keeping their commitments or staying out of 
the nuclear weapons business as we go ahead.  And it’s important that we have those to 
guarantee the process is moving ahead.  And we have the force at the end of the day if 
they violate this agreement.

build my economy.  I rebuild my economy.  I create economic immunity against future 
economic pressure.  I am a good boy for the first few years, and then I start to cheat.  
But I cheat incrementally, not egregiously, even the sum total of my incremental 
cheating will always be egregious if I’m an Iranian regime.  And I will then wait until 
those restrictions start to disappear, year 10, year 13, year 15, year 20.

No, no, no.  I have a lot of respect for him but not at all. 
 
Male Speaker: 
He’s our plant.  
 
 Kayvon Afshari: 
Well, actually, I want for the side what Iran is conceding in this deal and focus on the 
sanctions relief that it will hypothetically receive.  And I kind of want to ask two sides of 
this question, one for each side.  So for the side in favor of the deal, do you see any 
veracity in the argument that, you know, an Iran which has sanctions relief will be more 
aggressive regionally, you know, spend that money in Yemen and Syria.  And for the 
other side, do you see the argument that an Iran that has sanctions removed might, you 
know, through economic interdependence -- it’ll have kind of a moderating effect on its 
regional behavior. 
 
John Donvan: 
So is the sanction for Iran basically good for America or bad for America by being good 
or bad for Iran?  Let’s take it first to Tom Pickering.

You want to take it?

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - 5/27/2015 

 
Thomas Pickering: 
Thank you. 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Look, Iran having access to its frozen funds is not something we would welcome.  We’ve 
been very clear, the administration has been very clear that Iran is a destabilizing factor 
in the region.  It’s a state supporter of terrorism, and we don’t want to see the Iranian 
regime have more money at its disposable to pursue some of these activities.  But as 
Tom reminded the group earlier on, this is a nuclear agreement.  The reason these 
specific sanctions are in place -- the only reason we got the rest of the world to join 
these sanctions -- and, by the way, it was only when the rest of the world joined them 
that they became effective -- is that they were focused on Iran’s nuclear weapons 
program.  Now, it seems to me what our opponents are suggesting here, or those who 
don’t want to move ahead with this deal, is that we focused it on the nuclear program 
to get international support for the sanctions, we brought down the Iranian economy, 
and then in the 11th hour we say, “Oh, by the way, even though we’ve gotten what we 
want on the nuclear side, let’s keep on the sanctions because we actually now want Iran 
to stop supporting terrorism, recognize Israel, stop messing around in Yemen --” and, let 
me just be clear, I’m for all of those things.   
 
19:53:07 
 
We should be vigorously trying to pursue all of those goals, but the idea that we can just 
shift gears and say, “We’re not even doing the deal until then,” is a recipe not for getting 
both a nuclear deal and constraining Iran in the region, it’s a recipe for getting neither. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mike Doran. 
 
Michael Doran: 
This deal isn’t a deal about nuclear weapons, but it has profound implications for Iran’s 
place in the world.  It has profound implications for Iran’s ability to make mischief 
around the region.  Phil says he and the Obama administration would say as well that 
they are for doing something about the Iranian backed militias in Iraq, they’re for 
stopping Hezbollah from turning South Lebanon into an armed camp.  Hezbollah has 
100,000 missiles and rockets that can -- that could hit Israel -- what are they doing about 
it?  They’re not doing anything about it.   
 
19:53:56 
 
All of the region, everyone in the region, all of our allies are up in arms, hair on fire 
about this issue, and the answer is, “Look, it’s just a nuclear agreement.”  The only way 
this agreement makes sense, is what Kayvon asked here, is if the Obama administration 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 
  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 - 5/27/2015 

believes that if it kisses the frog it will turn into a prince, that through this economic -- 
through the economic transformation of Iran, through greater relief of sanctions and 
greater business opportunities Iran is going to miraculously transform into something 
other than what we know it to be. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, that actually was the second part of the question.  What of that proposition? 
 
Michael Doran: 
The Iranian regime has -- the Revolutionary Guard Corps has set up front companies 
that dominate the economy of Iran.  They have positioned themselves very well to 
benefit from this.  What we are doing, like I said, is making a deal with the mafia and 
assuming that it will become a legitimate businessman.  There’s no reason to believe 
that.  Maybe, maybe it could possibly happen, but it is wishful thinking.  It is definitely 
Tooth Fairy thinking. 
 
19:54:59 
 
John Donvan: 
Is it at the core -- the side arguing for the motion -- is it in any way at the core of the 
thinking on the agreement that Iran in 10 to 20 years may be nicer than it is today? 
 
Thomas Pickering: 
I think it’s clear that they will be deeply invested in being part of the international 
community from which they have been excluded.  So there is no question that at least 
one possibility is that they will behave and not move toward a nuclear weapon.  The 
other possibility is we will certainly, as I pointed out a minute ago, know if they do.  And 
we will have exactly the same retributive capabilities then as we have now.  And in my 
view that is the arrangement that makes the most sense and the best deal that we have 
been able to get up until now, and our friends have shown us absolutely no way to 
improve the deal.   
 
19:55:55 
 
I would love to find ways to improve the deal, but I am totally satisfied that the deal we 
have now on the table is a deal which we can certainly live with and that we will have 
every opportunity to assure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, Tom, one second -- Tom, I just got to note that the next time you don’t need to

All right, John, thank you.  Look, Tom is actually putting his finger on their case.  Their 
case is of an economic seduction case, not economic coercion.  We’re going to seduce 
the hard men of this regime, and in 15 years they are going to be integrated in the 
global economy.  And by being integrated they’re going to be moderate and pragmatic, 
because that’s the only way this deal makes sense, because all those restrictions are 
going to go away in 15 years.   
 
Now, Tom and Phil have both said, “We will have the same coercive power in 15 years 
that we have today.”  It took decades to build up the sanctions regime.   
 
19:56:57 
It took decades to change the political calculus of the hard men of Iran to get to the 
table to start negotiating seriously.  You don’t snap back sanctions overnight.  In fact, it 
takes decades to reconstitute them.  And, as I said before, we’re snapping back 
sanctions not just against the Russians and the Chinese, we’re going to be snapping 
them back against the Europeans.  We’re going back into Iran and investing tens of 
billions of dollars back into the Iranian energy sector and the financial sector.  We will 
not have the same coercive instruments in 10 to 15 years.  We will have military force as 
an answer to Iranian cheating or challenging of the IAEA.  And if economic seduction 
doesn’t work, Phil, if economic seduction doesn’t work, Tom, it’s the same regime in 
power.  And this is not King Wilhelm Alexander of Holland.  All right?  This is Ali 
Khamenei of Iran.  And he’s a hard man.  And these are the Revolutionary Guards.  And 
they are hard men.  They cannot be economically seduced.

-- say the following, that before the November 24th preliminary agreement was even 
reached, Prime Minister Netanyahu said it was the worst of all possible agreements ever 
negotiated.  Within a year, he was back to us, pleading with us to accept this agreement 
as the “forever document” in the process of moving ahead.  He said the same thing 
about the comprehensive framework before it appeared.  Now that it is appeared, I 
hear nothing from Prime Minister Netanyahu further about the arrangement.  There is 
no other alternative in my view that is achievable, that has the capacity to stop the 
Iranians from making a nuclear weapon.   
 
19:59:04 
 
And my view is at this stage, that the allies may be jealous of the fact -- which is purely 
imaginary -- that somehow, Iran is going to emerge as some kind of new hegemon in the 
Middle East.  The president, I’m sure, made it clear to them at the Camp David summit, 
that was the farthest thing from his mind.  But it is important, in fact, that we deal with 
realities and not with the kind of imagination that sits across the table from us. 
 
John Donvan: 
Would your side like a response on that? 
 
Michael Doran: 
They’re not -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Mike Doran -- 
 
Michael Doran: 
-- the allies are not upset about imaginary things.  They allies are upset about militias 
that the Iranians are running inside Iraq, and that the United States is cooperating with 
indirectly in fighting the Islamic State.  Our airpower comes in, and knocked out the 
Islamic State of Ramadi, and the Shiite militias controlled by Tehran took it over.   
 
19:59:58 
 
In Israel, now, we have Iranian forces -- not just Hezbollah, but actually Iranian forces 
across the border from Israel in Syria.  We’ve got an Iranian proxy, Hezbollah, on Israel’s 
northern border.  We’ve got an Israeli proxy, Hamas, in Gaza.  We’ve got Iranians on the 
-- [inaudible] -- 
 
John Donvan: 
You meant Hamas as an Iranian proxy.  You --

Hamas is an Iranian proxy.

Yeah.  You referred to Israelis -- 
 
Michael Doran: 
It’s a -- it’s -- Hamas is not as closely controlled as Hezbollah is by Tehran, but the 
military wing of Hamas is armed and equipped by the Iranians.  So, the Israelis are now 
surrounded by Iranian power.  And when you -- when the Israelis or the -- and the 
Saudis see the Iranians in Yemen, when the Saudis and the Israelis go to the Americans 
and they say, “What’s your answer to this?  The rise of Iran across the region,” the -- 
what they get is rhetoric.  They get President Obama saying, “We’re concerned about 
that.  We’ve got your back.  We’ll help you.”  
 
20:00:57 
 
They say to the Saudis, “We’re going to help you with your intraoperative missile 
defense, and we’re going to give you some other capabilities against conventional 
threat, which doesn’t even address the issue at all.

Just to remind people, the proposition on the table is whether this deal is good for 
America.  Now, a lot of our allies in the region and elsewhere have real concerns about 
Iran, and so do we.  And we stand with them on that.  But a lot of our allies in the region 
would not mind if we went to war against Iran.  And we used force in Syria against Iran’s 
proxy there.  And we stood up and fought militia in Iraq.  And that may well be in their 
interest.  The proposition on the table is, is this good for America?

Yeah, and Phil, so is proliferation in the Middle East bad for America.  I mean, the Saudis 
have made it very clear that they want the deal that Iran is going to get.  So, the Saudis 
are going to have a one-year breakout capability, as are the Emiratis.  The Turks are 
going to want that.  A deal that was designed to stop proliferation is enabling 
proliferation.   
 
20:01:56 
 
A nuclear armed Middle East with nuclear threshold states to turn the screw from a 
nuclear weapon is bad for America.  That’s why Obama’s deal is bad for America.

I just would like to pose a question to both sides concerning the narrative coming out of 
both countries on this agreement.  One reads about an Iranian narrative that sounds 
substantially different, but I’m sure you are negotiating with just those people, so I just 
wondered what the -- what the explanation is for quite a discrepancy there. 
 
John Donvan: 
Phil Gordon. 
 
Philip Gordon: 
It’s actually [unintelligible] explanation because there’s not a great discrepancy.  I’d 
actually urge you to read -- the Belfer Center at Harvard did a really nice comparison of 
the U.S. fact sheet and what Iranians have been saying, because a lot of people have 
picked up on this.  You know, it’s a different agreement, and they don’t really agree to 
it.  Not surprisingly, each side is emphasizing what it gets and minimizing what it’s 
giving.  And the Iranians are really doing that.   
 
But when you actually look at what the Iranians have said, they don’t take issue with our 
fact sheet.  They’ve called it “spin,” and they’ve emphasized what they don’t have to do.  
But it’s, I dare say on their side, all spin.  Right?   
 
20:03:58 
 
So, you know, they’ll emphasize all of the things that they’ll preserve without -- they’ll 
have a 300-kilogram stockpile.  This sort of overlooked the fact that they’re going to give 
up 98 percent of what they currently have.  And they’ll have 5,000 operating 
centrifuges.  They don’t emphasize the fact that to get there they have to dismantle 
more than 5,000 others.  So if you actually look at the details of the two sides, you don’t 
find a huge gap.  You find a huge gap in emphasis, but they don’t -- they don’t deny the 
agreement that we articulated [unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mark Dubowitz. 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
Well, that’s totally right.  There’s no big gap because Iranians know exactly what they’re 
getting.  They’re getting a great deal.  They understand that they’re getting to preserve 
their entire nuclear infrastructure.  They understand that 6,000 centrifuges keep them a 
year away from breakout.

Tom, let him -- let him make his point, and then you’re going to get the floor.  All right, 
go ahead, Mark. 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
The fact of the matter is that this Iranian regime understands very well that they are 
going to get a significant nuclear infrastructure that will expand over time.  It’ll be 
industrial sized.  It’ll be massive, and they’ll have zero breakout.  Tom and Phil, you have 
not explained to us, when Iran reaches zero breakout in year 15 -- in fact, President 
Obama said, in an interview with NPR, that they’re going to reach near zero breakout by 
year 13.  You haven’t explained to the audience, and you haven’t explained to us how 
near zero breakout or breakout or undetectable breakout is a good deal for America. 
 
John Donvan: 
Do 12 seconds reminding everybody what the term “breakout” technically means. 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
“Breakout” means the length of time it takes to weaponize a bomb’s worth of uranium.  
It effectively means the most difficult element of developing a nuclear weapon and the 
element of developing a nuclear weapon that is easiest for us to detect. 
 
20:05:56

May is what we want to get to.  So [unintelligible] --

Philip Gordon: 
[unintelligible] breakout and Tom will do infrastructure.  Specifically breakout timeline is 
the amount of time that would be required to accumulate enough fissile material for 
one nuclear weapon.  And we err on the side of caution when we calculate it.  They’ve 
actually been at two months for quite a long time.  When you keep asking, we don’t 
have to deal with that.  They’re there now, today, as we sit here.  But you should 
address the virtually preserved infrastructure [unintelligible]. 
 
Thomas Pickering: 
Just -- just one point.  With too much breakout and no agreement, we have a problem.  
Secondly, this infrastructure --

problem.  Zero breakout.

 -- is certainly preserving your infrastructure.  Getting rid of 14,000 of 20,000 centrifuges 
is getting rid of your infrastructure -- it’s not getting rid of your infrastructure.  It’s 
preserving it.  Keeping the Arak reactor in a position where it can make kilograms of 
weapons grade plutonium per year, but taking it out of that particular capacity, that’s 
certainly keeping the infrastructure in place.  And we could go on.  But those three 
examples, in my view, are serious degradations of Iraq’s nuclear infrastructure.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - 5/27/2015 

John Donvan: 
Phil Gordon. 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Well, one reason is that’s partly what got us here.  You know, the world, as Iran started 
to do enrichment and move toward the potential weapons capability, go back to 2003, 
decided that the outcome had to be zero enrichment.  And we insisted on that, and we 
insisted on that as they increased from, at the time, 160 centrifuges.  And we said, “No, 
it has to be zero.”  Then they got up to 3,000, we said “It has to be zero.”  And they had 
6,000, “It has to be zero.”  And we’ve done that all the way to 19,000.   
 
20:09:59 
So we could, as you suggest, and as I think Mike and Mark would suggest, keep choking.  
While we choke -- you know, we could take that gamble.  As I said before, we could 
have showed up at the talks in the first day, said “The only outcome here is zero 
enrichment, no civilian reactors and fill Fordow with cement and let us go anywhere, 
anytime, including your military bases.”  We could have said that.  I’m just suggesting 
that had we done so, choking, choking sanctions, instead of 19,000 centrifuges, we’d get 
to 25, and then 30, and then they’d finish the heavy water reactor at Arak, and then 
they’d harden Fordow -- and then we would have another debate three years from now, 
and they’d be at 30,000 centrifuges and all the rest -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let’s -- let’s -- 
 
Philip Gordon: 
Be careful -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me -- let me frame a little bit of what you said into a question for your opponents 
because I do find it an interesting point.  They are basically saying that if you push too 
hard, if you set the terms too hard, there just wouldn’t be a deal and that they’re living 
in the real world, and they’re -- the grownup world, and the non-idealistic world, and 
that they want to come away with a deal.   
 
20:11:02 
 
So what is your response to that, that if you push too hard, there just isn’t going to be 
anything? 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
Well, the reality is is that I don’t believe that we should have imposed choking sanctions 
to these negotiations, that it’s not -- again, it’s the fallacy of the false alternative that 
Phil is very good offering.  The fact of the matter is we should increase the sanctions.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 - 5/27/2015 

We continue to ratchet up the pressure.  We didn’t have to stick at zero enrichment, but 
we could have offered exactly what President Obama offered in the beginning, which 
was 500 to 1,000 centrifuges.  Why the willingness on the part of the United States to 
continue to diminish our nuclear demands step by step?  The fact is that the Iranians 
fear U.S. escalation dominance.  They began in 2003 negotiating the Europeans over 13 
years.  They only increased their operating centrifuges by 9,500.  That’s about 700 
centrifuges a year.  They increased their program incrementally.  They fear escalation 
dominance.  They fear our crippling sanctions.   
 
20:11:56 
 
They fear our military power.  And so you’re right, we could have actually increased our 
sanctions, but we could have done so in an incremental way.  We could have ratcheted 
up the pressure.  And most importantly, we could have stuck to our nuclear demands.  
Why the rush, you ask?  The rush is because President Obama has 18 months left in his 
term.  And President Obama wants a legacy-capping nuclear deal.  I said in my 
introduction, why not let Hillary negotiate this?  Why not let Marco Rubio negotiate 
this?  Why the rush to negotiate, right?

Philip Gordon: 
Yeah, let’s just turn this all over to the Canadians.   
 
Look, an important point on number of centrifuges, because it allows me to correct the 
negotiating records, and Mark’s suggesting that we caved on number of centrifuges, and 
Mike said the same thing, to correct the negotiating record.  We’ve been very consistent 
from the very start on what outcome we needed on enrichment.   
 
20:13:00 
What we needed was a breakout timeline of a year.  The breakout timeline is not just a 
function of the number of centrifuges.  It’s a combination of the number of centrifuges, 
the type of centrifuges, and the stockpile that you have.  We told Iran, “There are a lot 
of different ways to make us comfortable that you’re at least a year away from fissile 
material for a bomb.  If you want a higher number of centrifuges, then you have to have 
a lower stockpile or you have to rely on these old out-of-date IR-1s, because what we 
care about is that you can’t quickly breakout.”  So you -- we could have gotten a lower 
number of centrifuges but maybe of a different type or a bigger stockpile.  What we got 
was extending their breakout timeline from what we’re living with today, which, as Tom 
said, is not where we would like to be, to an agreement that for at least a decade 
they’re going to be more than a year -- at least a year away.  And that’s where the 
number of centrifuges [inaudible].

He said they don’t need enrichment at Fordow, and the agreement is very clear, there 
will be no enrichment at Fordow.  There will be no fissile material at Fordow--

John Donvan: 
Our motion is, “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America,” and that concludes round two.   
 
20:14:56 
 
Now we move on to round three.  Round three will be closing statements by each 
debater in turn.  They will be two minutes each.  Remember how you voted?  
Immediately after they conclude their statements, we’ll have you vote again, and then 
we’ll have the results within about a minute and a half.  So round three, closing 
statements by each debater in turn.  The motion is, “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for 
America.”  Here to summarize his position supporting this motion, Tom Pickering, a 
former undersecretary of state and U.S. Foreign Service career ambassador. 
 
Thomas Pickering: 
I want to take you to two stories that I think are important and throw light on this 
question.  Two years ago a few of us met with then the leading Iranian negotiator.  He 
said to us frankly that “For eight years we have been in the doghouse.  Ahmadinejad put 
us there, and we’re now coming out.  We will come forward with a set of ideas and 
principles for the negotiation that will deal effectively with the problem of your 
suspicion about our nuclear weapon.   
 
20:16:03 
And we will accept inspections, a wide variety of them.  And we want sanctions relief.  
And if we cannot achieve this with you in a reasonable period of time, we won’t be 
back.”  And that’s, in fact, what has happened, interestingly enough.  And that’s where 
we are now.   
 
A second story:  Two weeks ago I had the opportunity on successive days to hear again 
from the lead negotiators on both sides.  And as Philip mentioned just a moment ago, 
each one of them said to us, “This is a good deal for the following reasons,” and the 
Iranian reasons were, guess what, quite friendly to the Iranian point of view and ignored 
the question of the major negotiating concessions they had to make.  The Americans 
were less so but, nevertheless, reflected their view.   
 
20:16:57 
 
But when I sat down just as the Belfer Center sat down, I could not find any reason to 
believe that what they had said was so inconsistent that, in fact, we didn’t have a deal 
very close to in hand, and that nothing contravened the framework.

We now have a new opportunity in the region, but we have a new opportunity first with 
Iran now, to stop any effort toward a nuclear weapon.  So, I urge you to vote “Yes” 
when the time comes, to support this arrangement.  It is, in my view, the answer to this 
difficult problem. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Tom Pickering.   
 
[applause] 
  
The motion is “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America,” and here to summarize his 
position against this motion, Mike Doran, a former National Security Council Senior 
Director for the Near East and North Africa. 
 
Michael Doran: 
Wishful thinking among highly intelligent and experienced people is a very common 
thing.  Just remember all of the very intelligent investors who put their faith in Bernie 
Madoff.   
 
20:18:01 
 
The men sitting over here are intelligent, and they are experienced, and they are 
engaging in the worst kind of wishful thinking, as is the White House.  It calls to mind 
Ronald Reagan in 1987, when he appeared before the American people and he said, 
“Three months ago I told you that I didn’t trade arms for hostages with Iran.  Today, my 
heart and my best intentions still tell me that that is true.  But the evidence has shown 
that actually something else is true.  I did trade arms for hostages.” Now, who traded 
the arms for hostages?  Who was involved in that deal?  You may recall, for those of you 
who are old enough, that Bud McFarlane, the former National Security Advisor, and 
Ollie North, of the Iran-Contra scandal, went to Iran with a plane-load of weapons.  And 
they delivered it to the Iranians.   
 
20:18:56 
 
And in return, the Iranians gave up hostages that were held by Hezbollah in Lebanon.  
What was the thinking behind it?  The thinking behind it was “We’re not trading arms 
for hostages.  What we’re doing is we’re finding the moderates in Tehran.  We’re 
making -- we’re reaching out across the political divide with them, and we’re going -- 
we’re going to create a new relationship.   
 
Now, Ollie North wakes up and bites off the heads of snakes for breakfast.  Bud 
McFarlane was a former Marine.  Ronald Reagan was a very experienced politician.  And 
he had this fantasy of finding the moderates in Iran and coming to an agreement with 
them.  And he got led down the garden path and made a fool of himself.  The exact

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 56 - 5/27/2015 

same thing is happening now to the -- to the Obama Administration.  There’s a fantasy 
in the American national security elite that across the Persian Gulf, there is this ally in 
waiting.  And if we just embrace it properly, everything is going to get better. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mike Doran, thank you very much.  Your time is up.   
 
[applause] 
  
Our motion is “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America.”  
 
20:19:59 
 
And here to summarize his position favoring the motion, supporting the motion, Phil 
Gordon.  He’s former White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and 
the Gulf region. 
 
Philip Gordon: 
So, this has been a good debate.  And we’ve had a bit of fun with it.  But the truth is, it’s 
a very serious topic.  And I have a lot of respect for a lot of the arguments that we’ve 
heard.  As you sit here and think about how you want to vote, whether you believe this 
deal is good for America or not, I would ask you to imagine not that you’re just sitting 
here and you get a free vote as a citizen, but you’re the president of the United States.  
And it’s June 30th.  And your team has come back and said, “Mr. President, Madame 
President, it’s been really hard, but we got the framework that we’ve talked out.  Well, 
we’ve got it.  Now you just have to decide if it’s good for America or not.”  
 
Now, maybe Mister, Madame President -- Mike and Mark have persuaded you it’s not 
good for America and you should reject it.  And if you do, maybe we’ll put on more 
sanctions, and somehow the world will follow us, even though we walked away from 
the agreement.   
 
20:21:00 
 
And maybe Iran will then come back to the table and agree to zero or 500 centrifuges.  
And maybe they’ll get rid of their heavy water reactor anyway.  And maybe they’ll 
accept anytime, anywhere inspections, including military bases.  And maybe they’ll 
recognize Israel and stop terrorism.  Maybe all that will happen, speaking of fantasies -- 
because you thought this deal wasn’t good and you rejected it, and you hoped all those 
things would happen, Mister, Madame President.  On the other hand, maybe we’ll walk 
away.  We won’t be able to keep the international sanctions coalition together.  Iran will 
start resuming all of those things it stopped doing with the joint plan of action, 
stockpiling 20 percent uranium, spinning 10,000, 19,000 centrifuges and more, finishing 
the heavy water reactor at Arak.  And at that point, you -- and think about this very

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 57 - 5/27/2015 

seriously -- will be faced with a choice.  Either you acquiesce and let them finish that 
heavy water reactor and build more centrifuges, or use military force to stop it, which 
would have all sorts of other consequences in the region.   
 
20:22:05 
 
That’s what I’d ask you to think about when you decide if this agreement is good for 
America or not.  I would suspect that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Phil Gordon. 
 
Philip Gordon: 
-- if we got to that point -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Phil Gordon.  Your time is up -- 
 
Philip Gordon: 
-- the deal you walked away from would look very good indeed. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Phil Gordon.   
 
[applause] 
  
Our motion is “Obama’s Iran Deal is Good for America.”  And here to summarize his 
position against the motion, Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for 
Defense of Democracies. 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
Phil and Tom, it’s been a real pleasure.  And I want to thank you both for your great 
service to our country.  I -- two years ago, I went to see someone in the White House.  
That’s when the White House would still see me.  And I met a senior White House 
director there.  And at the beginning of the meeting, he said to me, Mark, I want to be 
very clear before we start this discussion on an Iran deal, that no deal is better than a 
bad deal.  And I said to him, “I understand this.  I think President Obama just said that 
last week.”  And he said, “Absolutely.  I want to reiterate no deal is better than a bad 
deal.” 
 
20:22:57 
 
We spent about an hour and a half debating the emerging Iran deal.  And at the end of 
it, he was showing me out of his office.  We were walking down the hall, and he turned

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 58 - 5/27/2015 

to me, and he said, “Mark, I just want to be clear.  As I said at the beginning of our 
discussion, that a bad deal is better than no deal.”  Now, that’s what’s known in 
Washington as a gaffe.  A Washington gaffe is when the White House tells you the truth.  
And I think that’s where we are at today.  We are at, today -- and you’ve heard the 
argument from Phil.  You’ve heard the argument from Tom.  That really a bad deal is 
better than no deal.  But the fact of the matter is that the fallacy of false alternatives?  
There is an alternative to a bad deal.  It’s not no deal.  It’s a better deal.   
 
Our side outlined seven specific ways to make this deal better.  They are not fictions.  
They are real alternatives.  Without go anywhere, go any time inspections into military 
bases, we’ll have no way of knowing whether the regime is developing warheads. 
 
20:23:56 
 
Without the ability to actually meet the scientists that have been involved in this and 
see the documentation and get into the Parchin site that is currently being blocked and 
sanitized, we’ll have no way of creating a baseline for a proper verification and 
inspection regime.  And without effective, peaceful snapbacks, economic leverage that 
helps us actually respond to Iranian cheating and challenging.  We will only be able to 
respond using military force.  If you believe that economic seduction will change the 
hard men of this regime, then you should support their side.  If you believe that this 
terror sponsoring, holocaust-denying -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mark Dubowitz, your time is up. 
 
Mark Dubowitz: 
 -- [unintelligible] cheating regime -- 
 
John Donvan: 
We can see where you’re going.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And that concludes round three of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our 
motion is “Obama’s Iran deal is good for America.”   
 
And now it’s time to learn which side you feel has argued the best.  We’re going to ask 
you here in New York once again to go to the key pads at your seat and register your 
vote a second time.  Remember to push number one if you’re for the motion, two if 
you’re against, three if you became or remain undecided.

The motion:  “Obama’s Iran deal is good for America.”  Sir -- I just wanted to say to the 
gentleman who was all set with the mic to stand and ask a question.  I’m so sorry.  I 
wasn’t teasing.  So maybe afterwards you can come down and chat with the debaters 
and put your question to them.  You just won’t -- you just won’t be on the podcast but --

You know, that was hard and relatively technical and --

It’s a great audience. 
 
John Donvan: 
Isn’t it?  It is a great audience.

With very good questions.   
 
20:25:58 
 
But I appreciated that it was fairly technical and yet you made it accessible.  And that 
you responded to the bell.  And I appreciate that as well.

Michael Doran: 
Just not the way you wanted to [unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to thank everybody who got up and asked a question because the questions were 
all great tonight.  They really moved the debate along, so thank you for that.   
 
I want to thank -- something I’ve been saying at the end of every debate, and I want to 
say it with full sincerity.  I want to thank the people who are supporting Intelligence 
Squared.  We are a philanthropy, and we have some key supporters, but we actually rely 
on a much broader basis of supporters.  And we encourage you, if you had a good time, I 
want to let you know that the ticket price doesn’t come close, even close to what it 
costs to mount one of these.  And so we encourage you, if you’re in the spirit, to go to 
our website and make a contribution.  And our website is iq2us.org.  You can even do it 
from your seat right now.  Oh, I see everybody moving to their phones. 
 
[laughter] 
  
Think about it.   
 
20:26:58 
 
This is the last debate of our spring season here in New York, but next week we’re going 
to be on the road in Philadelphia.  It’s June 2nd.  We’ll be at Philadelphia’s National 
Constitution Center.  And what we do when we’re at the National Constitution Center, 
it’s a special series.  We look at issues but through a strictly Constitutional arguments.  
So if you happen to be there, it’s a fascinating way to hear these arguments.  We work 
with Constitutional scholars who, like these gentlemen, also bring that complex issue 
down to an understandable level.  The issue we’re going to be looking at is the 
Constitutionality of same-sex marriage and states’ requirements or lack of requirements 
to license them.  Tickets are still available through our website, iq2us.org.  Also, we’re 
going to be, this summer, in Aspen.  We’ll be partnering with the Aspen Strategy Group.  
That’s August 9th, and our debate is going to be on ISIS.  And we’ll be back here.  
September our season starts again, our fall season.   
 
20:27:58 
 
We’re putting it together, but we’ll announce the lineup this summer.  But you can 
check on our website, and you’ll get our eblast.  And the other thing is to let you know 
about our app.  It’s downloadable through the Apple store and through the Google Play 
store.  And the app has all of the debates we’ve ever done, both as a podcast and as -- 
you can watch the video.  You can look at the research that goes into the debates is 
there.  You can pose questions.  You can suggest debates.  And a bunch of debates that 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 
  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 61 - 5/27/2015 

we’ve been doing lately have come from audience members, so we take those seriously.  
So we really would love your participation on all of those levels.   
 
Okay.  So it’s all in-- and remember I asked you to vote twice, once before the debate 
and once again after the debate on this motion:  “Obama’s Iran deal is Good for 
America,” and the team whose numbers change the most between those two votes will 
be declared our winner.  Let’s look at the first vote on this motion, “Obama’s Iran deal is 
Good for America.”  Thirty-seven percent agreed at the outset.  Nineteen percent were 
against at the outset.  A large 44 percent were undecided.   
 
20:29:01 
 
So, those are the first votes.  You remember, it’s the team whose numbers move the 
most and between these two votes.   
 
So in the second vote, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 50 
percent.  That means they picked up 13 percentage points.  That is the number to beat.  
Let’s look at the team against the motion.  In the first vote, they were 19 percent.  Their 
second vote went up to 43 percent.  That’s a 24 percent increase.  That team wins.  The 
argument is defeated.  The motion is defeated by the team arguing against.  Our 
congratulations to them.  Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared 
U.S.  We’ll see you next time.
