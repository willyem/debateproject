John Donvan: 
And Intelligence Squared only exists because of the foundation, the Rosenkranz 
Foundation which is making all of this possible.  And I would like to introduce, to set the 
stage for the debate, the chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation, Mr. Robert 
Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Thank you very much.  My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate.  And 
tonight's concerns, obviously, Obama's jobs plan.  Congress should approve Obama's 
jobs plan piece by piece, since the whole thing is no longer at issue in the Senate.  The 
U.S. economy is cruelly stagnating.  Unemployment is stubbornly above nine percent.  
And we risk a serious contraction if Europe fails to deal effectively with its own debt 
crisis.

While we do need to address the federal government's fiscal position in the medium 
term, the short term need is for government to encourage jobs creation.  President 
Obama's plan does target the short term, specifically fiscal 2012, with a variety of 
measures.  These include an extension of the payroll tax holiday for employers which is 
currently in effect.  This is Economics 101.  By decreasing the cost of labor, the payroll 
tax holiday encourages business to do more hiring.  Another element of the plan is 
infrastructure spending, putting construction labor back to work for needed 
improvements to our roads, bridges, airports and the like.  The plan will create 1.9 
million jobs next year and add nearly two percent to national output.  Where is a 
counter argument?  It's that the proposal simply repeats the failed policies of the past, 
naively hoping for a different result this time.   
 
18:46:58 
 
At nearly half a trillion dollars, the plan adds around 40 percent to the already 
staggering trillion dollar deficit projected for next year.  Even accepting administration 
claims at face value, it amounts to nearly a quarter of a million dollars in deficit 
spending to put a single worker in a job for one year.  Moreover, it's arguable that the 
extra jobs will not materialize at all because the bill is rife with regulatory provisions that 
favor unions and discourage employers. 
 
Both sides of the debate will acknowledge that for the economy to grow, consumers 
must have the confidence to spend, and businesses must have the confidence to invest 
and to hire.   
 
18:47:53 
 
Will the passage of President Obama's proposals restore confidence that our 
government is capable of decisive action and is doing the right thing to jump start the 
economy?  Or will it destroy confidence by portending higher deficits, higher taxes, 
higher inflation and a bigger regulatory burden in the years ahead.  The decision is 
yours.  And we've assembled here an extraordinary panel of experts to help you decide.  
It's my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, John Donvan. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
Thank you.  And I'd just like to invite one more round of applause to Robert Rosenkranz 
for making this possible.

True or false, Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece?  That's what 
we're here to debate, another verbal joust from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John 
Donvan of ABC News. We're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York 
University.   
 
18:48:54 
 
Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece.  Two teams will argue that 
proposition from opposite sides, one for it and one against it.  And only one team will 
win.  And you, our audience here at the Skirball Center, a packed house, will decide the 
winner.  Let's meet our debaters.  Arguing for this motion that Congress should pass the 
jobs plan piece by piece, a former economic advisor to President Obama and a professor 
at Princeton University, Cecilia Rouse. 
 
[applause] 
 
Her partner is one of the nation's most prominent economic forecasters, chief 
economist of Moody's analytics, Mark Zandi. 
 
[applause] 
 
Putting the "Not" in the proposition, Congress should not pass Obama's jobs plan piece 
by piece, this team includes an influential thinker in legal academia, a professor here at 
New York University's school of law, Richard Epstein. 
 
[applause] 
 
18:49:51 
 
And his partner is a libertarian economist who focuses on tax reform and policy.  He's a 
senior fellow at the Cato Institute, Daniel Mitchell. 
 
[applause] 
 
Now, this is the debate.  One side will win, and one side will lose.  And you, our live 
audience, will pick the winners.  By the time the debate has ended, you will have been 
asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards.  And the team 
that has changed the most minds will be declared the winner.  So let's now establish the 
baseline.  We're going to go to the preliminary vote.  If you go to those key pads at your 
seat, the way that it works, there are a lot of buttons on it.  Pay attention to numbers 
one, two and three.  If you agree at this point with this motion that Congress should 
pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece, push number one.  If you are against this motion, 
push number two.

18:50:56 
 
And if you are undecided, push number three.  You can ignore the other keys.  And if 
you feel that you made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in the last vote.  
So as the end of the debate, we will reveal this number that we're registering now and 
the second number.  And by that, you will pick our winner.  Okay.  So we go in three 
rounds.  And round one, opening statements by each debater in turn.  Our motion is, 
"Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece."  And here to argue for that 
motion, Mark Zandi.  He is chief economist of Moody's Analytics where he directs 
research and consulting.  He is cofounder of economy.com and the author of the book 
"Financial Shock."  He is also interestingly enough, Mark, I notice that on the White 
House blog where they are defending this plan, they cite, when they talk about 
independent points of view, Mark Zandi. 
 
18:51:57  
 
Mark Zandi: 
Well, I must be right then. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, it would be very interesting to see you agree with yourself tonight.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, Mark Zandi. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
Thank you, John, thank you Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to be here.  And it 
is certainly an honor to be here with such a thoughtful group of individuals.  It's an 
honor to be here.  I'm going to make four points in my opening remarks.  Point number 
one is that I think there are a number of different reasons for why the Obama jobs plan 
should be passed.  I'm not going to go through all of them.  Cece's going to go through 
some of her reasoning.  But for me the key thing is we need to avoid going back into a 
recession.  And the jobs plan is instrumental in ensuring that we don't.  The economy is 
obviously struggling.  This is very obvious by looking at the job market.   
 
18:52:52 
 
If you take a look at the jobs data over the last few months, we've been getting job 
growth that's close to 75,000 per month on average.  Just for context, we need almost 
double that to maintain a stable rate of unemployment.  And unemployment is already 
9.1 percent and thus threatens to higher.  This is a rather dramatic reversal of fortune 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 -

from where we were at the start of the year. I mean, it's hard to remember back, but 
just think about January, February, March, April.  We were creating a couple hundred 
thousand jobs per month.  And I was quite optimistic about the economy's prospects.  
But we got nailed by a number of what I call unfortunate events.  In fact, John, I say 
they're unpredictable, largely because I didn't predict them. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Higher energy prices due in part to the Arab Spring and the Libyan conflict, and even 
with the declining energy prices more recently, we're going to spend about a hundred, 
125 billion more on gasoline this year than last.   
 
18:53:54 
 
And by the way, that's roughly equal to the payroll tax holiday that we got this year.  So 
we literally took our tax cut, and we put it into our gas tank.  It didn't provide the juice 
that we were hoping for, but I think it forced all the recession, very helpful.  The 
Japanese quake, very hard on manufacturing, which has been a key source of growth.  
But I think the key thing that did us in this year was a series of what I consider very 
egregious policy errors.  Most obvious being the spectacle over the debt ceiling debate.  
I think that just completely eviscerated confidence, undermined sentiment.  It's not that 
people are pulling back yet.  It's not that businesses are increasing their layoffs.  But 
they certainly have stopped hiring, and that's why we're in the predicament that we're 
in.  I do think that if policy makers do nothing, just sit on their hands and do nothing, the 
odds of recession are very serious.  In fact, I think they're better than even. 
 
18:54:52 
 
Because in current policy, under current law, there is significant fiscal restraint, meaning 
that given some of the tax cuts that expire, given some of the spending increases that 
fade away, a federal fiscal policy will cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth.  GDP is 
the value of all the things that we produce.  They'll cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP 
growth next year, and if you throw in the cuts at state and local government, it's almost 
a couple percentage points.  The good economy, a solid economy that's growing 
strongly would have trouble digesting that kind of restraint.  A weak economy, the 
economy that we're in today, I think would be pushed into recession.  So we've got to 
make some policy changes to ensure that, that fiscal drag is less significant than it is 
currently.  Point number two, I think the fiscal stimulus that has been implemented to 
date has been effective.  I think it succeeded.  The purpose of physical stimulus is not to 
provide a source of long term economic growth.   
 
18:55:56

It's about ending the recession.  In fact, the Recovery Act -- this is the stimulus that most 
people are focused on, the $850 billion package that was implemented at the start of 
the Obama administration, succeeded in ending the great recession just-- a few days.  
The Recovery Act was passed in mid-late February '09.  And by the way, in February '09 
we lost 750,000 jobs.  The economy was in freefall.  By June the economy was growing 
again, GDP, again, the value of all the things that we produce was increasing, the 
recession was over by February 2010, one year later.  We were creating jobs.  And over 
the past year and a half since February 2010, we've created well over two million jobs.  
It's not good enough but in the -- I think the counterfactual is here -- here is a much 
more serious recession.  In my view, we would've suffered a depression.   
 
18:56:54 
 
The stimulus efforts were very successful in ending the great recession, jump starting an 
economic recovery.  Third point -- did I tell you how many points I was going to make? 
 
Audience: 
Four. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Four.  The third point -- just testing, making sure you're paying attention -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- third point is that the Obama plan is pretty well structured, 450 billion over two years, 
250 billion of which approximately are temporary tax cuts, another 200 billion in 
temporary spending increases.  You know, not all of the pieces of the package are made 
equal.  In my view, the most important element of the plan is the extension of the 
payroll tax holiday for workers.  If we do not extend that, taxes for everyone will rise on 
January 1, 2012, and again, given this economy, that would be a very significant 
problem.  There are elements of the plan that are really quite creative, some of which 
Cece has worked on with respect to providing incentives for employers to go out and 
hire people.   
 
18:57:51 
 
There are reforms to the unemployment insurance system that I think has wide 
bipartisan support, and there's some really creative elements with respect to 
infrastructure spending and infrastructure banks to try to get private capital married 
with public money to go out and invest in our much depleted infrastructure, and the 
most important thing you should know, it is all paid for.  This is not a deficit of finance.  
It will be paid for by -- at this point, the discussion is to have a tax surcharge on people 
who make a million dollars a year.  Now, that's a negative.  I don't like raising taxes on 
anybody, but I think that's a modest negative in the context of, again, not going back

into recession.  And finally, point number four, this is very important, the jobs bill is only 
one part of what policymakers need to do to get this economy on the right track.  We 
also need long term economic policy, but we have -- Congress and the administrative 
have to follow through on the debt ceiling deal, and we need tax reform.   
 
18:58:53 
 
So we need to reduce the tax expenditures in the tax code, make it fairer, less complex, 
and put our businesses on solid ground.  So this is only the start of what we need to do.  
It's not the end.  I want to thank you very much for your kind attention.  We just can't go 
back into recession.  Obama's job plan will ensure that we don't.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mark Zandi. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece," and here to 
speak first against the motion, Daniel Mitchell.  He is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute 
where he focuses on tax reform and supplied side tax policy.  In his past, he was an 
economist for Senator Bob Packwood and the Senate Finance Committee.  And, Dan, 
you do these videos online that I've seen where you explain economics to the masses.  I 
want to compliment you on your delivery -- 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- as from inside the business.  It's excellent.  I was taken with your discussion of 
government spending in which you said that in the end you feel that the real reason that 
government spending happens, you say, "I suspect it's because politicians just love 
spending other people's money," but you worked for a politician? 
 
18:59:56  
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Yes, but I've reformed. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
You -- okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, Daniel Mitchell.

Daniel Mitchell: 
Thank you very much.  It’s a real honor to be here, especially with such a distinguished 
group of co-panelists.  As a matter of fact, I think what am I doing here?  I’m sort of like 
the SAT answer, one of these things is not like the other.  But hopefully, since I am 
representing the Cato Institute, I want to give people a very good impression about 
what libertarian philosophy of left government and individual freedom is all about.  And 
the way Richard and I are going to divide up our responsibility, I’m going to look at sort 
of the macro issues of stimulus and Keynesianism and Obama’s Jobs Act.  And he’s going 
to look at some of the nitty gritty details.  That of course enables me to do the easy part 
and him to do the hard part.  And I want to divide my part up, the macro part looking 
first at the theory and then at the evidence.   
 
19:00:51 
 
Now Keynesians say that whenever the economy’s weak, the government should 
borrow money, spend the money, or give tax rebates or tax relief in some form or 
fashion.  The goal of both the spending and the tax relief is to put money in people’s 
pockets so people will go out and spend the money and sort of jump start the economy.  
And that sounds very plausible.  It makes sense.  We’re all going to have money in our 
pockets.  We’re going to go out and spend money.  That has to do something good for 
the economy.  There’s only one little problem with the theory.  Where does the 
government get the money?  Government can print money. Government can borrow 
money.  Government can tax money.  But there’s no way the government can put 
money into the economy without first in some form or fashion taking money out of the 
economy.  And what is it that we’re trying to do?  What is a recession?  A recession 
means that our GDP, which used to be this much, is now this much.   
 
19:01:53 
 
This by the way is a West Virginia PowerPoint slide here.  
 
[laughter] 
 
What is it that we want to do?  What is economic growth?  Economic growth means 
we’re going to take this GDP and we want it to be higher.  But what is Keynesianism?  
What is stimulus at least as it’s defined inside Washington?  Stimulus inside Washington 
is well let’s money from the economy’s right pocket and put it in the economy’s left 
pocket.  But are we doing anything to increase this blob called GDP?  No, we’re not.  My 
contention is that what Keynesianism does is it redistributes national income, usually in 
ways that politicians find attractive because they can try to become Santa Claus and buy 
votes, but our goal should be not to redistribute national income; we want to increase 
national income.  We want a bigger pie so everyone can get a bigger slice, that’s what 
economic growth is all about.  Let me give you an example that I think makes this clear.

This is actually a quiz.  It’s not like the thing where you get to vote twice.  By the way, if 
you let them vote five times, you could rename this Chicago. 
 
[laughter] 
 
19:02:54 
 
Here’s a little quiz that will determine whether or not you’re qualified to be a member 
of Congress.  Let’s divide this room in half.  Let’s borrow all the money out of the 
pockets of the people on this side of the room and give it to the people on this side of 
the room.  Now here’s the quiz.  Raise your hand if you think there’s more money in the 
room.  
 
[laughter] 
 
I’m sorry, none of you are allowed to be in Washington because you have failed your 
elementary test on Keynesian economics.  And if you look at what’s happened.  If you 
look at the evidence for Keynesian economics, for stimulus, whatever you want to call it, 
what do we find?  I don’t think we find very good results.  You can go back to the 1930s, 
Hoover and Roosevelt were both Keynesians.  Hoover increased government spending 
by 47 percent in just four years, that was a period of deflation so it was actually more 
than 50 percent in real terms. The economy didn’t do any better.  Roosevelt in eight 
years, from 32 to 40, increased government spending by more than 100 percent.   
 
19:03:54 
 
Unemployment stayed high, the economy stayed in recession.  Now, let me give a little 
bit of humility, first, on behalf of all economists.  If you ask five economists a question, 
you’ll get nine answers . We have correctly predicted 14 of the last three recessions.  
We’re not very good at these things. 
 
[laughter] 
 
And especially when you’re looking at something like the overall macro economy.  
There’s trade policy, there’s regulatory policy, there’s labor policy, monetary policy.  
There are all of these different things going on in the economy, not to mention some of 
the exogenous factors that Mark talked about.  Earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, oil 
price shocks, you name it.  And now we’re expecting to look at one little slice of all of 
these different policy levers, fiscal policy, and we’re supposed to make sweeping 
judgments about what exactly it means.  Of course at best all we’re really doing is 
guessing.  But if you look at those periods in time when you did have politicians like 
Hoover and Roosevelt increasing government spending, it doesn’t seem to have worked.   
 
19:04:56

But it’s not just the 1930s.  Gerald Ford had a Keynesian tax rebate package in the 
1970s.  It didn't work.  Japan has had, by some accounts, 16 different stimulus packages 
since their economy entered the doldrums in the 1990s.  Those haven't worked.  Bush 
had a Keynesian stimulus package in 2008.  It didn't work. And then, of course, Obama 
more recently has done the same thing.  And time after time after time we don't seem 
to be getting very good results. Now, I'm not up here to make partisan points at all.  
What I think of policies that have not worked very well, you'll notice that I've listed 
Republican administrations and Democratic administrations.  But if you ask me what 
should happened, if you ask me for the success story, I look at things such as the Clinton 
years and the Reagan years.  And this should make Cecilia happy because she worked 
for the Clinton administration before working for the Obama administration.  She did a 
good job her first time around.  Her second time, maybe not so much.   
 
19:05:52 
 
But if you look at what happened during the Reagan years and the Clinton years, and 
you look at these broad measures of economic freedom such as the Frazier Institute, 
economic freedom of the world index or my old employers at the Heritage Foundation, 
their economic freedom of the world index, or the world economic forum's global 
competitiveness report, you will see that during the Reagan years, during the Clinton 
years, you had more economic liberalization, more freedom, a reduced burden of 
government spending.  And that's why I think we got better economic results during 
those periods.  Now, I'm running out of time, so let me go ahead and say something 
about what should happen, because obviously I'm up here trying to convince you to 
vote against the motion.  In some sense, politicians should follow the Hippocratic Oath.  
First, do no harm.  And I do worry that when politicians, especially driven by that short-
term time horizon of trying to get reelected and wanting to send out press releases, oh, 
we're doing something.  They want to show that, oh, we care.  You know, what was 
that, the first President Bush went up to New Hampshire in '92, message, "I care."   
 
19:06:55 
 
I mean, boy, talk about an empty, vacuous statement to make.  But that's how most 
politicians think.  They really are driven by this desire to try to demonstrate to voters 
that they really are concerned about your best interests, when in reality, in many cases, 
at least part of their decision making is driven by their desire to get more votes.  So I 
don't want -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel Mitchell, your time up.  Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.  Thank you.

John Donvan: 
So here's where we are.  We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence 
Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan of ABC News.  And we have four debaters, two 
teams of two arguing out this motion:  "Congress should pass Obama's job plan piece by 
piece." You've heard the first two debaters and now onto the third.  Arguing for the 
motion, I'd like to introduce Cecilia Rouse.  She's a professor of economics and public 
affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.  From 2009 to 2011, she was 
on the inside.  She served as a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisors.  
And Cecilia, I want to ask you about Thanksgiving at your house, because I understand 
you have a physicist father and a physicist brother, and you're an economist and three 
PhDs.   
 
19:07:59 
 
Maybe there's a fourth one in the family somewhere.  So what, do you talk numbers and 
formula all through -- 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Actually, there is a fourth PhD, my sister who is also a professor at Princeton, actually.  
But she's in anthropology.  So Dan Hamermesh who is a professor of economics at 
Texas, says, let me think.  Your father was a theoretical physicist.  Your brother's an 
experimental physicist. You're an economist, and your sister's an anthropologist.  You're 
getting weaker as you go. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Cecilia Rouse. 
 
[applause] 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Thank you.  It really is a pleasure to be here tonight.  And, you know, Dan really said it 
right when you said you have five economists, you really only get nine opinions.  I think 
you get many more.  I was in the Clinton administration.  Those were good years in the 
'90s.  I think many people might interpret those times, though as that the Federal 
Reserve, because we were having a lot of economic growth, and the Federal Reserve 
was not anywhere near having interest rates which were so near to zero, that monetary 
policy -- the Federal Reserve was actually responsible for a lot of that growth.   
 
19:09:01 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 -

In contrast, what we have today is, specifically, a Fed that cannot do as much as it 
normally can in normal times.  Interest rates are near zero.  It's near zero, lower bound. 
You can't have negative interest rates, and therefore it's an opportune time to have 
more fiscal policy.  But my debate partner talked about some of these bigger pictures.  
I'm a labor economist.  I got into economics because I was worried about the 
unemployed, and I still am.  There are 14 million workers in the United States who are 
unemployed.  Half of them have been unemployed for more than six months.  There are 
another two and a half million who are discouraged, meaning that they've even given up 
looking.  And there's about nine million who are working part time, but who would 
actually like to work full time.  So they're working part time for economic reasons.  
We've had 19 straight months of private sector employment growth.  But we've also 
had many months where the public sector has had negative employment growth.   
 
19:09:54 
 
And as a result, we have a recovery, but it's a recovery with a small R.  It's just fledgling.  
And as Mark pointed out I'm also very concerned that this recovery is just not far 
enough along. Now, there're huge challenges that this entire downturn is going to pose 
for us going forward. When workers become displaced, they do not earn -- they have, 
going forward, for 15, 20 years, they're going to earn much less, by some estimates, 10 
to 15, 20 percent less than they were earning before their displacement.  It has impact 
on their children.  Their children get lower levels of schooling going forward.  It is going 
to affect the earnings of their children.  And look at all of the young people today who 
are finishing their schooling and can't get a job, meaning they're not even getting 
started into the labor force.  So we know that these have the potential to really hold 
back economic growth going forward.  So yes, I support the Obama plan. I support any 
plan where it's going to provide some sort of short-term insurance against another 
double-dip recession or having more downturn.   
 
19:10:55 
 
Now look, last year, I was at the Council of Economic Advisors.  And things were looking 
a lot better.  And as a result, if you listened to the president's State of the Union, what 
he proposed in his budget were investments that were not towards stimulus, but were 
really towards the foundations of growth, in infrastructure and education, in innovation.  
And I believe that they are very important.  And we all believe that.  But we don't have 
the economy today that we had just six, nine months ago.  And therefore, I think the 
time is right for Congress to act.  Now, let's first talk about the pillars of what -- the 
major components of this plan and what it would do.  So first of all, about 40 percent of 
it is putting money in the hands of individuals.  Okay.  Some people may say, well, look, 
that's putting money in their pockets. They're not doing much.  But let's talk about it.  So 
the tax cut was providing about $1,500 a year in tax cuts for those who are earned 
about $50,000 a year, which is about what the median family earns, I should say.

19:11:52 
 
It was about $2,500 for those earning $80,000 or more.  It continues the federally 
funded unemployment insurance benefits.  Now, let's talk about that.  Six million 
workers will lose those unemployment insurance benefits.  They lost their job through 
no fault of their own.  These benefits are not helping them live high on the hog.  It's only 
replacing about half of their wages, which means they're getting a check of about $320 
a week.  And we know that that's about a third of the family income.  It helps them to 
pay their mortgage or pay their rent, helps them put food on the table.  It helps them to 
support their local businesses, et cetera.  And that's the way in which it helps to support 
the economy.  The Congressional Budget Office has said that these sorts of benefits are 
one of the fastest and most effective ways in which to help our economy in the short 
term.  Important we can talk more about this.  I know many believe that this is not the 
time to continue -- to continue these sorts of benefits.  And I would argue this is exactly 
the time to do so.  It also -- let's face it, the private sector is the most important source 
of job growth in this country.  They provide 80 percent of the jobs.   
 
19:12:52 
 
So another part of this is -- this is not about trying to create a gigantic public sector jobs 
program.  It's about trying to stand up the private sector.  So another 20 percent or so 
are ways to try to cut the cost for businesses to do their business.  So I teach 
microeconomics.  Firms do business by having labor and capital.  I hope that's as geeky 
as I get tonight.  And there are ways to cut their investments for next year and as well as 
lowering costs of hiring workers.  Again, it extends the payroll tax cut not just to the 
employee but to the employer now. And it also provides an extra incentive for firms to 
bring on more workers.  And lastly, as I mentioned before -- all of those should help in 
the next year.  But we know we're going to be in this for a little while.  It takes a while to 
recover from downturns that are caused by crises in the financial sector.  And so 20 
percent of it is also directed towards infrastructure, which again we think is actually one 
of the pillars of economic growth.  Now, as Mark mentioned, there are some 
innovations in the way some of this money would be spent.   
 
19:13:50 
 
In terms of the unemployment insurance benefit, there are some encouraging states to 
provide more employment, reemployment assistance to workers.  There is encouraging 
states to stand up programs where firms don't have to choose between laying off 
workers and keeping some-- they can share the pain, if you will, for a temporary 
downturn, through work sharing.  It encourages entrepreneurship by encouraging 
states, some of which already have them, including my own state of New Jersey -- help 
making it easier for aspiring entrepreneurs who are unemployed to be able to start their 
business while they're receiving these unemployment insurance benefits which they 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

currently are not technically allowed to do.  And it also starts an infrastructure bank 
which is a creative way of trying to bring private money into trying to foster some of 
these public projects for which normally the private sector doesn't receive enough of a 
return in order to do. So I think that it's a balanced package, and I think it hits a lot of 
the right parts.  As Mark mentioned, it's paid for.  We can talk more about the way it's 
paid for.   
 
19:14:53 
 
You know, the current idea on the table is Senator Reid proposing a 5.6 percent tax on 
those whose adjusted gross income is more than a million dollars, that's about .03 
percent of American taxpayers.  So, in closing, yes, I support a program that will provide 
support to this economy today because I am very worried about how families are 
getting by.  We have 46 million families living in poverty.  I'm worried that our recovery 
is fragile.  This doesn't mean that we don't need longer term strategies to have more 
robust growth going forward, but I just don't happen to believe that these aren't 
mutually exclusive.  Maybe hope springs eternal, but I think that Congress can walk and 
chew gum at the same time, thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Cecilia Rouse. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece," and now here 
to speak against the motion, I'd like to introduce Richard Epstein.   
 
19:15:46 
 
He's a professor of law here at New York University Law School, a senior fellow at the 
Hoover Institution, and a professor of law emeritus and senior lecturer at the University 
of Chicago where, interestingly enough, given the context, a colleague you used to 
bump into in the hallways, an adjunct professor was named Barack Obama -- 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Yes, he was -- 
 
John Donvan: 
And I understand you knew him a little bit, and you're quoted as saying that you found 
him to be an amazingly talented intellectual -- amazingly talented at playing intellectual 
poker, which, to me, sounds pretty cool. 
 
Richard Epstein: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

It's very cool.  It was very difficult to read the man, and that's why it was that he was 
such a great poker player.  But the question is not whether he could play poker, it's 
whether or not the statute that he proposes is one that will do the things that we want 
it to do.  And in this debate, there is no disagreement over the sad state of the American 
economy and the need for something to be done.  The question is how it should be 
done, what should be done, and why.  And I'm a lawyer, and I'm with three economists, 
and I have at least one comparative advantage or disadvantage as the case may be, I 
actually spent time reading the statute to see what it says in order to figure out whether 
or not the pieces make any sense.   
 
19:16:54 
 
And it's interesting that you can talk about this at the macro level, but it's also extremely 
important to talk about it at the micro level, and so let me tell you some of the pieces 
which I think are positively self destructive and ought never to see the light of day.  One 
of the truly misguided features of the stimulus program of 2009 was the passage of 
ARRA, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which instituted a whole variety of 
buy American provisions in the bill with respect to those funds which were to be 
distributed through the government to various kinds of employees.  If you look at the 
kinds of provisions that are created there, it's a massive bureaucracy which is designed 
to ensure that the money which is so distributed will be largely wasted.  It is the kind of 
thing which says that you cannot buy from sensible foreign providers if they are 
expensive and inefficient American providers, then there are huge amounts of 
administrative discretion as to when these particular requirements will be relaxed.  The 
whole thing in effect will take a large portion of the stimulus program, and it will turn it 
into a waste.   
 
19:17:55 
 
A similar provision is a re-incantation of one of the worst pieces of Hoover's legislation, 
the Davis-Bacon Act, saying that when the government gives this kind of money out, you 
have to pay prevailing i.e. union wages with respect to the money in question.  So the 
stimulus program seems to say, "The way in which you get the most for your money is 
to spend as much as you can on labor rather than as little as you can," and there's no 
way that this kind of monopoly waste can possibly improve the situation with respect to 
the legislation in question.  A third feature of the bill is to introduce a new form of an 
anti-discrimination act which says that you cannot discriminate against people who are 
unemployed when you decide whom to hire.  That of course is an extremely 
complicated provision.  It has about four separate pages to it, and there's an exception 
which says that, "Yes, you can take into account their job record under these 
circumstances."  So any employer who now wants to go out into the labor market has to 
worry about the question when they hire from other places that they may be running -- 
exposing themselves to either government liability or to private lawsuits.   
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

19:18:57 
 
But of course this does nothing to improve aggregate hiring because if you hire 
somebody who's already employed, that opens up a position for somebody else.  So 
what you have to understand is at these particular levels, all of the micromanagement is 
counterproductive to the macroeconomic goal that is in question.  Then the next thing 
that we've heard about, and was praised mightily, was the payroll reduction tax for a 
single year, and what happens is we know what's wrong with this tax because we've 
been told so by our opponents in this case.  Employers are not people who are foolish.  
They understand that if they want to hire somebody for the long run, they don't only 
look at this year's rates, they look at next year's rates as well. Our objective with respect 
to tax policy is to create some kind of a sustainable system of growth. We cannot do 
that, say, to people -- hire people this year, train them for 26 weeks, and then when you 
get to next year, what's going to happen is you're going to go back to the higher rates of 
taxation.   
 
19:19:52 
 
People will look and discount the future and therefore will not hire on the strength of 
something unless it has a time horizon equal to that of the benefits that you hope to 
achieve.  You must create lower tax rates that last for a longer period of time if this is 
going to be able to succeed. Any kind of short term fix at this particular point is doomed 
to failure.  There is no escape from that particular kind of conclusion.  So then the 
question comes, and I’ll talk about this for the remainder of my time, what is it that we 
ought to do if it turns out that we think that for both macro and microeconomic reasons 
that the Obama tax plan is doomed to failure?  And it seems to me what we have to do 
is to start from the ground up and then think about how it ties into macroeconomic 
policy.  So as a lawyer in particular, one of things that impresses me is at the same time 
we hear the grand talk about how it is we have to stimulate labor markets with respect 
to macro policies, we have an administration that has introduced very destructive policy 
at the micro level and all of these things have to be reversed.   
 
19:20:57 
 
So if you want to start with some of the difficulties in question, just take for example, as 
one particular, the decision of the administration to chase after the Boeing company 
with respect to its decision to locate a plant in Columbus -- or Charleston rather, South 
Carolina.  The net effect of this is that any time a union negotiation breaks down, an 
employer who tries to make an intelligent response by shifting states is going to be 
faced with a government prosecution.  This is not an incentive to create new plants and 
new jobs.  In effect what it is is it gives the union captive power over workers, over jobs 
in fact that a sensible employer might want to move to some other place.  When you 
start looking at the other micro things, for example, in 2005, what we decided to do was 
to raise the minimum wages.  And it seemed to be a fine thing because those were 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

optimistic days.  But if those wages happen to go down in market terms at the same 
time that the minimum wage is moved up, what’s going to happen is at the lower level 
you’re going to find that it’s very difficult for lots of unskilled people to get that first job.   
 
19:22:00 
 
And the point that was already said, namely if you don’t get the first job, you’ll not get 
the second and third job is in fact something which has been done.  
 
So this is another kind of policy that you have to be able to reverse under the 
circumstances of this case.  And the list can go on.  The government has decided that 
what it wants to do is increase the ability of unions to organize by allowing quickie 
elections to take place after it turns out that the requisite number of cards have been 
filed with the National Labor Relations Board. If you’re a small business trying to go in, 
it’s just a wonderful thing to note that after you’ve been in business for three or four 
weeks, all of a sudden you’re hit with a suit by a union which says we want to unionize, 
you’d better go out and find a lawyer otherwise capitulate to our demands. There is no 
way you can create things in a labor market under these circumstances if in fact you 
keep kicking people in the shins at the same time that you’re trying to subsidize it at the 
top.  
 
19:22:57 
 
And also there is at present, the Obama legislation which is essentially designed to 
create all sorts of medical benefits through the health care system which is going to 
predicate itself upon the employment relationship.  And these again are implicit taxes.  
So the final message that I want to leave you with is this.  The way to deal with labor 
problems is not to talk about earthquakes; it’s to talk about labor markets.  And the way 
to talk about labor markets is to liberalize it such that when people realize their chances 
to get gains from trade, they will return to the hiring market.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you Richard Epstein.  And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared 
US Debate where our motion is "Congress should pass Obama’s jobs plan piece by 
piece." Remember we had you vote before the debate to tell us where you stand on this 
motion.  We’ll have you vote again at the end of the debate asking as which side you 
feel argued best and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our 
winner.  So now on to round two where I ask questions to the debaters.   
 
19:23:56 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

They address one another.  We take questions from you.  Our motion is "Congress 
should pass Obama’s jobs plan piece by piece."  We have two teams of debaters.  We 
have Cecilia Roust and Mark Zandi who are presenting the argument in favor of this 
motion and in favor of the jobs plan, arguing that they feel that it is absolutely critical to 
avoiding another recession.  That workers who are not floating, who are sinking, are 
going to lead to no growth in the economy and if anything, a step backward, that this 
program at a minimum, at a minimum puts a stop in there.  Arguing against them, 
Richard Epstein and Daniel Mitchell who argue that this is essentially another stimulus 
plan, that historically stimulus plans do not work and that it is rife with all kinds of 
bureaucratic induction of distorted enhancements that will make it difficult for 
businessmen simply to hire people and make decisions going forward.  And therefore, if 
it were passed, it would never work.   
 
19:24:53 
 
That’s where the two sides stand on this.  And I want to start with the question to the 
side arguing for the motion and to Mark Zandi.  With your opponents arguments very 
strenuously. But essentially this is a stimulus program, and I think you agree with that, 
and you're saying that, in your argument, that this is needed to avoid a recession.  And 
you have argued that stimulus programs have already worked in this administration in 
doing good.  I wanted you to take on their argument that historically, that's not the case 
at all. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Well, I don't think that's true.  I think fiscal stimulus is a tried and true policy response to 
recession.  Since every recession since World War II, we've had fiscal stimulus.  In fact, 
the degree of fiscal stimulus provided is commensurate with the severity of the 
recession, at least as measured by the unemployment rate.  And in fact, one could argue 
that the fiscal stimulus that was provided in this recession, the great recession, was 
inadequate.   
 
19:25:56 
 
It was not proportional to the severity of the recession.  And that's one of the reasons 
why the economy hasn't engaged to the degree that I think most would have thought at 
this point. Moreover, I'm not alone in this view.  Cece brought up the Congressional 
Budget Office. The CBO is a nonpartisan group respected by both Republicans and 
Democrats.  They score the various proposals made by policy makers, tax policy and 
spending policy.  And they do studies of various stimulus packages.  And they released 
the estimates on the impact on GDP, on jobs, unemployment on a regular basis and they 
show consistently that they believe that this had been -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Mark Zandi: 
-- a plus to the economy. 
 
John Donvan: 
So you're saying it's a mainstream view.  I'd like to bring it to Richard Epstein on the 
other side. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Look, I think in effect we've seen the results already.   
 
19:26:51 
 
At the time that the Obama administration introduced its first stimulus program, there 
was a confident prediction supported by the CBO that it would lower the 
unemployment rate down to eight percent.  Nothing of the sort happened.  It stayed 
exactly dead level under the circumstances.  So the question is, why is this going to 
happen?  And essentially the CBO scores in a very static way.  It listens to what the 
administration says about the number of dollars they're going to spend and the cost for 
particular jobs, and it thinks that economics is a form of multiplication and subtraction 
and addition.  The problem is the money has to come from somewhere.  And the basic 
tradeoff that you have is this:  If in fact you decide to run this thing through a stimulus 
program, you must raise taxes.  If you raise them, as is now proposed on the most 
productive individuals in society, it turns out that you're taking money from the hands of 
people who know how to use it and to put it into the hands of a government which 
simply does not.  So the prediction is, at this particular time, what will happen is exactly 
the same thing that happened before.   
 
19:27:52 
 
There will be a short-term burst, and then magically, there will be another earthquake, 
and the program will fail. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Cecilia Rouse, I'd like you to respond.  There were a bunch of points in there, 
including don't trust the CBO, I think. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Never. 
 
John Donvan: 
Never trust the CBO. 
 
Mark Zandi: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[unintelligible] percent unemployment.  That wasn't the CBO. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Yeah, that wasn't the CBO. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Well, who did?  Did you?   
 
John Donvan: 
Cecilia.  But Richard's point about these programs remove money from people who 
make the best use of it and give it to those who don't, can you take that on? 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Well, you know, there is a theory in public finance that says that you shouldn't have a 
very high marginal tax rate on the very highest earners.  But if you actually look at the -- 
in our experience over time, there's not a great relationship between the highest 
marginal tax rates and how we're doing in terms of economic growth.  If you look at 
Reagan, he lowered tax rates for high income individuals.  Clinton increased them.  And 
you saw somewhat greater economic growth under Clinton than under Reagan.   
 
19:28:52 
 
So I think the evidence tells us that, yes, there is -- these are tax rates.  So I'm not going 
to say that there's no impact at all in terms of lowering economic growth, et cetera.  But 
it's very small for the highest earners because they don't spend the tax cuts.  And it 
doesn't have that big of an impact on their earnings.  You know, some have looked at 
what some of the highest paid CEOs did with their tax cuts.  Some of them, it's true.  
They exercised stock options creatively and strategically. But in terms of their general 
income, which is really the income-generating activity, there was really no impact.  So I 
actually think that this is -- I think it's a small tax increase today, but -- not today, it's in a 
couple of years, and that it'll be at a time when the economy can actually sustain it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel Mitchell. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Well, a couple of points.  One good thing about being a libertarian is I don't have to 
respect the CBO because CBO, like a lot of the Keynesian models, they presuppose their 
results.  It's just a mathematical formula.   
 
19:29:51 
 
If the mathematical formula is wrong, if they automatically assume that if the 
government increases spending by X, the economy goes up by Y, and they never pay 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

attention to the fact that while the economy actually went down by Z, they say, well, it 
would have gone down by more than Z if it wasn't for the government spending.  So it's 
sort of this perpetual motion machine of economics.  The White House in 2009 said if 
you pass the so-called stimulus, the unemployment rate will never rise above eight 
percent.  And instead, it's never dropped below nine percent. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me just fact check you to the other side.  Is that accurate?  Cecilia Rouse. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
That -- okay.  So that wasn't the White House.  That was a transition paper by Christina 
Romer and Jared Bernstein. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Okay.  So -- 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
But you have to remember -- 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
-- the head of the Council of Economic Advisors. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
No.  We weren't at the CEA at that point.  But here is -- 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
But the person who wound up there. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Okay.  So here is the point about that number, though, right?  There's always a counter 
factual. And as it turned out, they generated that estimate based on what they knew at 
the time which was in December 2008.  As it turned out, the economy was a lot sicker 
than what they even knew. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Well, the unemployment rate was higher when they did the forecast. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
It was.  Exactly. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
They didn't know it.  So in other words, that's -- the Krugman is that no matter how 
much Keynesianism fails, you just should have spent more money.  But that's what gets 
you eventually to becoming Greece. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
19:30:57  
 
Richard Epstein: 
There is no way to -- 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
They keep spending more money. 
 
John Donvan: 
Richard Epstein. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
There's no way to falsify that proposition because if things go better, the stimulus did it.  
If things go worse, they would have been even worse still.  So the question is, why do 
we believe when we've had a system of stagnation, when what you propose are short-
term stimulus, which by definition will drop off.  These are not going to have long-term 
benefits.  You're eating your seed corn.  Remember, tax revenues are down to an all-
time low.  Government expenditure is to a high.  You now have 40 percent of the budget 
which is being financed by deficits.  And the question is, how long is that going to be 
sustainable?  There is an optimism in your position that somehow or other we can go 
from short-term stuff to long-term stuff, and yet there's no explanation as to how that 
transition is to be made-- 
 
John Donvan: 
And, Mark, Richard is also making the point that you really can't prove your claims for 
stimulus spending having worked, because as he says, you're saying, well, it would have 
been worse if they hadn't.  So what -- 
 
19:31:51  
 
Mark Zandi: 
I can’t counter-factual.  I mean, we can't prove the counter-factual. 
 
John Donvan: 
But where does that put you in terms of your argument?  And winning that argument is 
a big thing [spelled phonetically]. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Well, I tried to make my case with respect to timing.  I mean, that's more obvious, right? 
So February '09, the stimulus, the one that we're focused on, most people are focused 
on, passed.  It was mid February '09, I believe.  In February '09, we lost literally 750,000 
jobs.  We lost 750,000 jobs in January, we lost 750,000 job in March.  The economy was 
shrinking rapidly. We were in a free fall.  By June, the recession was over, not by my 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

definition, by the National Bureau for Economic Research.  By one year later, we were 
having job growth.  So, okay, you could argue maybe the economy magically would have 
found its footing without help from the federal government.  And I'm not saying 
stimulus was the only thing.  There were many policy responses.  There was the Federal 
Reserve.  There were the TARP programs.  There were lots of different things. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
We know -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
But I think it's fair to say, just given the chronology of events, that the stimulus had a 
very positive impact.   
 
19:32:52 
 
The economy would have performed measurably worse. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
No, because at the same time, you have to -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Richard Epstein. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
-- predict that the stimulus also would fizzle.  And that's exactly what it did.  So in other 
words, there are two ways to look at this.  What you do is you give people a boost of 
adrenaline, and they start running furiously.  And then you've depleted their future 
resources, and there's nothing left to recoup.  And the question here is long-term 
sustainability.  As Cecilia said, if you're worried about labor markets, keep people out at 
the beginning, and it's going to affect them for the rest of their lives.  And so what I 
don't understand is why don't you take up the proposals to deregulate the labor 
markets to increase the expansions from gains from trade? 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Okay, can I respond? 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah.  Mark Zandi. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
I concur.  I concur.  I agree with you entirely that the stimulus efforts are not a source of 
long-term growth.  They are not.  They were never intended to be.  They were to 
provide support to the economy in a time of crisis, when we were in free fall.  But we

also need policies, like the ones you're talking about.  And we can discuss the merits of 
it, where we need to focus on regulatory policy.  We need to focus on tax policy.   
 
19:33:53 
 
And most importantly of all, we need to focus on our long-term fiscal  
 
John Donvan: 
So you're saying that jobs plan is the fire truck rushing from the fire house right now. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
That's exactly what it is.  If you had asked me to come to this debate six months ago 
when the economy was -- we were creating a couple hundred thousand jobs a month, 
I'd say, "John, I'm not coming." 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Yeah, but can I ask you -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
But I -- you know, and I'm not a hard -- Keynesian theory works at specific points in time.  
It's not an immutable fact.  It doesn't work in every environment. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, Dan -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
This is an environment where -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait, wait, Richard, let's -- Richard, let your opponent have the mic for a minute.  
Daniel, can you respond to the point that Mark just made, that sometimes at specific 
points in times it works. In your remarks earlier, you said pretty much I think that it 
never works. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Well, if you take a long-term view and not just cherry-pick an odd month here or there, 
and you go back in time, and you look at different countries where they have tried 
Keynesianism, it hasn't worked.  And one of the most interesting periods is when we 
didn't try Keynesianism.  The recession coming out of World War I was very steep.  We 
didn't do anything.  The economy recovered very rapidly.  And probably even more 
interesting is what happened after World War II.   
 
19:34:55 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 -

All the Keynesians thought we were going to have a giant recession.  They wanted to 
plan massive public work spending and things like that.  But Republicans control 
Congress.  We had gridlock, we had stalemate.  That turned out to be a wonderful thing.  
Because government didn't do anything and the economy relatively quickly digested 
millions and millions of people of being demobilized from war.  In other words, the 
Hippocratic Oath about do no harm I think really applies, not to mention the fact that at 
some point we should consider why do we get recessions in the first place which in 
many cases is because of government policy mistakes, housing subsidies, easy money 
policy by the Fed, and things like that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Right, but -- you're welcome to -- you don't have to suppress stuff. 
 
[laughter] 
 
It sounded so timid and halfhearted. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
I want the other side to respond.  You just gave us an incident in which you said there 
was a recession without stimulus, and there was a terrific comeback, and that proves -- 
that establishes that at least in that instance, if we're going to talk about specific 
situations, that it -- you can get out of it without this kind of program, and I'd like this 
side to respond to that.  
 
19:36:03  
 
Mark Zandi: 
Well, you mean -- okay.  You're going to drag me into the 1950s? 
 
John Donvan: 
A little bit. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Okay, all right, okay, fair enough.  I don't agree with that interpretation -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Well you know what, let Cecilia -- 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
No.  I actually don't want to speak to this specific point, but I -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
John Donvan: 
All right, no, no -- I want -- I just [unintelligible] to that point.  Okay. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
The 1950s were actually a pretty difficult period.  Now, I'm not arguing that stimulus 
would've been the right – that big public works project would've been the right 
response to that, but, you know, the '50s weren't the greatest decade.  It was -- 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
I'm talking about the 1940s, though. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Well, you said after the recession -- I mean, after the war, World War II ended in 1945, 
and then that period -- then we had the Korean War which was a lot of fiscal stimulus, 
and then the 1950s was a period of really no growth.  In fact, we had three recessions in 
the 1950s, and it was a very difficult time.  So I don't know, maybe.  That's stretching the 
limits of my historical experience, but -- and I know in our recent history, stimuluses 
work quite well, and in the most recent period, it's been highly successful. 
 
19:36:54  
 
John Donvan: 
Richard Epstein, what -- the president's plan also calls for putting investment into jobs 
that would rebuild highways, and bridges, and airports, and waterways, all of which, you 
know, it's clear we need, what's wrong with that? 
 
Richard Epstein: 
There's nothing wrong with doing it so long as you do it correctly and so long as you do 
it systematically, and what's happened is, of course, with the rise of the transfer society, 
there's been a systematic neglect of infrastructure.  And so clearly money has to go 
there, but if you look at this particular statute and the elaborate hoops that you have to 
go through, it is not a bill which is designed to promote infrastructure.  It is a bill which is 
designed to make sure that the president's supporters, strong union members get jobs 
which will allow them to contribute to the campaign to win.  The difference between 
this particular -- 
 
[booing] 
 
-- well, I'm glad to see that you all approve. 
 
[applause] 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

But if you look at this program as against for example, the WPA, the administrative 
overlay that you have here is very, very much higher, and if you look at the way in which 
this relates to the employment jobs, the last stimulus program that was designed to deal 
with infrastructure was capital intensive and labeled weak, so that it had absolutely 
nothing to do, whatsoever, with jobs.   
 
19:38:00 
 
So my own view about this is the infrastructure question should be handled on its own 
merits.  It should not be bundled in with the stimulus bill, and once you get that right, if 
you look at this particular bill with its new [unintelligible] and it's four for the president, 
and three for the other side, that's the last thing that you want to have running this kind 
of program. 
 
John Donvan: 
Cecilia Rouse, could you -- I know you want to get to another point and I'll come back to 
that, but can you respond to -- 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Yeah, you know, first of all -- look, I'm not a regulatory law expert, but my 
understanding is at least some of the provisions, such as the buy American provisions 
and the Davis Bacon, applied to infrastructure projects without this bill, meaning they've 
been in statute for decades since the 1930s as you mentioned -- 
 
Richard Epstein: 
And that's why we should get rid of it. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Well -- but that would mean that in order for this bill to get rid of them, that would be 
something new in this bill.  And so we could argue about the merits or not, but really all 
this bill is doing is making it consistent with current law.  
 
19:38:52  
 
Richard Epstein: 
Yes, but the -- 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
The agencies know how to administrate them, it doesn't add an additional 
administrative burden, but like I said, we could argue the merits of it, but I think that, 
that's not really the main purpose of the bill. 
 
Richard Epstein: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

When you have failed policies, you try to change them.  You're arguing for consistency, 
and I think that's fine, but if you're doing this as sort of an academic debate, the 
question is consistency, meaning getting rid of it across the board or keeping it across 
the board.  And the question is -- that Dan put to you is how do we figure out, in theory, 
which way we want to go, and here's one simple device.  If you don't know what you're 
doing, don't spend government money to do it.  And these things are highly 
problematic, completely protectionist, and so, therefore, their elimination is something 
which is a matter of first principle should want, not only here, but in all the other bills.  
Davis Bacon is a public outrage, and there's no reason why we ought to extend it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Cecilia, what was the question you wanted to bring up before? 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
The point that I was going to bring up earlier was more about how do we judge the 
value of stimulus and of the Recovery Act.   
 
19:39:51 
 
And I really just wanted to say, "Look, as Richard pointed out, the problem here is that 
we're trying to argue about a counterfactual, but I'm really sympathetic to --" 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you translate, "We are trying to argue about a counterfactual --" 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
About a counterfactual meaning.  Okay we passed the stimulus.  And the way we will 
judge whether a policy is effective, we say what would have happened had we not done 
so.  So we passed it.  I don’t yet have a time machine.  President doesn’t have a time 
machine, so we can’t go back and unpass it and see what would have happened had we 
not passed it.  Therefore what economists have to do is try to say, try to create that 
counterfactual, what would have happened in its absence.  Okay, I’m very sympathetic 
to the Keynesian multipliers, just sort of mindlessly applying the multiplier and saying 
what would happen. 
 
John Donvan: 
Which means what? 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Which means that economists have estimated okay, if we spend this much on 
infrastructure spending, then it’s going to chug through the economy and we’re going to 
get this much out and it’s going to create this much employment.  And that’s their way 
of doing a counterfactual in a sense.  I’m a micro-economist.  My job is, I do a lot in 
education, it’s to do a lot of evaluation of programs, so that doesn’t make sense to me.   



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
19:40:57 
 
But what does make sense to me, is that there’re some economists that have not taken 
that route but have said instead, well can we compare the outgrowth of, or the 
employment growth in states where they’ve got more money, or in localities where they 
got more money than in others. Now, you might worry that okay, well but why did some 
get more money than others. Maybe you got more money because you were doing 
more poorly.  They’ve tried to adjust for that in very creative and credible ways I might 
add.  And this is not by economists that were working for the Obama administration or 
really had a dog in the hunt.  And what they find is, it was actually fairly positive as well.  
So I’m fairly convinced that not just with one methodology do we find that the stimulus 
made a difference, but using a variety of them.  Will we ever know for sure?  No.  I can 
see that because I think that’s what my business --we have to be humble about that. 
 
John Donvan: 
It seems to be down on the other side, that you will never know for sure that it doesn’t 
work in the same way that they’re saying for sure that it does work. 
 
19:41:50  
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Well that’s why I made my remarks during, about economists having a little bit of 
humility because we’re trying to predict things that are fundamentally -- we’ll never 
know the right answer. We’ll be debating, we’ll all be 80 years old up here having the 
same debate.  But I do think looking at history, looking at periods where we tried 
Keynesianism versus periods when we didn’t, I think there is a pattern there that 
supports the negative proposition in this debate. Also, you look at countries around the 
world during this recent economic downturn.  It’s been fairly global.  Counties that were 
much less Keynesian in their approach, like Germany and Canada, seem to do better 
than countries that were more Keynesian in their approach like the United Kingdom and 
the United States.  But again, there are 50 different policies out there and we’re trying 
to focus on just the narrow issue of fiscal policy.  And so it really is a challenge.  And I 
think all of us up here want America to be more profitable and have more jobs.  So I 
think we all start from the same goal, but it really is difficult to figure out what’s going to 
work.   
 
19:42:50 
 
But I do look at Europe and the fact that they’ve gone down this path of deficit spending 
and it really does seem to eventually lead you into a cul-de-sac.  And they’re in very 
serious trouble. And I worry about, I have three kids, I don’t want America to be like 
Greece in 15 or 20 years.

John Donvan: 
All right, I’m going to go to questions from the audience. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Can I just make one point? 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me just do this, and then while the mic’s are moving, you can make your point, are 
you cool with that? 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Sure. 
 
John Donvan: 
So, what will happen is, if you raise your hand, I’ll find you and a microphone will be 
brought to you.  We ask you to stand up and tell us your name and then ask a question 
that is focused, terse, on point, and really is a question.  And no two parters or three 
parters.  And also what doesn’t work is, I’d like to hear every member of the panel tell 
me their list of [unintelligible] because it would just take up too much time.  So those 
are the questions that I’ll have to throw out, so I just want you to think about that.  And 
while you’re getting ready, Cecilia. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
I just wanted to thank Dan for bringing up Germany and Canada.  Because, one of the 
reasons why many people believe that, especially Germany, which had a larger, or 
Germany did not suffer the same employment losses that we did and many people have 
asked why.   
 
19:43:59 
 
And Canada as well, and both of them have work sharing programs, which were very 
active.  So many people believe, and again if you ask German economists what exactly 
explains it, you’ll get many answers.  But one of the reasons is because German 
employers were not obligated to try to adjust to the downturn by laying off all of their 
workers.  That’s a lot of the reason why the president actually was looking to Germany 
and we’ve been trying to expand our own work sharing program for exactly this reason. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
You could do work share programs voluntarily without government intervention. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, let’s go to some questions from the audience.  Sir, right there.  Yeah, yes sir.  
Remember the rules.

Robin Yellen: 
Daniel. 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you tell us who you are? 
 
Robin Yellen: 
My name's Robin Yellen [spelled phonetically]. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you. 
 
Robin Yellen: 
You mentioned just now that, to me the whole argument is stimulus, no stimulus, this is 
basically what it sounds like to me.   
 
19:44:59 
 
Now, you’ve mentioned earlier that in, after the First World War, there was a recession, 
but America survived it, and everything came right.  After the Second World War, the 
same thing. But after two world wars, countries were in situations where they had to 
build.  They had to rebuild. They had to restructure everything.  And that, to me, is what 
President Obama is proposing, is the restructuring, building again to get things going.  
Do you not think that's -- that was a stimulus all on its own? 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Dan Mitchell. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
If I understand your question correctly, no, I don't.  The reason I pointed out the 
recession of 1920, which, if we didn't have the Great Depression that would have been 
viewed as our Great Depression because the macroeconomic numbers were absolutely 
terrible then, worse than anything we had ever experienced.   
 
19:45:53 
 
And politicians didn't do anything, and the economy quickly recovered.  We've always 
had downturns.  And the question is how quickly do we get out of the downturn, what 
malinvestments and economic mistakes were made, and did the economy have the 
ability to quickly adjust?  My concern about stimulus, if you define stimulus by 
government involvement and intervention, I think it hinders and retards the economy's 
ability to adjust and to sort of digest the mistake that caused resources to be 
misallocated.  And I think what's happening today, not only under Obama, but also 
under Bush, we have gotten to a point where government is so big, so -- you know, just

involved in all sectors of the economy, not just spending and taxes, but regulations and 
intervention, the types of thing Richard was talking about.  We have moved to a lower 
growth level that we may be stuck with permanently in the same way that Europeans 
have had these, for decades now, slower rates of economic growth. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
And that's what's important to me. 
 
John Donvan: 
Along the right side.   
 
19:46:55 
 
Oh, I thought I saw a bunch of hands go up there.  Sorry.  Right in the center here.  Yes.  
If you look to your right, I think it'll come faster. 
 
Gene Epstein: 
My name is Gene Epstein.  A question for those who support the proposal.  If there is 
indeed a crying need for jobs right now, and if there are indeed structural problems in 
the economy, partly caused by government right now, that could be altered, wouldn't 
you want to pick up on Richard Epstein's proposal right now to address those problems 
so that we can have job creation, such as the harassment of Boeing, the greater --

I'm going to stop you there because you --

You actually asked a perfect question, and so Mark Zandi, do you want to take that on? 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Hi, Gene.  How are you?  Good to see you.  I recognize the voice.  Yeah.  We haven't 
talked in a while.

[laughter] 
 
Please give me a call, Gene.  Yeah. 
 
19:47:53  
 
Gene Epstein: 
You don't return my calls, Zandi. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Oh, yeah, yeah.  I return everybody's call.  I think I would do both.  I think Cece said it 
nicely.  You know, policy makers can walk and chew gum at the same time.  And we 
need to do that.  I do sympathize with a lot of the points that are being made with 
respect to regulatory policy and government intervention.  I do think some of the policy 
steps have created uncertainty for businesses and for the banking system.  And that's 
impaired the ability and willingness of businesses to step up and hire and for banks to 
lend.  So I sympathize with that perspective.  And I think we need to work on policies to 
address that.  But that does not preclude the fact that we need to reduce some of the 
fiscal restraint that's dead ahead of us.  If we don't make some policy steps here, taxes 
are going to rise on everybody.  Unemployment insurance for many hard-pressed 
households are going to expire.  And that's the prescription for a recession. 
 
19:48:55  
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Now speaking of right now, I want to mention our media partner in these 
debates is Slate.  And in fact we're being live-streamed on Slate right now.  So to 
everybody who's watching on Slate, welcome.  And thanks for being with us.  And we've 
asked you to submit questions.  And there's a "right now" type of question, or its 
reverse from a Rhonda DuBose -- I'm sorry, from a Darin Clements in Williamsburg, 
Missouri, who asks, since the jobs bill is basically a temporary funding program, what 
are -- what are the prospects for this actually having an impact on long-term 
employment?  Are we really talking about jobs, or are we only talking about getting 
money into the system for stimulus?  Are people really going to be better employed in 
the long term as a result of this program? 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Can I -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Cecilia Rouse. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Yeah, please. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Here's the -- this is what I worry about.  I think our economy has made significant 
progress in righting the wrongs that got us into this mess.  We've reduced debt.  The 
businesses are in very good shape financially.  Households have made a lot of progress.  
There's work to be done.  
 
19:49:58 
 
We've got foreclosure issues.  The banking system is recapitalized.  We've made 
significant progress.  We're on the verge of a much better economy.  But if we go back 
into recession, all that good, hard work is going to go down the tubes.  And this is going 
to cost us enormously. We go into recession, revenues are going to fall because there's 
going to be fewer people employed.  Government spending's going to rise because 
there's automatic spending increases in our budget.  People become unemployed, 
they'll go get unemployment insurance. It's going to cost us more than this package, a 
lot more than this package.  So it's not only about the very near term.  It's about the 
long run.  We can't take that chance.  If we go into recession, it's going to undermine the 
fundamentals of our economy. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mark, the question is a little bit different.  It's about people actually having -- having 
jobs, having careers, if you will, being able to count on this going forward.  And your 
opponents have argued that one of the problems they see with this, particularly 
something like -- like the tax holiday that's being offered to employers, it's a holiday, 
then it ends.  And it's so short term that there's no real incentive for a company to hire 
workers. 
 
19:51:00  
 
Mark Zandi: 
But this is the point, John.  This is -- let me try one more time.  Listen, if we go back into 
recession, all those fundamentals of our economy are going to erode.  All the good 
things, all the progress we've made is going is go away, and it's going to hurt the ability 
of businesses to hire and people to get jobs for the long run, for a long time to come.  
We are running the risk of going into a Japanese-like decade if we go back in a recession 
in six to nine months.  We just can't allow that to happen. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
But the difficulty -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Richard Epstein. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Richard Epstein: 
-- with that is you can go into recession in 16 to 18 months.  And you're talking about 
the short-term disasters.  What about the midterm disasters?  The advantage of the 
deregulation on the labor market side, which could be quite big, getting rid of industrial 
policies, no more cylinders and so forth, is that has an effect today.  It has a long-term 
effect.  It reduces the size of government burdens, and it increases the gains from 
potential hiring of labor.   
 
19:51:54 
 
So I'm going to ask you, Mark, just plain out, if you're in favor of this bill.  Would you get 
rid of the Davis Bacon provision and the -- and the ARRA [spelled phonetically] provision 
and the unemployment discrimination provision?  I think the answer's got to be yes. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
This gets to the question of political economy.  We have no time left. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
But you are -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Wait, wait, wait.  If you want -- you asked me a question.  I'm going to answer it.  If we 
go down that path of trying to repeal these laws that have been in statute since 1930, 
we'll be debating this 10 years from now.  And we're toast. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
That's not the -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
So in -- and here's the other point.  And I'm going to ask you a question.  Of $450 billion 
in the package -- 
 
Richard Epstein: 
What? 
 
Mark Zandi: 
$450 billion package.  How much of that is subject to the statutes that you are 
concerned about by America? 
 
Richard Epstein: 
A fair -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

No.  How much, exactly? 
 
Richard Epstein: 
I don't know the exact number. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
$50 billion. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Okay. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
50 out of the 450 billion. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Okay.  Let's get -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
 
[applause] 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Let's go back to the other point. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
I read the statute as well. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
No, no, no.  That may be for the ARRA provisions.

You've got the Davis Bacon provisions.  You've got the employment discrimination 
provisions. Which [unintelligible].  And so I'm not asking you to repeal the statutes as 
they exist everywhere else.  I'm asking you not to put them in this particular bill.  We're 
going piece by piece.  Will you get rid of these pieces?  You don't have to repeal 
anything.  You don't have to have a long-term debate.  All you have to say is, not with 
this one now.  And all you've told me is you don't think it's going to do a lot of good.  I'm 
going to tell you it's going to do at least some harm.  And spending nothing on this is a 
lot better than trying to say, we have to tie the two things together. You know it's a 
political fix.  I know it's a political fix.

Cecilia Rouse. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Just disentangle. 
 
John Donvan: 
Cecilia Rouse. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
I just wanted to say something about the anti-discrimination provision. 
 
John Donvan: 
And take one minute -- 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
To say what it is. 
 
John Donvan: 
Not even a minute, 15 seconds to remind us what this is about. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
I was going to do that.  So many employers have actually been having their ads, when 
they post for employment, they say, "if you are unemployed, you need not apply."  We'll 
not consider -- or you must currently have a job.   
 
19:53:53 
 
So many employers have this in statute -- or not in statute, but they have that in their 
ads.  And as a result, many people are concerned that this is not particularly conducive 
to employment growth.  So, I understand that employers are being inundated with 
applications and with applicants.  There are over four unemployed workers for every job 
opening.  And employers are having to find ways to really sift through.  And I also 
understand that we want to let employers hire who they need to hire, who they think is 
the best match.  But let's think of some of the negative spillovers of these ads to the rest 
of society, which is where I think we have a place for government intervention.  First of 
all, imagine you're an unemployed worker.  Especially imagine you're an unemployed 
worker who's been unemployed for at least six months.  So you're actually bordering on 
discouraged.  I actually know of a single mother who has been on welfare and is -- you 
know, marginally thinks she's not very attractive to employers.  You understand that 
employers are putting out these ads, you don't even try to get a job.   
 
19:54:51 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And the worst thing we want to do right now is to discourage workers from even trying, 
from even applying for jobs.  So one is I think it discourages workers from even trying to 
get hired. The second negative spillover is that in our economy one of the ways in which 
young people in particular have job growth early in their career is by quitting jobs.  We 
have a lot of dynamism in our labor market, and one of the problems we have right now 
is actually because of the labor market, we have fewer quits than we normally would 
have, and as a result, workers are staying in jobs, they're not quitting, and so they're not 
going to be climbing up the career ladder.  It's a negative spillover to the rest of society. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, Cecilia, let me stop you there for some response -- 
 
Richard Epstein: 
You know, look, I mean -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Dan Miller, please -- Richard, let Dan Miller come in. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Mitchell, but that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm -- 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
-- but I'll go by Miller. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
No, there is no Miller here, Dan Mitchell. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
I want to make a point that some of you should get ready to hiss about because I think 
this point makes perfect sense but some people don't like it, employers only hire people 
that they think is going to make them money.   
 
19:55:52 
 
And so, therefore, when we're considering what is going to increase -- oh, you're ruining 
my fun by clapping instead of hissing -- 
 
[laughter] 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

-- so when we're thinking about what in terms of like the boots on the ground type 
issue, what is going to convince companies to hire workers?  If you create a new 
potential legal liability with new government rules about how you're writing your want 
ads and who you're allowed to hire and what you're allowed to say when you're 
interviewing, is that going to increase or decrease the likelihood that companies are 
going to want to hire new people?  We want workers to be an asset to firms, not a 
liability, and this gets into of course all the other policies about what are the -- if we 
lower tax rates, will that help?  If we reduce government regulation of red tape, will that 
help?  I think markets, I think copying Hong Kong is a better idea than copying France.  
That in some sense is the summary of everything I would say this evening. 
 
John Donvan: 
Dan Mitchell, slight -- 
 
[applause] 
 
-- slight variation on that question, is not having held a job for six to nine months to a 
year an accurate indicator of your ability to do a job well and to hold onto a job? 
 
19:56:58  
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Well, there's no question we have a major problem with long term unemployment in 
this country. You know, five years ago I used to look at the OECD, Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development data, international bureaucracy based in Paris.  
They look at industrialized countries, all sorts of interesting data.  I don't think we 
should be subsidizing them, but that's a whole separate issue.  It used to be that you 
would look at the data on six months-plus unemployment, and Europe had the terrible 
numbers, and we had the great numbers.  And now we've gone up to Europe and in 
some cases beyond, in terms of our long term unemployment. Now, interestingly, 
scholars like Paul Krugman and Larry Summers, at least when they're outside their New 
York Times writing and their democratic administration appointments, have written that 
unemployment insurance subsidizes unemployment.  Now, as an economist -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what is the answer to my question, though?  
 
19:57:48  
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Well, no, I'm making -- the answer to your question is that we have a problem with long 
term unemployment, one of the reasons we have this problem is because the academic 
data shows that people get jobs much quicker when their unemployment insurance runs 
out, but we now are going on 99 weeks of unemployment insurance, and it sounds like 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

you're an ogre, and, yes, so hiss me, hiss me, but when even Larry Summers and Paul 
Krugman and their academic writings are saying, "This increases unemployment," we 
need to figure out a better way of doing it then. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mark -- Mark Zandi, Mark Zandi, please. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
I just want to make one point about the jobs package.  You know, there is money in the 
package, about 50 billion for unemployment insurance -- additional unemployment 
insurance, but in addition to that, there are a number of reforms to the unemployment 
insurance system that have been proposed.  When Cece talked about the work share 
that's very popular in Germany and credited for German success, there's also a very 
popular program in Georgia called Georgia Works that helps send unemployed workers 
to get on the job training.  These are things that have historically had bipartisan support.  
There's empirical evidence that they work reasonably well.   
 
19:58:55 
 
They do address some of the concerns Dan brought up.  I -- they're reasonable concerns.  
You know, you can't dismiss them.  So I think it's very important to realize that in the 
package there are efforts to address some of these things. 
 
John Donvan: 
Richard Epstein. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Yes, I mean, to go back to the discrimination point and the part time point, on the 
discrimination issue, the evidence suggests that 150 firms have announced that they will 
not consider people.  There are obviously going to be some more -- you're talking about 
millions of companies, and many people get first jobs, and it seems to me that you can -- 
if you got rid of minimum wage that's for teenagers it would do much more because 
then what you could do is to handle the problem of your decreased skills which 
everybody agrees takes place by making a compensating wage offer.  And so freeing up 
markets will do much better than putting additional burdens on the overall economy in 
the way in which you're doing.   
 
19:59:46 
 
With respect to part time workers and so forth, the other thing to remember is we've 
had a long term policy in which there's constantly the notion that there are mandates 
for the kinds of benefits that you must supply to full time employees, which leads to this 
fine art where everybody now tries to become an independent contractor so you don't 
have to supply health insurance in a variety of other situations.  One way to improve the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

employment situation is to drop the mandate.  And put it in another term.  What the 
government has now said, there will be no jobs with lavish benefits or you can have real 
jobs with less benefits.  In my view, if you’re trying to increase the employment levels, 
what you have to do is to stop putting the ties.  If you wish to hire X, you must provide 
for them Y.  Because what happens is that’s often the decider and it kills the labor 
markets.  What we did for many, many years is to think that labor markets were robust 
so you could burden them with all sorts of restrictions.  When you get bad times, these 
restrictions are a lot more costly and what they do is they create a lot more devastation.  
You can improve this market tomorrow. 
 
John Donvan: 
Richard, I have to stop you thee because I need to take a break.  Do you know that when 
you speak, there’s only commas at the end of everything you say? 
 
[laughter] 
 
20:00:53  
 
I was looking for the period to break in, and there were semicolons and dashes and 
commas. 
 
[applause] 
 
Richard Epstein: 
One continuous argument. 
 
John Donvan: 
Cecilia, I’m going to do a little break and then I’m going to come back to have you 
respond to it and then we’re going to go back to questions from the audience.  Now I 
need some spontaneous applause from you, if you can do that. Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "Congress should pass Obama’s jobs plan piece by piece."  We’re in the 
question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate.  I’m John Donvan 
of ABC News. We have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing this out and we are 
talking about the part of the jobs bill that would outlaw discrimination against workers 
who have been unemployed.  And Cecilia Rouse is going to take up the point. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
So I just wanted to come back to that for just a moment because this law, what this 
proposes is not saying that employers have to hire a specific person.   
 
20:01:54 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
What it says is one, you can’t put it in the ad.  Okay that is true, that is a restriction.  You 
can’t put in the ad that you will not look at an unemployed person.  And two it says that 
there can’t be a blanket policy, so there can’t be a memo.  So what is -- let me say, it’s a 
largely symbolic gesture.  The Obama administration caps damages at a thousand 
dollars if you actually put something in an ad.  It caps it at $5,000 if you can come up 
with, if the EEOC, Equal Opportunity Employment Commission can actually come up 
with a memo documenting it.  So it’s not, it’s meant to say look, we need for, at least, 
there not to be overt discrimination against those who are unemployed so we don’t 
discourage workers from trying to apply to a job. 
 
John Donvan: 
Doesn’t the act though also, allow for a waiver that there would be a government 
official who would have the job of saying well in this case, we’re going to give you a 
pass.  Which does sound to me like one more layer of somebody making decisions for 
who you can hire and who you can’t and the ultimately this sin that is considered un-
committable, you can commit if the government guy says this time we’ll let you go. 
 
20:02:57  
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Look, it really is meant to -- Governor Christie in my fair state, our Governor Christie 
passed a law that was similar.  I’m not saying that makes it okay.  But what I’m saying is 
that, it really is a problem if unemployed workers are discouraged from applying for 
jobs.  And it's really just saying employers try to make -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Let’s move on to another topic.  In the red top, thanks. 
 
Shaila Dewan: 
I’m Shaila Dewan from the New York Times and my question is for the no side.  And the 
question is, what do you propose for the short term.  I mean, if your proposals all seem 
to be about long term issues, if we’re going to do a tax cut, let’s make it permanent, that 
kind of thing.  But what do you do for those unemployed people when their payments 
stop and they can’t get a job because there aren’t enough jobs? 
 
John Donvan: 
What is your fire truck from the firehouse I think is the question.  Richard Epstein. 
 
[applause] 
 
Richard Epstein: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

The answer that I said is, the only way this thing will stop is through liberalization of 
markets.   
 
20:03:55 
 
If you repeal the restrictions against people getting jobs, employers will start to hire 
again.  The difficulty with the umemployment situation is that the amount of revenues 
we have to spend now is probably two or three times the amount of taxes that we 
collect.  And what happens is you will not be able to reverse that pattern so long as you 
think that stimulus at the grand level -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But Richard, the question is what is your short term solution? 
 
Richard Epstein: 
My short term solution is deregulation.  Get rid of mandates, get rid of minimum wages, 
get rid of the anti-discrimination proposals and so forth.  Because what you laugh about, 
I think it’s fine for you to laugh, but I think you also ought to reflect upon the fact that if 
you don’t have gains from trade, you don’t get employment.  And what’s happened is 
every time you put an implicit tax on the trade, what you do is release the opportunities 
for gains.  This is the interesting feature about this, is the macroeconomic stuff 
everybody guesses about.  The microeconomic stuff is perfectly clear. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, your partner Dan Mitchell. 
 
20:04:53  
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
I would just like to make the point that good long-term policy also happens to be good 
short term policy.  Now I come from a school of thought that says that if the economy 
has misallocation of labor and capital and a recession gets baked into the cake, there's 
not much you can do but sort of just grit your teeth and try to get through it as quickly 
as possible.  But government sometimes extends and delays and an economic downturn 
by interfering.  I think that's what happened in the 1930s with the Hoover-Roosevelt 
policies.  I want to have a lower burden of government.  I sort of throughout, as a 
throwaway line, I want to be Hong Kong rather than France.  But there's actually a very 
serious point behind it.  If you look at all these different measures of economic freedom, 
Hong Kong's always near the top.  And France, among industrialized countries, is down 
lower.  And I think that is one of the reasons why Hong Kong grows five to six percent a 
year on average, and France grows one to two percent a year.  And if we want the 
unemployed to get jobs, we want a strong, tight labor market like we had during the 
Clinton years when government spending fell from 22 percent of GDP to 18 percent of 
GDP. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
20:05:57 
 
And what happened during the Reagan years when we also had more free market 
oriented policies.  That, I think is the best answer. 
 
John Donvan: 
Cecilia mentioned much earlier that Clinton raised taxes on the wealthy, and things got 
really good. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
No.  He -- Clinton raised taxes, but he also did GAT and NAFTA and welfare reform, 
reduced government spending by four percentage points of GDP.  He deregulated 
telecommunications and agriculture.  I mean, if I could take everything else of Clinton's 
policies and it meant that I had to take the 39.6 percent marginal tax rate, I'd do it.  We 
had a lot more economic freedom under Clinton than we've had under Bush and 
Obama. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Let's take another question from the audience.  Ma'am?  Yep.  If you can stand 
and tell us your name. 
 
Jane Doe: 
Hi.  My name is Jane Doe, and I'm proud to say I'm not from -- I'm not from the New 
York Times.  My question is for Cecilia.  By your own admission, you said that the Clinton 
administration was able to -- to increase economic growth, but did so because of 
monetary policy.   
 
20:06:59 
 
And even President Clinton has said so on the Daily Show.  My understanding is it's not 
the job of the president to intervene in monetary policy.  He's admitted that he's gone 
into -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you come to a question? 
 
Jane Doe: 
Yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thanks. 
 
Jane Doe:

-- in two seconds.  Sorry.  I paid a hundred thousand dollars to go to this university 
during the Clinton administration, so I'd like to make my point and have her answer the 
question. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, but other people want to speak. 
 
Jane Doe: 
My question is about monetary policy and the Clinton administration.  I'm a Democrat. 
His policies of fiscal policy did not increase economic growth.  It was his monetary 
policy.  Could you comment on it? 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Well, look, I think that there was a lot of good fiscal policy that happened under the 
Clinton administration as well.  So I'm not going to agree with your premise that it was 
only the monetary policy and that there was no fiscal policy under Clinton.  Now, was it 
necessarily fiscal policy in terms of stimulus as Dan has mentioned?   
 
20:07:55 
 
There was a lot of other--there was NAFTA.  There were other attempts to stimulate 
economic growth.  But -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no.  Can -- no, we -- seriously.  And also I want to move on because we're not talking 
about the Clinton administration. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
Exactly. 
 
John Donvan: 
And -- and, sir, down in the front.  I hope you have gotten your money's worth, though, 
in terms of a diploma and the whole thing. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Question for Dan Mitchell.  You earlier mentioned Germany.  Now, looking at this 
[unintelligible], on the one side, it increases taxes for high income Americans but it 
reduces taxes for lower income Americans.  Isn't that what -- what has been done in 
Germany? 
 
John Donvan: 
That's how you do a question.  Dan Mitchell. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

As the Germans would say, "Der good.  Der good." 
 
[applause] 
 
What I was focusing on in my comments on Germany is what happened to government 
spending as a share of GDP.  Germany did not do a big Keynesian stimulus program.   
 
20:08:52 
 
It doesn't mean that I want to embrace German fiscal policy because the overall burden 
of government spending is higher, actually not that much higher than it is in the U.S.  
They're something like 44 percent of GDP.  We're getting close to 40 now after the 
Bush-Obama spending binge.  But Germany didn't do a Keynesian stimulus package of 
any magnitude close to the U.S.  And I think that served them well, similar to what 
happened in Canada.  Now, other things were involved.  Canada never had a housing 
bubble.  And of course that helped a lot.  There's a ton of different economic policies 
that matter.  But my point on Germany was just a simple one, that they didn't do the 
Keynesian policy -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, Mark -- Mark Zandi would actually like a crack at that question. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah, no, I was just going to make the point that the Germans provided just as much 
fiscal support to their economy as we did in the recession.  The difference is that in 
Germany, they have automatic stable -- what's called automatic stabilizers in their 
budget.  That means that there is more unemployment insurance.  There is more 
welfare.   
 
20:09:51 
 
There are -- the tax code is such that you generate a lot more fiscal support.  In the U.S., 
we have some automatic stabilizers, but they're not nearly as large as in Europe. And 
therefore, when we get into recessions, we rely more on what we're calling fiscal 
stimulus. That is temporary tax cuts and temporary spending. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
So in terms of the fiscal support to the economy, the Germans did exactly what we did 
in terms of the GDP. 
 
John Donvan:

It's hard for me to see folks that are not in the lights, so I have to keep calling down 
towards the front.  If somebody is up there, wants to take a step down, I'll try to call on 
you.  But for -- oh, actually, yeah, so I see you standing up.  Can you come down into the

Mark Zandi:

Arthur Tannenbaum: 
Arthur Tannenbaum. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you. 
 
20:10:56  
 
Arthur Tannenbaum: 
From where I sit, you've been talking mostly about structural issues.  This motion is 
supposed to be directed towards cyclical issue.  So my question for you is this:  Isn't it a 
fact that we've had a number of recessions since World War II?  There's been some form 
of stimulus that was the response to each of those recessions?  And we have always 
come out of these recessions and started growing again. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Dan Mitchell. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Well, the question is -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, Richard, do you want to take it? 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Richard Epstein: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Richard Epstein. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Richard Epstein: 
Why not?  I mean, I think it's a fair question.  But, of course, we always came out of 
them.  We're not coming out of them now.  So the question is, what's the source of the 
difference?  And the answer is that the degree of regulation that you have with respect 
to the economy now has deprived it of the kind of flexibility that allows it to respond.  
And it's in all the markets [unintelligible].  Thus far we've talked mainly about labor 
markets.  And those are completely tied up by the kind of regulations that are put into 
place.   
 
20:11:55 
 
Every point and effort to try to revive the housing markets by giving mortgage support 
programs have turned out to be complete failures.  The correct response on that may 
sound harsh, but in fact, it's the only way to get back the stability which is that banks 
decide to foreclose, tenants, current owners go, and the property re-circulates at lower 
rates so that you get the housing market start.  You cannot keep a housing market going 
when essentially you allow people to remain in possession while the underlying value of 
the assets go down.  So our position is really quite this.  This stimulus program we don't 
think it does very much good and has already exhausted itself.  But the mid-level 
regulations that you see in mortgages, in labor, in the banking industry, in the health 
care industry, all of these things are novel drags.  These are discreet programs 
introduced by -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  I'm going to -- I'm going to stop you because -- 
 
Richard Epstein: 
[unintelligible] and those are the source of the difficulty. 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to stop you because we have to let you make you that point.  And, sir, in the 
blue shirt. Yep, if you can stand, please. 
 
Scott Stevens: 
My name is Scott Stevens, and I have a question for Mr. Zandi.

20:12:55 
 
You say that the $450 billion stimulus should keep us out of recession.  Could you put a 
number on that?  How many percent in growth do you think we'll get from the stimulus 
compared to the counter factual?  Is that enough, do you think?  And -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I think your answer to that is quoted on the White House blog, actually. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah, it is. 
 
Scott Stevens: 
I haven't had a chance to read that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah.  Which, as I said earlier, means it's right, right?

So, Mark, why don't you take that question?  Put --

Do you have something else you'd like to say?

I'd like to keep it as a one-part -- 
 
Scott Stevens: 
It's enough and -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan:

You like that, huh?   
 
20:13:50 
 
Well, if you do the arithmetic, the math, under current policy, if there is no change in 
policy, federal fiscal policy will shave 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth in 2012.  
State and local governments’ cuts will take the total fiscal drag -- this is the headwind to 
the economy -- to two percentage points of GDP.  The Obama jobs package provides 
stimulus equal to two percent of GDP.  So the intent is to neutralize the fiscal drag.  
Now, you know, if I were king for the day, I'd say, you know, we can digest some fiscal 
austerity.  We don't have to go the whole Monty here, but we need to do something.  
We can't just -- we're not going to be able to digest two percentage points 
[unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  So you were very specific.  I want to go to the other side and say that he was 
very specific. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Well, there's a certain beauty to being exact about something.  But if you go back and 
look at what Mark was saying in 2010 and what Mark was saying in 2009 and what Mark 
was saying in 2008, and then you compare those things to reality, they're always 
different than what actually happened.   
 
20:15:01 
 
Now, of course, Mark will say, but other things happened in the economy. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
No, no, I think I got it right.

[laughter] 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
But I think this gets at the problem that when you have a model that presupposes the 
results, Mark has a model and if you put in the certain amount of government spending, 
that will automatically spit out a certain number of GDP unemployment, probably 
depending on how it's spent.  I'm sure there are some greater details to it.  CPO has the 
same model, and these are the kinds of models that gave us the White House, I guess, 
Transition Team document that said if we squandered $850 billion, our unemployment 
rate would never go above eight percent, and it just didn't work.  It doesn't matter how 
many decimals you have in your estimate.  If the fundamental underlying premise is 
wrong, it doesn't work. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, on that -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
You're not giving me a chance to respond to that, John?  What's that all about? 
 
20:15:53  
 
John Donvan: 
You're going to say you were right. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Okay, all right. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
That's really why I'm not coming back.  You're going to say you were right.  And down 
the front? 
 
Giovan Jucovovic: 
Hi, my name is Giovan Jucovovic [spelled phonetically].  I would like to ask a question to 
the opponent to this.  You seem to be presenting a broader and more long term vision 
for what you think with deregulation and whatnot.  I would like to know how your plan 
of deregulation in general in the economy would benefit Americans besides the 
wealthiest of Americans and what specifically this would do by creating, like you say, 
abolishing minimum wage, creating low paying jobs, how would this really benefit 
Americans as a whole and not just the top one percent? 
 
John Donvan: 
And how soon?

Richard Epstein: 
The top one percent -- 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Richard Epstein. 
 
Richard Epstein: 
First of all, with respect to the top one percent, I think one ought to look at some of the 
numbers. The amount of revenue that has been collected from the top one percent in 
the last -- from 2007 to 2009 declined by about 30 percent, so that what you're trying to 
do is to hit a top figure and assume that nothing you could do to them can hurt them.   
 
20:17:00 
 
They have been hurt in terms of the money they have very much. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Oh, laugh, if you may, but remember, 40 percent of that goes into your tax revenues.  So 
every time, what you do is you cut the revenue at the top, you cut the revenue for the 
programs that are needed to support the stimulus.  Dream on if you think that you can 
avoid that kind of situation.  If you reduce income at the top, you reduce the amount of 
money available for transfer [spelled phonetically]. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mark Zandi, do you -- 
 
Richard Epstein: 
At the bottom, what you have to do is if you reduce these things, you would get people 
on the job ladder.  The moment they are on the job ladder because employers now find 
it in their interest, they will advance.  When you look at -- for example if people could 
get in at minimum wage jobs, typically within six months or less they have managed to 
promote themselves to another type of job.  This can take place immediately, but it will 
not take place by employers unless they have some confidence in the long term stability 
of the system.   
 
20:17:52 
 
Every major tax measure that we have now has a two-year timeframe on it so that the 
uncertainty dominates in my judgment the kinds of stimulus that you hope to get by the 
spending policy.

John Donvan: 
And that concludes round two of our debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
And here's where we are -- we're about to hear a brief closing statement from each 
debater in turn, they will be two minutes each, uninterrupted.  And remember how you 
voted before the debate, because this is their last chance to try to persuade you to vote 
for their arguments at the end, and the team that has changed the most minds will be 
declared our winner.  So on to round three.  These are closing statements from each 
debater in turn, two minutes each.  Our motion is this, "Congress should pass Obama's 
jobs plan piece by piece," and here to summarize his position against this motion, Daniel 
Mitchell, senior fellow at the Cato Institute. 
 
Daniel Mitchell: 
Congress should not pass the president's job proposal either in its entirety or piece by 
piece because it represents a fundamentally misguided view of the economy, that you 
can make yourself richer by taking money out of one pocket and putting it in the other.   
 
20:18:55 
 
I think the historical evidence, the cross-country evidence does not support the 
Keynesian theory.  But more importantly, I think good long run policy is good short run 
policy.  I want to try to get back the labor market conditions we had under Reagan and 
Clinton, and the one common characteristic of what we had under both Reagan and 
Clinton was that economic freedom in America broadly defined -- so we're not just 
talking the fiscal policy, but more than just fiscal policy affects the economy -- economic 
freedom in America increased during the Reagan years and the Clinton years, by 
contrast, economic freedom declined during the Bush years, and that decline has 
continued during the Obama years.  And if we accept -- even if we don't like it, if we 
accept the notion that jobs are only created when employers think that it's going to be 
profitable to create those jobs, we need to figure out what type of economic conditions 
will lead to that greater prosperity.   
 
20:19:50 
 
And, again, I come back to what originally was a joke line, but I really want to make a 
premise, why is it that an economy like Hong Kong manages to grow so fast over such a 
long period of time, it takes in enormous amounts of immigrants, people rise from 
poverty to prosperity relatively quickly.  That’s the kind of economy I want to mimic.  
Not because I care about the top one percent.  The top one percent have never really, I 
don’t know, maybe some of them gave to the Cato Institute, so if you’re out there 
listening, I love you.  But I care a lot more about the people at the bottom than at the

top.  If there’s a recession, the Donald Trumps and Warren Buffetts and Bill Gates of the 
world never have to worry about how their household budget is going to be balanced.  
That’s why I want to copy Hong Kong.  In France, the rich people have figured how to 
work it; I don’t care about them.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you Daniel Mitchell. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion, "Congress should pass Obama’s job plan piece by piece" and here to 
summarize his position for the motion, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s 
Analytics. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Thank you John.  I want to thank you for the opportunity again.  And I commend the 
other group for articulating their views so thoughtfully.   
 
20:20:58 
 
I sympathize with a lot of what’s being said by the other group.  I do think that the 
economy is encumbered by regulatory, legal uncertainty.  We have made some major 
changes to our economy, to our health care system, to our banking system.  And these 
are difficult things for businesses and individuals to adjust to.  And I do think we need to 
work hard in reducing that regulatory and legal uncertainty.  And we do need to take 
steps to address our long-term problems.  Again I think it’s vital that we work to achieve 
fiscal sustainability, to get the long term deficits down so that our nation doesn’t go the 
way of Europe or France.  I think tax reform is absolutely vital.   
 
20:21:51 
 
I think it’s key to bring down the tax expenditures, the tax credits and deductions in the 
tax code, make the tax code much fairer, simpler.  I think our economy would be better 
for it.  And I actually am quite optimistic about our economic prospects.  I think, as I said 
earlier, we have come a long way.  Our economy has righted a lot of the wrongs that got 
us to this point. We’re really very close.  We just cannot go back into recession in the 
near future.  That would be damaging, the collective psyche is on edge.  You’re nervous; 
I’m nervous; we’re all very frazzled.  Recession will just tip us over.  The Obama jobs 
package, even if it’s passed in small parts, would go a long way to ensuring that we don’t 
go back into recession and that bright economic future actually will be upon us I think 
sooner than we realize.  Thank you.

John Donvan: 
Thank you Mark Zandi.  Our motion, "Congress should pass Obama’s jobs plan piece by 
piece," and here to summarize his position against this motion, Richard Epstein, 
professor at the New York University School of Law. 
 
20:22:58  
 
Richard Epstein: 
Yes, I think what happens is everybody agrees on the importance of trying to get both 
short term and long term proposals.  My view about this is, if we do not make long-term 
structural returns and make them soon, the stimulus program will not succeed.  The 
most that you could get out of this is six or nine months.  After that time, the long term 
structures will remain and you will fall into a recession that might be deeper than one 
that you take today.  So what is it that you have to do?  You have to try to figure out 
why it is that in the last 10 years it has been a lost decade in terms of economic growth.  
And the answer is not that the stimulus program does or does not work.  It is because all 
on mid-level institutions are inferior to what they were at an earlier time.  The labor 
markets have become much more regulated.  The banking industry has become much 
more concentrated at this particular point.  Dodd-Frank will introduce all sorts of layers 
of confusion.   
 
20:23:52 
 
The health care bill is a huge drain with respect to potential resources because the 
unemployment uncertainty is associated with the mandate and everything else are in 
fact going to wield a very heavy load on this system.  The question is when will this load 
be bourn?  The answer is it will be bourn today.  There is no way in effect that you can 
change the situation in the future if in fact you do not change the system correctly 
today.  Employers and everybody else in this economy has rational expectations which 
don’t only look at the short periods, they look at the long periods.  So if we start talking 
about stimulus programs which have never worked, what happens is we’re just going to 
add another layer of uncertainty on top of the layer of regulation. And we’ll be worse off 
than we are before.  The question then is, will liberalization work?  And the answer is if 
you engage in a systematic program of retrenchment and repeal, these things in fact will 
take effect immediately and you will start to see some kind of reversal. We do have a 
serious problem.   
 
20:24:53 
 
We must do something.  But if we think of the economy as being somebody with a 
diabetic shock, we ought not to add fix it, add to it some sugar. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you Richard Epstein.

The motion "Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece," and here to 
summarize her position in support of the motion, Cecilia Rouse, professor of economics 
at Princeton University. 
 
Cecilia Rouse: 
So I do believe that Congress should pass the Obama jobs plan.  I too am concerned 
about the impact of employer mandates on labor markets and believe we should be 
very judicious in looking at regulation.  I think we should only put into place regulations 
where the benefits clearly exceed the costs.  I think the evidence isn't really there that 
minimum wage is such an egregious regulation.  But that would be another debate.  
However, if the Clinton administration in the Clinton years were such an example of 
economic freedom, in 2001, we had a recession where we had a jobless recovery.  So 
what happened?  Did the regulatory environment magically change with an election?   
 
20:25:53 
 
I think that what we have is -- what that tells us is that this regulatory environment is 
not going to address the cyclical changes.  And I think we have a cyclical challenge right 
now.  And so I think it's appropriate for the Congress to step in.  Now, as I said from the 
outset, I think one of the most important pieces of this is one that's a tax relief for 
employees.  I think continuing the federally funded unemployment insurance benefit is 
very important as well. 
 
I just want to add to that that Congress has always extended these benefits during times 
of recession.  And the reason is clear.  It's pennywise and pound foolish not to do so.  If 
workers and their families aren't supported, they're going to end up on other 
government programs.  And so Congress -- even Reagan did not stop supporting 
unemployment insurance benefits until employment had fallen below 7.5 percent.  So I 
think Congress typically steps in during times of recession.  I think there are good 
economic reasons for it to do so.  And I think this is one of those times.  More 
importantly, you know, as Mark has said very carefully, we really do risk falling into 
another recession which will be just devastating for all of us.   
 
20:26:57 
 
Might doing nothing make a difference?  It might work.  But I've got to tell you, I'm not a 
gambling girl, and I'm just not willing to make that gamble for 42 million workers who 
are out of work and the millions more who are really suffering economically.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Cecilia Rouse.

And that concludes our closing statements.  And that means it's time to find out which 
side you feel argued best.  We want to go again -- we want to ask you again to go to the 
keyboards at your seat and to register your vote for the team that you feel presented 
the best argument on this motion:  "Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by 
piece."  If you feel that the side arguing for the motion has argued best, push number 
one.  If you feel that the side arguing against the motion has argued best, push number 
two.  And if you remain or became undecided, push number three.  And we'll have the 
results in about one minute and 17 seconds, actually.   
 
20:27:54 
 
Come up quite shortly.  Yes, yeah.  So while that's happening, I just want to -- I just want 
to say thanks to this panel for -- for the level of debate they brought to this and -- 
 
[applause] 
 
-- for the spirit and the style and the humor and the intelligence.  And to everybody who 
got up and asked a question, the questions were pretty good tonight, so I want to thank 
you for having the nerve to stand up and ask the questions.  We really do appreciate it. 
 
[applause] 
 
And to everybody who is out there watching on Slate, thank you to as well.  So our final 
debate of the season will be on Tuesday, November 15th.  And the motion that we're 
debating is this: "The world would be better off without religion."  Arguing for the 
motion -- arguing for the motion, the great, great grandson of Charles Darwin whose 
name tragically is not Darwin because that would be -- his name is Matthew Chapman.  
He is an author, and he is a filmmaker, and he's cofounder of Science Debate.   
 
20:28:53 
 
His debating partner is A.C. Grayling.  He is a renowned philosopher, humanist and an 
atheist who recently authored a book called "The Good Book:  A Secular Bible,” a 
manifesto for rational thought.  On the other side of that debate, we're going to have 
Dinesh D’Souza who is the president of the King's College and author of "What's so 
Great About Christianity?"  And Rabbi David Wolpe who was named one of the most 
influential rabbis in America by Newsweek.  We'll be announcing our spring topics next 
month.  Is that right, Dana?  Next month we're going to have a list of our topics for the 
spring season, and we'll have five more.  And we hope to see all of you there.  You can

yeah, you were great. These debates are being carried on hundreds of NPR stations 
across the nation, and it's glad -- it's good to have you all breathing and speaking and 
voicing your opinions.  So thank you.   
 
20:29:56 
 
It really gives a sense of life to it.  You're also on television here in New York City on 
WNET13 and WLIW and NJTV.  All right, now, it's all in.  We've had two teams arguing 
out this motion: "Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece." You voted 
twice, once before the debate to tell us where you stood on it, and again at the end of 
the debate after listening to these teams try to persuade you to their point of view.  
We've asked you to choose which team argued the best.  Here is the result.  Before the 
debate on this motion, "Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece," 45 
percent were for the motion, 16 percent against, and 39 percent undecided.  After the 
debate, 69 percent are for the motion.  That is up 24 percent.  22 percent are against, 
that's up only six percent.  30 percent -- nine percent are undecided.  That's down 30 
percent.  The team arguing for the motion that Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan 
piece by piece carries the debate.  Our congratulations to them.  Thank you for me, John 
Donvan.  And we'll see you next time.
