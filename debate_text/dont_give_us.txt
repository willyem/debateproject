And now I'd like to invite all of our debaters to the stage.

I'm told there's one exception to the no phone rule, and that is if you are Tweeting. You 

can Tweet to your heart's content.  And so that's it.  I also want to -- this is the last of our 

regular season in our fifth season of Intelligence Squared U.S.  And all of them are 

because of the generosity of our chairman, the Rosenkranz Foundation, who makes this 

all possible.  I'd like to welcome to the stage Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. 

 

[applause] 

 

Robert Rosenkranz: 

Well, thank you very much.  It's great to see you all.  And my task in these proceedings is 

to frame the debate, to give a sense of the arguments on both sides.   

 

18:48:49 

 

And for more than a century, the statue of liberty has welcomed visitors with an Emma 

Lazarus poem engraved on its pedestal. Tonight's motion comes from one of the most 




Intelligence Squared U.S. - 2 - 7/8/2014

famous lines in that poem, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning 

to breathe free."  Well, today, many would want to rewrite those lines to read “Give me 
your energetic, your affluent, your educated elites.”  But how should we feel about poorly 
educated, unskilled immigrants, especially those here illegally?  If we analyze the 

question in terms of costs and benefits, we can see that those who benefit from immigrant 

labor are a very different group than those who shoulder the costs.  And that may be why 

the issue is so controversial.   

 

18:49:49 

 

Employers of low-wage immigrant labor reach the major benefits, large scale farming 

operations benefit.  And as concerned as we all gain from lower food prices, owners and 

patrons of restaurants benefit.  Affluent household benefit from child care, landscape 

maintenance, housecleaning and all manner of other services that only immigrants seem 

eager to provide. The costs are borne very differently.  Low-wage immigrants receive 

more from government, especially state and local governments than they pay in taxes.  

The state provides education for their children.  It provides emergency medical care and 

array of other benefits.  In some communities, crime and drug issues disrupt the lives of 

law-abiding citizens and impose major costs for police, courts and prisons.   

 

18:50:52 

 

All these costs add up to a major fiscal drag.  And it's no wonder that states like Arizona 

favor stricter enforcement of existing laws.  And if we think about the question more 

philosophically, both sides of the debate can cite appealing principles.  “Give us your 
tired, your poor, your huddled masses” does express American generosity of spirit, the 
vision of our nation as a beacon of opportunity and invokes a rich history of immigrant 

groups that have succeeded here. But equally appealing principles point in the opposite 

direction, respect for the rule of law and a basic sense of fairness are also bedrock 

American values.  Policies that reward those here illegally at the expense of those 

patiently waiting for legal status fly in the face of those principles.   

 

18:51:48 

 

Considering the costs and the benefits, considering the conflicting principles, which side 

of the argument should prevail?  Well, it's up to you to decide.  And it's now my privilege 

to turn the evening to our panelists and to our moderator, John Donvan.  Thank you, 

John. 

 

[applause] 

 

John Donvan: 

Thank you.  And I'd just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz 

for making this possible.

The famous verse inscribed on a plaque at the base of the Statue of Liberty says "Give me 

your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free."  But do we really all 

agree on what that means?  Or if we flip it around and say, "Don't give us your tired, your 

poor, your huddled masses," what does that mean?  Well, that's what we are here to 

debate.  This is another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan of ABC 

News.  We're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.   

 

18:52:45 

 

And here on the stage we have two teams of two members each to argue over this motion, 

"Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses."  We have a Texas mayor.  

We have a man who has written laws on immigration.  We have a former congressman 

and a journalist who has written about immigration who will be arguing this out and 

trying to change your minds because that's what this is.  This is a debate in which you, 

our live audience, are the judges.  By the time the debate has ended, you will have been 

asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards.  And the team that 

has changed the most minds will be declared our winners.  So let's go to your preliminary 

vote, where you stand on this issue before you actually hear the arguments.  There are 

key pads at your seat on the right hand side.  And if you agree with our motion, “Don't 
give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,” press number one. And, yes, you're 
voting for a negative so, it's a little bit tricky.  Be careful with that.  If you agree -- if you 

disagree with this motion, press number two.  And if you are undecided, push number 

three.   

 

18:53:49 

 

And if you think you made a mistake, just fix it, and the system will lock in your last 

vote.  And we're going to share the results of that vote at the end -- the vote that you just 

made at the end of the debate as we present both the before and the after votes to tell us 

who you chose as our winner.  So on to round one.  Round one, we have opening 

statements by each debater in turn. They are seven minutes each.  And with our motion, 

“Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,” speaking first for this 
motion, Tom Tancredo.  He's a former Colorado congressman who sought the 2008 

Republican nomination for president to bring attention to the issue of illegal immigration.  

And while the language of this debate is a little bit spicy and to a degree metaphorical 

because we know that you're not against all -- not against all immigration. It's not that 

absolute.  You did, nevertheless, sign up to argue for this side. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

That's right. 

 

John Donvan: 

Don't give us…

And, Tom, so in a sentence, why have you identified yourself so powerfully with this 

battle on illegal immigration? 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Well, I will be happy to answer that.  Let me first tell you that I must say in response to 

your discussion about the title of this debate, about the proposition itself, I was a little bit 

uptight about it originally because, after all, we are debating this issue here in New York 

City a few miles from Ellis Island.  And I have been -- I have participated in things in the 

past that have been a little bit skewed, and I can recall a spoof of me, a debate -- or 

actually it was supposed to be a little discussion between me and Vincente Fox, but it was 

a spoof on "Saturday Night Live," and so they had someone who looked like -- and I 

knew it was biased from the beginning, from the very beginning because the guy playing 

me looked like me and the guy playing Vincente Fox was Antonio Banderas -- 

 

[laughter] 

 

No fair, come on, guys. 

 

John Donvan: 

So to my question, in a sentence, why do you identify so powerfully with this? 

 

18:55:49 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Frankly, I -- you look at it and begin to think about the ramifications of immigration, both 

legal and illegal, and they are fascinating.  It is really one of the most intellectually 

stimulating areas of public policy I think we can possibly talk about. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay, we'll let you go, ladies and gentlemen, Tom Tancredo. 

 

[applause] 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

A great deal of mythology has built up around the Statue of Liberty, around the Emma 

Lazarus poem, and a lot of that mythology, of course, is just that.  It's mythology.  But 

unfortunately we have a tendency in the United States, we look back sort of nostalgically 

at a period of time because most of us are either children of or grandchildren of 

immigrants, and so the whole idea of immigration has a sort of a nostalgic appeal to us, 

and that's our first thought usually.  And I am the same way.  I am the grandson of Italian 

immigrants, came right here into Ellis Island.  

 

18:56:46 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And my parents being first generation Americans were very, very strict about one thing 

and that was to become an American, to become -- and it meant a lot of things to them in 

different ways, and I'll get to it in a minute, except that I do want you to understand I 

have that same nostalgic opinion to a large extent of what our immigration policy was, 

but we can't confuse that and make -- and develop true policy today based on mythology 

and, you know, some of the myths that we have to dispel.  I think tonight's a good place 

to do it, it’s -- first of all the Statue of Liberty was not a gift from France that was 
designed to explore the wonderful idea of open immigration.  Indeed it had nothing to do 

with immigration policy.  It had everything to do with extolling the virtues of a republic.  

In fact, the statue was called “Liberty Enlightening the World.”  It was not called 
“Liberty Inviting the World.”  As for the Emma Lazarus poem, it was added 30 years 
after the statue got here.  

 

18:57:50 

 

And it was about that time that the author of the poem, Ms. Lazarus, was talking about 

the need to limit immigration to various groups.  Remember also that a lot of the tired, 

and poor, and huddled masses got stamped “return to sender" here at Ellis Island.  There 
were people with dangerous elements and ailments like pinkeye or a cough or fever, and 

if anyone exhibited any degree of exhaustion by climbing the very steep stairway over at 

Ellis Island which was purposely built that way, that was one of the things that could get 

you sent home.  It was not a take all comers time in American history.  As for the poor, 

well, long before the Ellis Island experience, the colonies had enacted very, very stringent 

regulations about this particular aspect of immigration policy.   

 

18:58:51 

 

In New York in 1691, it required an immigrant to have, quote, "A visible estate or 

manual occupation or give a sufficient surety that he shall not be a burden or a charge to 

the respective place that he shall come to inhabit."  In 1996 in the Congress of the United 

States, they tried to actually expand on this and say that you had to have an affidavit 

signed by someone if you’re coming here, you had to have an affidavit of support.  They 
put it in, it was part of the Welfare Reform Bill, never, not one time, never has it been 

enforced.  And so the fact is we are in a -- unfortunately, we are importing a large degree 

of poverty into the United States.  The National Academy of Sciences along with the 

Center for Immigration studies shows that welfare use, the rates for welfare use, are 

significantly higher for immigrant households than they are for nonimmigrant 

households.   

 

18:59:45 

 

Federation for Immigration Reform could identify a net cost, net cost after taxes were 

paid by illegal immigrants, they were just focusing on that one part, a net cost to 

American taxpayers of over $150 billion annually.  Now, my point here is to show that 

for a long period of time in American history, we had what I would think was, and 

believe, is a rational policy.  It was rational for us to bring in a lot of people, especially 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 6 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

during the hay-day of American immigration, the 1890s and 1900s, a lot of people who 

were low-skill, low-wage people.  Why?  Because, of course, we were building the 

Industrial Revolution here.  They were fueling it.  That was appropriate.  It was right.  It 

served purpose for the people coming and it served a purpose for the people here.  I hope 

-- well, also, as I see we’re getting toward the end of that 7-minute period, there is 
another myth I want to try to dispel quickly.  

 

19:00:48 

 

And that is that immigration has always been sort of a straight-line increase from the time 

America started until today, that it’s always just been going up.  Absolutely untrue.  
About 1830 is when immigration began to be statistically relevant in the United States.  It 

started to climb.  By 1850, it started to go down.  Around 1880, it grew.  Around 1890, it 

declined.  It rose dramatically right before the First World War, but declined dramatically 

after the First World War with the Immigration Act of 1924.  It stayed relatively low for a 

long period of time until, as a matter of fact, 1965, when everything changed with the 

Immigration Act that was pushed by Senator Kennedy at the time, Senator Teddy 

Kennedy.  And we’ve had now really massive immigration, low-skill, low-wage workers 
ever since that period of time.   

 

19:01:48 

 

Now whether or not those -- that cyclical movement and that cyclical characterization I 

just gave you of immigration was purposeful or not.  It had and served a good purpose, I 

think.  We had periods of high immigration.  We had periods of low immigration.  And 

you know what happened during the periods of low immigration?  People used that time 

to assimilate.  And let me tell you, from my point of view, this is by far the most 

important aspect of the debate.  Assimilation -- we can have massive amounts of 

immigration to this country, the right time and the right type of immigration, especially, 

as I say, depending upon our needs here as long as we have assimilation along with it.  

Or, if it doesn’t happen along with it, it has to happen at that period of time that we take a 
break, which is not a bad idea for us to think about even now, because assimilation is not 

occurring.   

 

19:02:49 

 

It’s not occurring to the extent -- I mean, I know you can’t categorically say that, but it is 
certainly not occurring to the extent that we need it to in this country.  We desperately 

need, perhaps more than any country in the world, we need things to hold us together, to 

think about as being Americans, to connect together, not pull us apart.  And I’m afraid 
our immigration policy is doing just that. 

 

John Donvan: 

Thank you, Tom Tancredo.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 

Our motion is "Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses."  And here to 

argue against the motion, I’d like to introduce Julian Castro.  He is mayor of San 
Antonio, Texas.  He is a superstar in his party.  He was the youngest, at the time, the 

youngest member ever elected to the San Antonio Council and is now the youngest 

mayor of a major U.S. city, although, Julián, you know that if you stay in that job a lot 

longer, people are going to stop saying that. 

 

Julian Castro: 

I’m already starting to get the grey hair. 
 

19:03:47 

 

John Donvan: 

Ladies and gentlemen, Julian Castro. 

 

[applause] 

 

Julian Castro: 

Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, and let me say thank you, 

John, and to everyone here at “Intelligence Squared,” to Congressman Tancredo, 
Secretary Kobach, and to all the folks who showed up tonight.  We appreciate being here.  

Tamar Jacoby and I have the distinct pleasure of arguing against the motion on the table 

tonight.  You know, last week, I’m a little bit embarrassed to say that at 3:20 in the 
morning, Central Time, I woke up to flip on CNN to watch the Royal Wedding.  I admit 

it.  I couldn’t help myself.  It was one of those moments that you’d just rather see live 
than see on tape.  My wife didn’t even wake up.  She stayed asleep and I woke up.  And 
they had about two hours of coverage before the bride actually showed up on the 

doorstep of Westminster Abbey.  And in the background of the coverage in one of the 

shots on ABC or CNN -- 

 

19:04:46 

 

-- one of the networks that was covering it, there was laid out on a fence post, the United 

States flag, the flag of America.  And I was surprised to see that, although it was a 

welcome sight.  But there was something in my mind that told me that that American flag 

looked out of place at the Royal Wedding.  And as I thought about it more, the reason 

that our American flag looked out of place is because our country has never been a 

country about royalty or caste or one's station in life.  It has always been defined as a 

country for the strivers, for the aspirers, for the folks who can pull themselves up by their 

boot straps, who are willing to take the chance, the entrepreneurs, most of whom start off 

as folks of lesser means, folks who make themselves.  

 

19:05:46 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And this country, the United States, of all the countries in the world and all the countries 

throughout history, has defined itself as the nation that has taken in folks from around the 

world and allowed them to pursue their dreams, to reach their American dream and to 

become, from some who was poor and huddled among masses, to someone who is 

successful and able to enjoy the fruits of the capitalist system.  And so it is that I believe 

we need to continue to welcome not only the wealthy but the poor from other countries.  

We need to do that for several reasons.  The first is that immigrants are vital to our 

national economy.  Immigrants actually found companies at almost twice the rate of 

native born U.S. citizens.  Companies founded by immigrants in the years between 1995 

and 2005 actually created 450,000 jobs in the United States of America.   

 

19:06:46 

 

In one single year, they generated $52 billion in sales in industries like high technology 

and engineering; that the number of folks who start those companies is at 25 percent 

nationally.  And in Silicon Valley, it's at 52.4 percent.  And remember, it is a false 

distinction to think that the folks who found these companies start off as wealthy.  

Oftentimes they don't. Think about your own experience, either in your own family, or 

how many times have you heard someone tell the story of their family member who came 

here with just a few dollars in their pocket and were able to contribute great things to this 

country?  Congressman Tancredo also mentioned the idea of assimilation.  And I believe 

that it is important for folks generally to assimilate to a common culture in the United 

States.   

 

19:07:44 

 

And that's exactly what has been happening in the United States of America throughout 

our history with immigrants.  What we have seen consistently, and I think that 

Congressman Tancredo and I agree, what we have seen is that from time to time there has 

been this very intense concern about balkanization.  Benjamin Franklin famously said 

that we should rid Pennsylvania of the Germans in 1751.  We had the Alien and Sedition 

Act of 1798, the Chinese Exclusion Act.  We had the fear in the early 1940s during 

World War II that Germans and Japanese would somehow try and overthrow the 

government of the United States.  The reason that we have succeeded as a nation, that 

today we are the most powerful economy in the world is that we have been able to 

overcome those impulses.  And I believe that we need to continue to overcome those 

impulses for the future.  It's also incorrect to say that immigrants only take, and they don't 

give.   

 

19:08:49 

 

In 1993, the Urban Institute did a study that found that 94 percent of immigrants were not 

on welfare and that the distinction between immigrants and natives in terms of who was 

on welfare was less than three percent.  They also contribute up to $240 billion in taxes 

overall into Social Security and Medicare that they're actually never going to get a chance 

to use.  And the National Conference of State Legislatures, a few years ago, did an 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

analysis of 16 different states.  And they found that in five of those, including some of the 

biggest ones, New York and Texas, that there was a net positive from immigrants, 

including illegal immigrants, versus a negative.  And so this idea that they don't pay 

taxes, that they only take, that they're on welfare, the evidence clearly demonstrates that 

that's not the case.   

 

19:09:46 

 

I also believe, and I anticipate that some may argue that having so many folks come to 

our country is not good in terms of crime.  The numbers bear out that immigrant 

communities are actually safer than nonimmigrant communities.  Terrorism, the idea that 

somehow there are many folks walking across our borders that are going to commit acts 

of terror against folks in the United States.  I don't believe that's true, either.  In fact, in 

2010, of the 463,000 apprehensions that we had in the United States, two 10,000ths of 

one percent were apprehensions from folks that, excluding Cuba, were from countries 

that were listed as a state sponsor of terror.  What we're catching really are a whole bunch 

of folks who are yearning to breathe free, who are chasing the same values. Congressman 

Tancredo asked what's going to keep us together.  What's going to keep us together is 

what always has kept us together as a nation, the fact that people come here to work.   

 

19:10:51 

 

They're entrepreneurial.  They believe in democracy.  They're people of good faith.  They 

have the same values that have always made America great.  And I hope we'll continue to 

do so if we can get the policy right.  Thank you. 

 

John Donvan: 

Julian Castro, your time is up.  Thank you very much. 

 

[applause] 

 

So a reminder of where we are.  We are halfway through the opening statements of this 

“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 
debate.  I'm John Donvan of ABC News.  And we have four debaters, two teams of two, 

fighting it out over this motion, “Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled 
masses.”  You have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third.  I'd like 
to introduce Kris Kobach, who is secretary of State for the State of Kansas, and who also 

gets around the country quite a bit consulting as a lawyer for other states on immigration 

laws.  He was the co-author of Arizona's controversial SB1070.  [hissing from audience] 

You are also defending laws -- no hissing, please.   

 

19:11:49 

 

You're also defending laws in I believe Missouri, Texas.  Where else? 

 

Kris Kobach:

Nebraska. 

 

John Donvan: 

Nebraska. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Pennsylvania. 

 

John Donvan: 

Pennsylvania.  Now, your -- do people in Kansas think you're not taking this secretary of 

State thing not seriously if you're getting around so much? 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Well, I'm making plenty of noise there too. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay.  I just want to remind you to move a little closer to your mic.  And ladies and 

gentlemen, Kris Kobach. 

 

[applause] 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Thank you.  My work in terms of immigration policy at the national level began in 2001 

when I served as counsel to John Ashcroft at the Justice Department.  And after I left the 

Justice Department in 2003, I left with a very important idea in my head and that was that 

the rule of law has broken down in immigration, and much had to be done to restore it.  

But it had to be done not only at the national level, but also at the state level.  And that's 

why I got involved helping states like Arizona and many other states.   

 

19:12:44 

 

In 2007 for the first time, every state in the country saw legislation introduced into the 

state legislature to, in some way, restrict or slow down the pace of immigration into that 

state.  Not all of them passed, but that's an important point.  Every state is a border state 

now.  The reason that nearly all of the states on the map are trying to take steps to 

discourage illegal immigration is several-fold.  But the number one driver is a very 

important point in this debate, and I'd like to start there.  The fiscal cost, fiscal cost, the 

cost to governments, to taxpayers to the illegal immigration in particular is unsustainable.  

My point can be summarized in one sentence by Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman.  He 

said, it's just obvious. You can't have open immigration and a welfare state.  You can't 

have open immigration and a welfare state.  Now, my guess is that there are a few fans of 

the welfare state here in the audience.  I am not a big fan myself, I accept the reality that 

it's here to stay.  And given that reality, there is an important distinction that needs to be 

made between the current wave of immigration, which started in the '80s and has been 

going unabated for three decades, and all preceding waves of immigration.

19:13:49 

 

They were not immigrating into a welfare state.  They were immigrating into a situation 

where they rose or they fell based on their own merits.  There was no safety net to catch 

them.  That is a critical distinction that changes everything.  When Emma Lazarus wrote 

that poem, she spoke of a lady holding the golden -- the lamp by the golden door.  Now, 

the golden door she was referring to was a golden door of opportunity.  You come here, 

you're free to do whatever you can.  You make it or you lose it, but it's all up to you.  

Now that golden door represents goodies, public benefits, services that are available to 

people who come to the United States more than any other nation in the Western 

hemisphere.  The golden door represents something completely different.  Now, aliens 

are consuming those benefits far more than U.S. citizens are doing so. Now, the average 

per household consumption -- that consumption of public services and benefits, is 

estimated, from a 2007 figure, not 1993 numbers, 2007, to be $19,400 per year net. 

 

19:14:49 

 

They're consuming -- and this is all immigrants, the illegal and legal combined.  19,400 

per year more in services than they're paying it in taxes.  So that's a net drag on the fiscal 

status of the country.  Now, Julián mentioned this 1993 study.  I have not seen that study.  

That is so old I wouldn't even know where to begin because the numbers are so different 

back then.  Now we're talking 11.3 million illegal aliens in the country.  There was also a 

study that came out last month based on census figures from 2010, and the number was 

generated by the Center for Immigration Studies, crunching the numbers, 71 percent of 

illegal alien households are consuming some form of welfare, 52 percent of lawfully 

present alien-headed households are consuming some form of welfare, in contrast to only 

39 percent of the U.S. citizen-headed households are consuming some form of welfare.  

Now, the explanation for this is obvious.  It has nothing to do with ethnicity or 

nationality, it has everything to do with economics and demographics.  Poor people are 

more likely to consume welfare.   

 

19:15:48 

 

And immigrants coming into the United States, especially illegal immigrants, are almost 

in all cases having less than a high school education.  If you look at all immigrants 

combined, about two-thirds have a high school education or less, and so we are importing 

a very impoverished set of immigrants, both legal and illegal, into the country.  Here's 

another fact to chew on.  The Mexico-American border has the greatest disparity in 

income levels of any border on the planet.  There is no other national border where the 

difference between the rich country and the poor country per capita is greater.  That fuels 

a lot of this fiscal cost, too.  So since 1996, Congress has passed laws trying to discourage 

this handing out of public benefits because it exacerbates the problem.  Most states have 

ignored that law.  New York is one of the states that continues to give public benefits to 

illegal aliens.  New York also gives in-state tuition rates to certain illegal aliens.  Think 

about that if you are a --

-- well, I don't think any of the out-of-state students who are at a public institution are 

clapping right now because they're paying out-of-state tuition rates.   

 

19:16:51 

 

Now, the -- nationwide, as Tom mentioned, it's over $100 billion a year net that is 

flowing out to illegal aliens, that is to say, they're consuming that much more in benefits 

than they're paying in taxes.  And the burden falls overwhelmingly at the states.  Indeed, I 

like to say illegal immigration is the ultimate unfunded federal mandate because the 

federal government, which is chiefly responsible for enforcing the laws, fails to do so, 

and then the states have to pay the burden.  You can think of story after story about this.  

Hazelton, Pennsylvania, one of the cities that I'm representing, they saw their population 

explode from 20,000 in the year 2000 to about 30,000 five years later, 50 percent increase 

in population, but they get most of their revenue from an earned income tax and their 

revenue remained flat.  Population goes up 50 percent, no additional tax revenue, that 

was because most of the additional people coming in were working at a meat packing 

plant nearby, were illegal aliens, and they were either earning too little income to pay any 

taxes or they were earning purely cash income.   

 

19:17:51 

 

And the city wasn't getting any revenues.  Look what happened.  All the costs to the city 

went up 50 percent, all the costs contingent on population.  The school districts, the 

budget was breaking, English as a Second Language, the expenditures in 2002 were 

136,000 that year.  In 2006, they went up to 1.1 million.  Talk about that kind of burden 

on a small town school district.  The same thing is happening at the national level.  And 

as a result, we have to recognize that there is a fiscal cost.  Or take it on the individual 

level.  Look at the jobs.  There are 14 million Americans out of work.  A vast majority of 

the 11.3 illegal -- million illegal aliens have those jobs, about seven million are in the 

workforce.  Many states are realizing the simple truth, if you want to create a real job for 

a U.S. citizen tomorrow, deport an illegal alien today.  It actually works. 

 

[applause] 

 

But of course many of you are probably thinking, and I'm sure we'll hear from the other 

side, that those are jobs Americans won't do, that those are jobs that are too low on the 

totem pole for Americans to do.   

 

19:18:51 

 

Well, the statistics don't bear that out because in every single one of the industry -- 

industrial sectors where illegal aliens are prominent, U.S. citizens still have the majority 

of jobs there, 74 percent of construction workers, U.S. citizens, 76 percent of food 

preparation workers, U.S. citizens, 56 percent of agriculture laborers, U.S. citizens.  The 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

U.S. citizens are there, and they're working right alongside the illegal aliens who are 

depressing the wages or taking their jobs outright.  So if we care about our fiscal health, 

and if we care about the Americans who are struggling to put food on the table, we 

should look very seriously at our immigration problem in the United States. 

 

[applause] 

 

John Donvan: 

This is our motion, "Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses."  And now 

here to speak against the motion, Tamar Jacoby, actually had a long career as a journalist, 

was a writer, a justice reporter for Newsweek, then was deputy editor of the op-ed page in 

The New York Times.   

 

19:19:46 

 

And then you went on to write books about immigration, and now you're running an 

organization called "ImmigrationWorks USA," and you're not approaching this from the 

left but you're actually looking at it from the point of the small businessmen whom your 

organization assists and, Tamar, I just want to say I’m very glad to hear about the post-
journalism career success personally. 

 

[laughter] 

 

It’s very heartening. 
 

Tamar Jacoby: 

You too can go into politics. 

 

John Donvan: 

Ladies and gentleman [laughs] ladies and gentleman, Tamar Jacoby. 

 

[applause] 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Thank you so much, and thank you so much to the sponsors of this event.  So, like all of 

us, I’m a descendant of immigrants.  In my case, there were two kinds of immigrants.  On 
one side were the Eastern European Jews, and on the other side were the people who 

came on The Mayflower.  So, I grew up in a house where I had two lessons.  One was 

that difference was really kind of what made us great.  It’s certainly what made the two 
sides of my family great.  And I learned to understand later it was what made the country 

great.  But I also learned that, in many ways, what we have in common -- this was 

another lesson in my household -- what we have in common is more important than our 

differences.   

 

19:20:46 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And so I see the challenge for the country going forward, as it was in my family, is to 

make sure that balance is in the right -- is in balance, that we’re getting the benefits of the 
difference, but we’re also holding together as one country.  And that’s where I start when 
I’m considering immigration.  It’s not -- there have been words thrown around here:  
nostalgia, generosity, I’m not sure anybody mentioned rights, but that’s another way that 
a lot of people come at it.  I don’t come at immigration from any of those perspectives.  I 
come at it from what is in America’s interest.  What’s really good for us, for our 
economy, for our security, and for our future?  And that’s why I’m dead set against this 
motion.  I don’t think it’s good for our economy or for our values.  So let’s start by being 
honest.  Immigration is about economics.  It’s driven by economics, for the people who 
get up in their home villages and come here, and it’s driven by economics for the 
Americans who hire them.  And the bottom line is it turns out to be an economic win-

win.  Immigrants create jobs.   

 

19:21:49 

 

And contrary to what you’ve just heard from Kris Kobach, it’s counterintuitive, I know, 
but you heard me right.  Immigrants create jobs.  It’s easy to see how that works on the 
high end.  The 25 percent of the patents in the United States that are taken out by people 

who are foreign-born, the 25 percent of the doctors in America who are foreign-born, the 

25 percent of the nurses, the half of all of our science and engineering Ph.D.s who are 

foreign-born.  And you heard it from my partner, Julián, the quarter of the tech startups 

that were started by foreign-born.  As in the past, countries competed -- powerful 

countries competed for coal and iron-ore in colonies.  Today, countries around the world 

are competing for high-end engineers and smart immigrants.  But it’s true at the low end, 
too, that immigrants create jobs.  And again, I know this gets even more counterintuitive, 

but, you know, I’ll never forget here -- and this is really what partly brought me to do 
exactly what I’m doing now --  
 

19:22:50 

 

-- hearing the man who ran a seafood processing plant on the Eastern Shore of Maryland 

talk about his company.  He came to the floor of the Senate and he did this.  He talked 

about how he had a 100-year-old family company.  The native born people on the Eastern 

Shore no longer wanted to do the hard seasonal work.  Americans like full -- year-round 

jobs.  No one wanted to do the hard seasonal work of picking the crab out of the shell.  So 

he brought Mexican women every summer to pick those crabs out of the shell -- very 

low-paid, uneducated people, seasonal workers.  You know, that’s the low end of the 
economic totem pole.  But because he had those seasonal workers, he could actually keep 

his company open in a way that he wouldn’t have been able to if he didn’t have them.  
And because he kept his company open, there was a job for the manager in the company 

and the people who packaged the seafood and the accountant in the company.  And 

because he could keep his company open, there was seafood for the restaurants in the 

town where the tourists came to eat seafood.   

 

19:23:48 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 

And because those restaurants and the seafood, hotels, gas stations, insurers, you can get 

the picture -- up and down the food chain, those lowly, lowest bottom-of-the-totem 

seafood pickers were keeping an economy going.  And the point is that on both the top 

and the bottom end of our economy, the bottom of the skill ladder and the top of the skill 

ladder, we have holes that needs filling by a foreign workforce.  The American workforce 

is changing.  We’re getting older.  People are -- we’re having smaller families.  People 
are retiring sooner.  We’ve created -- we have holes at the top and bottom of the 
workforce, and we’re lucky that they’re filled by immigrants who, because they’re 
different from Americans, either more or less skilled, they’re complementary, not 
competitive.  They create jobs for Americans.  Of course, there are costs, and we’ll talk 
more about the costs in this -- I don’t deny there are costs to immigration, but in the long 
run, ultimately, the good far outweighs the bad.   

 

19:24:52 

 

Our need for workers also changes.  That’s not so -- in a bad economy, we need fewer 
foreign workers and in a good economy, we need more.  But ultimately, the point is the 

patents, those PhDs, the startups and the jobs for U.S. workers up and down the food 

chain.  And the 64 million question for me is how are we as a country going to handle 

what I think is a given of the interconnected world.  We're lucky immigrants are coming 

to fill these niches at the top and bottom of our economy.  And how are we going to 

handle it in a way that's consistent with our values, that maximizes the benefits, 

minimizes the cost and is consistent with our values?  And this is really where I differ 

from my opponents in this debate.  I too am for the rule of law.  I too am for security and 

effective enforcement.  But I also think we need to be honest about our needs.   

 

19:25:48 

 

It doesn't really work I don't think to have two signs at the border, one that says,  "Help 

wanted," -- one that says, "Keep Out" and one that says "Help Wanted."  I don't think 

that's an honest standup way to go about our business.  I don't think we want to treat the 

people who come to work for us -- I think we want to treat them in an honest, standup 

way.  We don't want to say, "Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, come on in" when times are 

good and then harass them with policing laws when times are bad to so that they leave.  

Ultimately, that's what I think today's debate is about.  It's about how to do we deal with 

the reality of our economic needs in a way that's consistent with our values?  And if you 

listen tonight, what I think you should be asking yourself is whose way is more likely to 

lead to a successful immigration and successful integration or assimilation?  Is the best 

way accepting reality, allowing people to be here legally, treating them with dignity, or is 

the best way pretending that we don't need these workers, pretending that we can drive 

them out when we can't and driving them further underground?

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Thank you. 

 

[applause] 

 

Tamar Jacoby.  And that concludes round one, opening statements of this “Intelligence 
Squared” debate.  So here's where we are.  We are past opening statements, and we're 
about to go into round two, and that's where the debaters address each other one on one.  

They take questions from me.  And after a little bit, we'll take questions from you as well.  

And I want to, again, urge you, when you're formulating your question, to really think in 

terms of something that's terse and on the point and that really is a question.  So if it has a 

question mark at the end of it that's there appropriately, that's the telltale sign that it's 

functioning as a question.  What I'm trying to discourage is your debating with the 

debaters, but to throw something in here that would actually make them continue to hash 

out the issues.  So I've got to do this part for radio. 

 

19:27:44 

 

And I'll do this from time to time.  I just need to do a little make believe welcome backs 

kind of thing, and we're taking a break, even though we really won't.  So it would be a 

great help to me if you could do a round of applause that -- that will play coming back 

from a break in the radio broadcast, and then I'll start talking.  Thanks very much for 

doing this.  Go ahead. 

 

[applause] 

 

So we are back, and now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly.  

I'm John Donvan of ABC News.  We're at an “Intelligence Squared U.S.” debate at the 
Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.  Our motion is “Don't 
give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.”  We have two teams of two 
members each who have been arguing it out.  The team arguing for the motion says that 

we're working under an out-of-control immigration system where the wrong people are 

getting in the wrong way and exploiting America's generosity, while also, in some cases, 

diluting America's American-ness.  The other side is arguing that immigration may need 

some fixing but that it is vital for the U.S. economy. 

 

19:28:50 

 

And they're also arguing that immigration actually is the American story.  So I'd like to 

go to the side that is arguing for the motion, arguing don't give us your tired, your poor, 

your huddled masses.  And Tom Tancredo, you were talking about the notion that right 

now we're importing poverty.  And I want to ask you, who is welcome?  Who are the 

immigrants that are welcome? 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Well, certainly, you could establish an immigration policy based upon the needs of the 

country in an economic sense.  And that is a determination I think that we have made 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

many times during our past.  Are our needs primarily low-skill, low-wage workers, or are 

they with high skilled.  The people that Tamar and the mayor referred to as being these 

startup companies, these affluent -- or at least people who became affluent, had all these 

skills, great, fine.   

 

19:29:49 

 

It's wonderful.  But I'm telling you that that's not what our immigration policy is today.  

Today it is based almost entirely on something called family unification.  And because 

we've had so many people coming into the country over such a long period of time from 

such low-skilled, low-wage backgrounds that that's who we get. 

 

John Donvan: 

And take 30 -- 15 seconds to describe the dynamic of family unification. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Well, sure.  It's, if you get here, once you get here and get status here, status as someone 

here legally, you can begin the process of bringing in your family, bringing in the 

immediate family then bringing in extended family. 

 

John Donvan: 

And the problem being? 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Being it's coming exactly from the same group of people, the same economic group, 

especially, that is predominantly low-skilled, low-wage workers when we have, right 

now, at least -- by the way, this is also legal -- I'm talking legal immigration. 

 

John Donvan: 

As well. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Let alone the people that are coming across the borders illegally.  Not many of those 

people have these kinds of skills that you're talking about that are so desperately needed. 

 

19:30:45 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay.  Let's do a response from the other side.  Julian Castro is mayor of San Antonio. 

 

Julian Castro: 

Thank you very much.  First, the argument is built on this idea again that immigrants, 

both legal and illegal, are somehow soaking up welfare payments and other state 

subsidies which is not borne out by the evidence.  I would also say that last week, folks 

may have seen this news story.  The Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, reported that 45 

percent of households in this tax year will pay nothing in federal income taxes.  So are we 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

to say then that they have no value either because they're not paying any federal income 

tax. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

It's interesting that you mention that because, of course, when we also start talking about 

the taxes that immigrants and even people who are here illegally pay, there is -- your side 

suggests that they're paying their fair share.  But in reality, they pay nothing in terms of 

income taxes. Most of the people we're talking about end up getting income tax credit 

and therefore money back from the federal government because again, it's low-skilled, 

low-wage work.   

 

19:31:50 

 

And low-skilled, low-wage people don't pay income taxes.  They usually pay -- they pay 

sales taxes and that sort of thing.  But it never balances off with -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Julian Castro. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

-- the costs we incur for the infrastructure we provide. 

 

John Donvan: 

Julian Castro. 

 

Julian Castro: 

Let's just be precise here.  They do pay state income taxes and in some cases federal 

income taxes.  They also pay sales taxes any time they go and buy something.  They pay 

hotel occupancy taxes every time they go to a motel or a hotel.  They pay car rental taxes 

when they rent a car.  They pay all types of fees to the government that help the 

government run and also patronize businesses and spend their money.  And they have a 

tremendous economic impact on every local community. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

They do. 

 

John Donvan: 

Let me ask Kris Kobach -- 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

That is true.  And economic impacts are not positive. 

 

John Donvan: 

Tom, let me bring in your -- let me bring in your partner.  Kris Kobach, I just want -- 

Kris, I just want you to respond to what we just heard because I think that's news to a lot 

of people, a long list of taxes in fact which the immigrants are paying.  True or not? 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 

Kris Kobach: 

It is true that aliens, legal and illegal, of course, pay sales taxes.   

 

19:32:48 

 

They indirectly pay property taxes.  They may pay some income taxes if they're working 

under a false Social Security number.  I'm talking about the illegal aliens here.   

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Which, by the way, they'll never be able to claim. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

But the fiscal impact is undisputed.  Now, there are some economic studies that look at 

the overall impact.  Have we cheapened the price of some goods?  Have we given some 

economic benefits?  But if you narrow it to the fiscal impact, it is undisputed.  Every 

single study in the last 10 years, whether you're talking about Robert Rector's study in 

2007 or the Census Bureau numbers that I related just a moment ago where you have 

seven, eight percent of illegal aliens consuming welfare programs, 51 percent of legal 

aliens and 39 percent of U.S. citizens, which, by the way, matches up well with that 40 

percent figure.  It shows statistically that they are consuming the fiscal benefits.  And if 

you just look at in terms of the benefit to us as taxpayers, we're losing on -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay.  Let's go to Tamar Jacoby, your opponent. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

I mean, again, it all just depends on how you measure it and how you look at it.  If you 

look at it most immigrants pay their taxes to the federal level because they have their 

income tax withheld from their paycheck.   

 

19:33:48 

 

So if you look not just at the state level, but the federal level as well, and you look over 

their whole lifetimes, they actually pay in about as much as they take out because what 

costs is health and education -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Let me finish.  Let me finish.  The cost is health and education.  But then they turn into 

earners and taxpayers.  And so if you look over their whole lives, if you look at the 

federal story as well, it's about an even-even.  Social Security, they pay in every year 

about $7 billion that they don't take out because they pay in on -- illegal immigrants pay 

in on Social Security numbers, and they don't recoup the costs.  So they get to keep the -- 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 

But your opponents have made the case that in other ways that immigrants and illegal 

immigrants especially are drawing on the welfare system. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Well, they're exaggerating their welfare numbers.  But let me just make my -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Male Speaker: 

2010 census. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Let me just make a closing point.  The point is that what you're leaving out is growth, is 

the growth they make possible. 

 

19:34:44 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

And let me just give you a couple numbers.  So in the State of North Carolina, they 

measured over the '90s, what an immigrants -- what was the fiscal cost and what was the 

growth made possible in consumption and adding to businesses.  Fiscal costs over 10 

years, $61 million.  Now, that's real money, that's those costs by Latinos coming to the 

States -- growth, growth, 11 billion -- 

 

John Donvan: 

All right.  Tamar, I -- we see where you're going with the growth [inaudible] -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Growth, 11 billion. 

 

John Donvan: 

-- take it, but I want your opponents to respond to your earlier point. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

That rightwing organization, the National Academy of Sciences, I mean, will you accept 

that as a legitimate entity that assesses these issues?  I mean, it doesn't have -- to the best 

of my knowledge, it doesn't have a dog in this fight, it doesn't have a political bone to 

pick with anybody.  It's the National Academy of Sciences.  You can argue with the -- 

with CIS and other studies, but the National Academy of Sciences shows that you're not 

correct, Tamar, when you suggest that this isn't a fiscal drain on this country.  It most 

certainly is.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Tamar Jacoby: 

That's not what that study found. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

It is also just common sense, it's not even something that you have to go through reams of 

statistical evidence to prove it is common sense.   

 

19:35:51 

 

If you come here without an ability to provide a service that is well paid for you are not 

going to be able to pay the income taxes you're talking about, but you are undeniably 

going to require the services, the services for your children, the children who are in the 

public school system, the services for the -- the social services -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

And I consider educating the workforce of the future -- 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

-- the social service benefits. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

I consider educating the workforce for the future not as a welfare benefit but an 

investment. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Yeah, or in the [spelled phonetically] day today [spelled phonetically]. 

 

[applause] 

 

John Donvan: 

Tamar cedes some time to her colleague, Julian Castro. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Sure, an investment.  Well, okay, how about the investment in our prison system? 

 

John Donvan: 

Tom, Tom, Tom, I want to bring in Julian Castro. 

 

Julian Castro: 

Well, what Congressman Tancredo may remember as well is that in 2006 the Republican 

State Comptroller of Texas did an analysis that said that -- that analyzed how much 

revenue -- state revenue had been generated by illegal immigrants and found it at $1.58 

billion and said that $1.16 billion in state resources had been taken by illegal immigrants, 

and so this idea that it is just is so clear cut across the country, that's not true.

Kris Kobach. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

I [unintelligible] with that study, that Texas Comptroller study looked -- it didn't just look 

at fiscal income and outgo, then they went on and considered, "Well, have there been 

generations in second and third degree effects of extra businesses or extra -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Right. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

-- consumption that might have occurred?"  Now, that's fine, and look, let's get this 

straight, the fiscal debate is clear, they are a fiscal drag.  Now, I will agree that there are -

- we get cheaper vegetables because of this, but you have to realize there are winners and 

there are losers.  The winners are the employers who are able to exploit the illegal labor, 

the losers are the consumer -- the winners are the consumers of some goods who really 

want that extra two pennies off the price of a head of lettuce, but the losers are the U.S. 

citizens who lose their jobs, the U.S. citizens who are still working in those fields and are 

getting paid a lower wage, and the taxpayers.  There's no doubt the taxpayers are the 

losers. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

None of this is true, that no economists -- 

 

[laughter] 

 

-- no economists looking for a wage effect, there’s been people studying it for 20 years, 
even the most -- 

 

19:37:51 

 

Kris Kobach: 

George Borjas -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- yeah -- 

 

Kris Kobach: 

2007. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- has found that over 20 years there's a less than five percent wage effect for the people 

at the very -- for a high school dropout.

Kris Kobach: 

So you can see there is a wage effect. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

And other -- economists challenge him and say -- 

 

[applause] 

 

Kris Kobach: 

I agree. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- it’s less than one percent, and other economists who studied it say that so the division 
is between over 20 years for the -- only the 10 percent of Americans who drop out of high 

school, that for them it’s between one and four, and for everyone else it’s actually gains is 
wages -- 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Can I see if we agree on this point? 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- for everyone else it’s gains in wages because having low skilled people there makes the 
productivity of the higher workers go up. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

So do we agree on -- do we agree on the Borjas numbers?  Says that if you have a 10 

percent increase in the number of laborers in a given industrial sector you will have in the 

short term a decrease in wages of seven to eight percent, and in the long term a decrease 

in wages of three to four percent, in the long term.  So we agree on that, they can decide 

whether that's significant or not. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Three to four, three to four. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

I think that’s significant. 
 

Tamar Jacoby:    

For other high school dropouts. 

 

[applause] 

 

John Donvan:    

Julian Castro, you -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[unintelligible] no, no -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Julián, you heard your opponent.   

 

19:38:48 

 

Moving on to a different part of this argument, and that’s the assimilation argument, your 
opponent's raising the concern that the wave of immigrants that we’re talking about for 
the most part, poor immigrants and illegal immigrants as well, that they’re not coming -- 
they’re not really becoming part of the culture.  They come to dip their toes and to remain 
speaking Spanish and to remain with the dream of going back home ultimately and not 

really buying in.  Can you take that on? 

 

Julian Castro: 

Sure, I’d say first that it’s been a common theme in American history, this impulse to 
believe that anyone who is other than the dominant majority is somehow going to poison 

the culture.  And look at us all these years later as a nation, we are a very strong nation, 

we’re the number one economy in the world.  We’re a nation where folks are learning 
English, where they are participating in democracy.  You know, in my own family, for 

instance, just anecdotally, my grandmother that I grew up with, came to the United States 

when she was very young from Mexico, and tonight I’m speaking perfect English, not 
Spanish, so. 

 

19:39:48 

 

[laughter] 

 

John Donvan:    

By the way, I hear your Spanish is pretty terrible. 

 

[laughter] 

 

Julian Castro:    

My English is about 100 times better than my Spanish, and really the idea is not that, you 

know -- the idea is that you see a common trajectory, no matter whether it’s the Germans 
that Benjamin Franklin was talking about, the Chinese that we tried to exclude, you 

know, the French that we were, we passed the Alien Sedition Act for, or today, the 

Hispanic culture, folks embrace America -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Right, but I think your opponents are arguing it in several ways.  This time it’s different.  
And I want to go back to Tom Tancredo [audio interference].  And why is it different? 

 

Tom Tancredo: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

It would be exactly the same, quite frankly, if the numbers were close.  What I mean by 

that is this -- all during the period of time that we talk about as being the heyday of 

immigration to this country, we of course witnessed exactly what you say in terms of 

people coming here and being, you know, sort of sequestered or put in -- or sequestering 

themselves.   

 

19:40:47 

 

I mean, it didn’t always happen because we forced it that way.  You know, groups settled 
where they were comfortable, settled in what we call ghettos sometimes.  But that’s 
natural.  It’s a natural phenomenon.  They’re going to look for the people that they know, 
the language they understand, the customs and habits that they’re familiar with, perfectly 
natural.  What happened in the past is that the numbers allowed for, and also the timeouts 

that I mentioned earlier, allowed for an assimilation process.  Even if people didn’t want 
to, they were almost forced into it in order to get ahead in the country.  Of course, there 

was the issue of English.  My grandparents, I can remember so distinctly my grandmother 

and grandfather in the back seat of the car, Sunday afternoon drive, after a couple of 

hours, they had been together for probably long enough in close proximity so they started 

to argue about things.  And my grandfather would lapse into Italian and my grandmother 

would yell at him, “Speak American, dammit!”   
 

19:41:45 

 

And it was her purpose, and it -- 

 

John Donvan: 

But why are you saying that’s not happening in the Mexican communities as well? 
 

Tom Tancredo: 

Because the numbers today are so high of people coming from a particular area into a 

geographic area that bring the culture -- 

 

John Donvan: 

You’re saying there’s a critical mass -- you’re saying there’s a critical mass in this case 
that makes it different -- 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

That makes is much more difficult to assimilate. 

 

John Donvan: 

I just want to see what the other side’s response to that. 
 

Tamar Jacoby: 

People in the second generation, even among poor -- children of poor Mexicans, 

everyone learns English.  And the third generation, three-quarters of the people can’t 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

speak Spanish anymore, can’t speak to their grandmother.  People are learning English as 
they did in the past. 

 

Male Speaker: 

No, it’s not, Tamar. 
 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Where I want to shift the conversation is, I believe that the policies of our opposing team 

would actually make integration or assimilation harder, not easier.  They want to keep 

people on the wrong side of the law, not let them make restitution and get right with the 

law and come into society.  They want to end birthright citizenship so that the children of 

immigrants grow up not as citizens, which every study that’s looked at it has shown 
makes the parents less likely to learn the language and integrate. 

 

19:42:49 

 

John Donvan: 

All right, before you go through your list, I’d like to give them a chance to respond.  Kris 
Kobach? 

 

Kris Kobach: 

There are -- obviously, assimilation has occurred and obviously assimilation can occur in 

the future in America.  But assimilation doesn’t happen automatically.  As Tom 
mentioned, you have to have -- there’s a tipping point.  If the percentage of the immigrant 
population is so high and is so disproportionately speaking one language or sharing one 

culture, then the pressure from the rest of us, the rest of the American society, on that 

group to assimilate is lower. 

 

John Donvan: 

Kris, the point that was just made by your -- the point that was just made was, for 

example, a policy that you mentioned before of denying in-state tuition prices to 

immigrants actually acts to stifle assimilation because those are going to be kids who 

won’t be going to school.  
 

Kris Kobach: 

Well, actually, it’s to encourage people to leave and comply with the law and go home.  
That’s the idea. 
[laughter] 

 

Now, but let me -- let me give one more point on assimilation, and that is one of the 

greatest engines of assimilation -- I think we can all agree on this -- is the public schools.   

 

19:43:48 

 

In the past for the last 100 years or so, the public schools have been the primary engine of 

assimilation.  That engine is not working anymore.  According to a study done at a high 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

school in San Diego, I think in 2002 or 2003, after three years of high school, the 

proportion of students self-identifying themselves as Americans went down 50 percent.  

The proportion saying they were hyphenated Americans, in other words, Mexican-

American or something like that, went down 30 percent.  And the number that they were 

saying they are a foreign nationality after three years of high school went up 52 percent. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

And that study was done in the middle of the battle over Prop 187, which was denying 

benefits to immigrants -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Kris Kobach: 

That was in 1994. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- had commercials on TV saying stop them coming -- I know the study you’re talking 
about, Rumbaugh’s [phonetic] study, and what he was showing was that when there’s an 
anti-immigrant climate, people get alienated and identify with their group.  And that’s 
exactly what I would argue your side is creating, is an anti-immigrant climate that drives 

people to identify with their group and not assimilate. 

 

John Donvan: 

Do you see the logic?  I just want to -- I’m not taking sides, but Tamar Jacoby has 
presented a logical explanation there.   

 

19:44:52 

 

I’d just like you to take it on. Tom Tancredo. 
 

Tom Tancredo: 

Sure, the logical argument is this: If people come into this country illegally, especially 

illegally, we should all go, huh, well, you're an immigrant, and therefore we should be 

happy about the fact you're here.  We should not -- we should not raise our concerns 

about it.  We should not say that people should come into the country the legal way.  

There is a door.  180 -- 165,000 people a month come in today still legally.  We are the 

most liberal country in the world regarding to legal immigration.  But the minute we start 

talking about the fact that people are violating American laws to get here, that's all of a 

sudden making it an uncomfortable place for immigrants.  Well, bologna.  I will not 

accept the idea that you can't talk the rule of law and be critical of people coming into 

this country illegally. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

I agree with you that illegal immigration -- I agree with you -- 

 

Tom Tancredo: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

What's wrong with that? 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- that illegal immigration is not what the country wants.   

 

19:45:45 

 

And I agree with you -- 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

But you want to grant an amnesty. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

that we need enforcement of the rule of law.  But the problem is our system makes it hard 

to enter legally, and we don't have enough places for the workers we need.  And then we 

make it easy to enter illegally. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

A million -- a little over a million and a quarter people coming legally every year.  And 

by the way, as you know, Tamar, the number of visas that are allowable for people to 

come here and work in the agricultural arena, H-2A, I believe, are unlimited.  Right there 

you could have 10 million people come tomorrow and on their visas. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

But they don't. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

You don't because -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Donvan: 

I want to bring in -- 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Just a moment. 

 

John Donvan: 

-- Julian Castro has not been heard from for more than four minutes, and I would like to -

- which is rare for a politician. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

You don't have that because -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Tom, let me -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Donvan: 

More than four minutes, and you have. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

All right.  Okay. 

 

Julian Castro: 

Yeah, a few months ago, the census released its 2010 figures.  And I believe that the 

population was somewhere around 308 million.  And the number of illegal immigrants in 

our country has been pegged at 11 million.   

 

19:46:46 

 

Now, you know, almost half of those folks are not Mexicans.  And so this idea that 

somehow one and a half percent of this population of folks who are illegal, or even if you 

take three percent, are going to Balkanize the United States of America is just absolutely 

ridiculous.  In fact, I've seen in San Antonio the effective generations of what has 

happened with the waves of Hispanic immigrants. San Antonio is now the seventh largest 

city in the United States, the second largest city in Texas.  It has a very robust local 

economy, so much so that during these last couple of years [unintelligible] and Forbes 

and others have [unintelligible] ranked it as one of the most successful US cities. 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Donvan: 

But Julián, can you address -- and to a degree, your partner did.  But the numbers that 

your opponent Kris Kobach brought out about the number of kids in public schools who 

are identifying as not American, do you think that's solely down to an anti-immigrant 

climate from the debate, because they obviously don't.  I'd like to see what you think 

about that. 

 

Julian Castro: 

Well, first, I haven't seen that study.   

 

19:47:47 

 

But Secretary Kobach said that that was from a San Diego high school.  The first thing is 

I would question the sample and the breadth of that study.  I don't think that you can draw 

many conclusions from one high school in the United States, one class.  But think about 

your own lives and the folks that you've met here in New York or wherever you've gone.  

Folks are very proud to be Americans.  They came here for a reason.  They came here to 

get ahead.  They come here because of what America stands for.  My experience has been 

that people very much identify themselves and are proud to be Americans.

Just look at the names of the people who are fighting and dying in our wars.  Hispanics 

are a representative proportion to their proportion of the population.  These are 

newcomers, and they're fighting and dying for us. 

 

Kris Kobach:

He says they're not. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Here legally and are U.S. citizens --

Yeah. 

 

Kris Kobach:

John Donvan: 

Kris Kobach. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

The census bureau, the actual number, you’re right, 308 million total people residing in 
America, approximately 36 million are aliens, and that includes legal and illegal.   

 

19:48:48 

 

So it's about 12 percent -- 

 

Julian Castro: 

Well, here you go -- 

 

Kris Kobach: 

-- of the population.  And that is basically -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Julian Castro: 

Kris, I mean, you're switching between legal and illegal and making some arguments 

only for legal.

Kris Kobach:

Julian Castro: 

You can't have it both ways.  That's the point. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

-- million is illegal.  You do the math. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

That is a good question.  Are you guys against just illegal immigration, or are you against 

immigration, period? 

 

Kris Kobach: 

I'm telling you what we are in favor of is increasing the percentage of aliens who are 

exactly the ones you're talking about, the job creators, the entrepreneurs that are starting 

the companies. The way you increase that percentage is you reduce illegal immigration to 

zero, and you change our priorities about legal immigration, and you give higher 

preference to people who are skilled. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

And who -- 

 

Kris Kobach: 

We can accept the cream of the crop, and we should. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

And who's going to grow our food?  And who's going to take care of our old people?  

And who's going to work in hospitals? 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Well, the 14 million unemployed Americans would be a starter. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay.  I'd like to go to questions from the audience.  And the way that this works, the 

lights will come up, and if you raise your hand, I'll find you, and then a microphone will 

be brought to you. 

 

19:49:48

  Arlington, VA 22203 

We'd like you to stand up so that the camera can find you.  Really, if you could keep your 

question to one sentence or two sentences, I mean, try to formulate it -- I'm okay with a 

brief statement of premise, but we would like to keep it terse.  And hold the mic about a 

fist's distance from your mouth.  And this gentleman in the front row in a blue shirt? 

 

Male Speaker: 

Hi.  Yes.  Actually, the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, he's been talking a 

lot about an immigration policy that will allow a lot more individuals to come in from all 

different classes, but that would be focused on having these immigrants come in a little 

bit more quickly, a little bit easier if they would agree to stay in cities that are necessarily 

in decline like Detroit for a period of two to three years, five years.  I'm just curious.  

Does that change any positions on either side?  And could that be a viable plan that could 

maybe bring -- 

 

John Donvan: 

So he’s saying there is a place.  Kris Kobach, do you want to -- 
 

Tom Tancredo: 

Mayor of Detroit has already responded to that, I think. 

 

19:50:47 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Yeah, Mayor Bloomberg, you notice he didn't suggest that the illegal aliens come to any 

particular borough of New York.  And the citizens of Detroit weren't asked whether -- 

you know, they're facing unemployment -- whether they would like a large number of 

unskilled folks to come in and help revive their economy by taking a job they're already -

- 

 

John Donvan: 

Julian Castro.  Okay, Tamar Jacoby then Julián. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

You can make light of this, but I mean, it's true.  Go to any immigrant neighborhood, they 

revitalize the neighborhoods.  They open shops.  They open restaurants.  They've taken 

burnt out neighborhoods across the country and revitalized them on the same way they 

create small businesses, and they're -- and they're consumers.  Yes, I don't know if we 

really want to send them all to Detroit.  But the truth is immigrants bring economic 

vitality, and they create jobs. 

 

John Donvan: 

Julian Castro. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

He's on to something. 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Julian Castro: 

First, as I said earlier, the studies have shown that immigrants as a class have a higher 

rate of founding businesses than native born U.S. votes.   

 

19:51:42 

 

Mayor Bloomberg is correct, and that's why he has made the economic argument very 

powerfully for both more legal immigration and then doing something with the 11 

million folks who are here illegally.  It is not realistic that you're going to deport 11 

million people because it would decimate the American economy and because -- and this 

isn't about dollars and cents, but because these people are human beings.  They're human 

beings. 

 

John Donvan: 

Tom Tancredo, do you want to weigh in on this? 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Yeah.  What our opponents have done here is very skillful, really great at it, and I give 

them credit for setting up all kinds of straw man arguments, you know, that if you are 

opposed to immigration, you don't understand that some people who are coming here are 

patriots and want to be -- well, of course, it's absolutely true.  Nobody's suggesting that 

every single immigrant comes here under that premise.  But the idea that you -- when you 

say you can't deport, I don't have any -- I have never once, in as many millions of words 

as I have expended on this topic, suggested everybody's got to be deported.  All I've ever 

said is, look, all you have to do is obey the law.   

 

19:52:48 

 

All you have to do is restrict the ability of a employer to give a job to somebody who is 

here illegally.  People self-deport when that happens.  It happened in Arizona.  You do 

not have to round people up.  These are all cannards.  These are all things that people on 

the other say to make it look as though we're all people who are just waiting and biding 

our time until we can get these people out of our country.  That's -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Your policy is even worse than deportation. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Why is it hard to suggest that obeying the law would be a good way to deal with -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Tamar Jacoby. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

-- the immigration problem?  How do you -- what's the deal? 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Tamar Jacoby: 

The theory behind this policy -- the theory behind the policy that Tom Tancredo and Kris 

Kobach are advocates for is called attrition through enforcement.  It's, let's make 

immigrants' lives so miserable that they go home of their own accord.  First of all, it 

doesn't work.  Many immigrants who are here, the unauthorized immigrants, are people 

who have been here for five years, 10 years, 20 years, who own homes, who own 

businesses, who are married to legal Americans. They have citizen children.   

 

19:53:47 

 

You might get a few to go home.  But most are not going to go home.  And honestly, I 

don't think that's how we want to deal with this population.  These are people who we 

said, "nudge, nudge, wink, wink, come on in.  Do some work for us.” 
 

Male Speaker: 

Don't say "we." 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

And now we're saying, let's make their lives so miserable that -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Does it work, Kris Kobach? 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- it will drive them home.  I don't think that's the way to deal with that. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Statistically -- statistically, attrition through enforcement works.  And it's basically the 

idea.  It's the same law enforcement approach you have.  You have a section of highway 

95 where there are no police officers patrolling.  You don't say, well, the only options are 

to have an amnesty, i.e., have no speed limit, or to catch 100 percent of the speeders.  No.  

Which would mean to -- 

 

John Donvan: 

But Kris, I don't want our eyes to glaze over with the answer. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Okay. 

 

John Donvan: 

But when you say -- when you say statistically, can you give us a sense of what you 

mean? 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Yeah.  We have the numbers.  Arizona, more than any other state, has tried to encourage 

people to leave.  Give disincentives.  Take away public benefits.  From middle of 2008 to 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

middle of 2009, the overall illegal alien population in the United States dropped seven 

percent. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Arizona -- 

 

Kris Kobach: 

In Arizona, in dropped 18 percent, more than double the national average. 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

But most of them didn't go home. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

The only difference was the enforcement. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

But most of them didn't go home.   

 

19:54:46 

 

They went to other neighboring states right next to -- 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Then why did the Mexican -- why did the Mexicans – why did the Mexican state of 
Sonora…

That [unintelligible] proves their point, though.  You want to get out of Arizona.

Why did president -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- many of these people anymore.  Mexico, they’ve been out of Mexico for 10 or 15 or 
more years, they're married to Americans, they have citizen children, Mexico's not home 

anymore.  They leave and go to Oklahoma.

Female Speaker: 

Good evening, everyone.  I just want to start out quoting another Nobel Laureate, it was 

Elie Wiesel who said in the ’80s, who in documented immigrants gave the slogan, “No 
human being is illegal.”  And I think that's a really brilliant place from which to start 
because sometimes we see that our laws have inhumane consequences.  But my question 

is for Kris Kobach, how do you explain working for a designated hate group, the 

Federation for American Immigration Reform, founded by white nationalist John Tanton, 

who was recently profiled in The New York Times?   

 

19:55:48 

 

How do you explain the hate speech? 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay, I'm -- you two can talk afterwards.  It's not on our -- 

 

[laughter] 

 

-- and I'm not disrespecting the question or its validity or the conversation you two can 

have afterwards, it's not on our topic. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

[inaudible] I'd like to answer one her points, though.  The designation, by the way, is by 

the Southern Poverty Law Center which designates lots of people lots of things, but the 

bit about no human being being illegal, the reason I use the term "illegal alien" or "alien 

unlawfully present in the United States," is those are the terms used by federal law, and 

being a lawyer, I try to use the terms used by law. 

 

[laughter] 

 

The word "undocumented immigrant" does not appear anywhere in the entire United 

States Code. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

[unintelligible] the term "undocumented worker" does not appear. 

 

John Donvan: 

We take the point.

Male Speaker: 

Thank you.  I noticed that Mr. Kobach is a professor of constitutional law, and yet he's 

advocating that states have their own immigration policy.  Do you not understand the 

Constitution you're trying to teach? 

 

19:56:48 

 

[applause] 

 

Kris Kobach: 

I understand that perfectly well.  I understand it perfectly well and -- 

 

John Donvan: 

I'm again close to saying do you want to take this? 

 

Kris Kobach: 

I'd love to take it, because, yeah. 

 

John Donvan: 

I think he does. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Because these questions really are a lot of fun -- I’ve got -- but -- 
 

[laughter] 

 

-- now, let me just -- 

 

John Donvan: 

We've got people here who have committed to really making arguments on the issue. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Let me try to make this interesting because that's what a constitutional law professor 

does. 

 

John Donvan: 

Really fast.

Kris Kobach: 

Really, no, the question -- the doctrine you're talking about is preemption doctrine.  That 

is the idea that some things that Congress can only do and some things that they -- and 

the states can do alongside Congress.  The United States Supreme Court last opined on 

this in 1976 about a California immigration law and said, yes, the states can do things to 

discourage illegal immigration.  There is a case before the United States Supreme Court 

right now, Whiting versus Chamber of Commerce, we should have a decision within the 

next month or so, this will be the first time the Supreme Court has spoken in 35 years.  So 

the precedents are very clearly there, and that's why many of these cases, the states and 

cities are winning. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay, can I ask -- 

 

[applause] 

 

19:57:46 

 

-- just in phrasing the questions to restrain the tendency to want to attack the, you know, 

ad hominem -- 

 

[laughter] 

 

-- please?  Because it -- 

 

Male Speaker: 

[inaudible] 

 

John Donvan: 

I know you can take it but it’s not what we want to do. 
 

Female Speaker:

John Donvan: 

If you stand up.  Oh no, no, no, you've got to get to a microphone first. 

 

Female Speaker: 

Can you hear me? 

 

John Donvan: 

No, no, you get a mic 

. 

[laughter] 

 

Yeah, wow.  Even the radio listeners could hear you on that one.

Female Speaker:    

You have been tossing around this statistic about 11 million immigrants, illegal 

immigrants in this country and then you tossed something in about it dropped, you know, 

so many percentages, what illegal immigrant is telling you that he’s illegal? 
 

[laughter] 

 

And where are these statistics coming from? 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

It's really interesting, the census has what’s called a current population survey and they 
do these every month and they do a really big one in March.  

 

19:58:51 

 

And they actually give them to everybody and illegal aliens answer these surveys.  And 

so they’re based on very large surveys done by the Census Bureau.  And those numbers, 
the 11.3 million, those are generally agreed upon numbers by both the Pew Center and by 

the Center for Immigration Studies so I think there’s broad agreement -- 
 

John Donvan: 

Tamar Jacoby? 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

No, I'm just going to say the same thing. 

 

John Donvan: 

Same thing, you agree on something?  Okay. 

 

[applause] 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Something technical, we agree on something technical. 

 

John Donvan: 

It's very technical.  You have a white collar and I believe gray shirt -- oh, it’s a white 
collared gray shirt. 

 

Male Speaker: 

Earlier the mayor made a point that if you look into the future and you treat not just the 

snapshot of the economy but actually the dynamic picture of the economy, you see 

immigrants not just as one person, but as a pyramid of people who can contribute to the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

economy over many generations.  Why do you folks on the pro side of this question 

always look at the snapshot and never at the long term picture? 

 

19:59:50 

 

John Donvan: 

Interesting question. 

 

Male Speaker:    

Because I think, you know -- 

 

[applause] 

 

-- if many of the people in this room, if our immigrant descendants had come here now 

you would send them home.  But in fact over the many generations we’ve contributed to 
this cause. 

 

John Donvan: 

Tom Tancredo. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

I think I at least attempted to address that when I spoke earlier when I talked about these 

periods of timeout.  In fact, we have had immigrants --  immigration is an important part 

of America.  There is nothing -- there is no argument about that.  It’s just that it was 
rational over American history to create an immigration policy that fit the time, that fit 

the economic situation in the country.  That’s exactly what happened in the 1890s and the 
1900s, massive immigration, low-skilled people.  Fine, worked, it’s okay.  And so you 
can say over a long period of time, it worked.  Well, it would work again today except 

that we have never had this timeout.  And we continue to bring in the same category, 

low-skilled, low-wage worker, even though we don’t have enough jobs. 
 

20:00:54 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay, that’s an argument that has a logic to it, and, sir, I just want to know what your -- 
we need a mic back to you, and briefly, if you can rise again.  Did you hear it? 

 

Male Speaker: 

Yeah, I don’t think that really answers the question.  The question, again, is why are we 
looking only at a snapshot and not at the full intergenerational contribution that 

immigrants and their families make? 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay, he’s really saying why is it -- why are you not saying that 30 years from now, 
those folks that are here now, and you’re saying in an inappropriate time could not 
actually end up contributing.  I think that’s what you’re saying, it’s a dynamic thing. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - 7/8/2014

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

What do we -- 30 years from now, could things be better?  Yeah.  I mean, who’s 
supposed to be able to make that determination?  And why would we begin to think about 

creating -- exacerbating a problem we have today, a massive problem, with 

unemployment in this country -- 10, well, nobody knows the real percentage.   

 

20:01:51 

 

Well, let’s settle on what’s generally talked about as the real unemployment in America, 
at 10 percent -- why would we tell all those people who are unemployed today, that 

they’re going to have to figure out a way to think about their lives as being better in the 
long run because they can’t get a job today. 
 

John Donvan: 

Okay, Tamar Jacoby. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

I mean, it makes no sense. 

 

John Donvan: 

Tamar Jacoby. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

The problem with your arguments -- with our opponents’ arguments about integration 
and assimilation is they’re all based on hypotheticals.  There’s no timeout.  There was a 
timeout in the past.  There’s too much welfare, that we didn’t have so much welfare in 
the past.  But you’re not looking at the empirical evidence of whether today’s immigrants 
are integrating, and they are.  99.9 percent of the children are learning English.  Even in 

the first generation, the home ownership rates and the wealth accumulation rise to 

Americans of similar background.  They’re owning homes.  They’re starting businesses.  
They fighting our wars, and they’re integrating. 
 

John Donvan: 

Okay, I’m hearing from Tom Tancredo.  He’s disagreeing with your points down the line. 
 

Tom Tancredo: 

Almost every single study on this -- this is one of the -- another area where there is some 

degree of agreement in the number of studies out there.   

 

20:02:50 

 

Hispanic immigrants in America -- although Hispanics make economic and educational 

gains from the first to the second generation, not disputed, the progress stops there.  

Third-generation Hispanics still earn significantly less than whites, graduate from college 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

at less than 50 percent of whites, and, by the way, in terms of language, still do not accept 

English as the primary language, even at the third generation. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

That’s just not true. 
 

Julian Castro: 

That’s just not accurate.  Come on. 
 

Tom Tancredo: 

Well, that’s -- okay.  So we have another argument about statistics. 
 

John Donvan: We have an impasse on that.  There’s a -- ma’am in the third row.  Yeah, 
there’s a -- if you look to your left, that mic’s closer.  And if you could stand, thanks. 
 

Female Speaker: 

Hi, I’m -- 
 

John Donvan: 

Could you -- would you mind standing up for the camera?  Thanks so much. 

 

Female Speaker: 

Sorry.  I’m wondering whether the premise should be concentrating on immigrants.  Why 
are we not -- for job losses -- first of all, legal or illegal, why are we not concentrating on 

companies that export the jobs into the third world or the companies like GE that are 

allowed to take their disbursements and costing this country -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay, I -- 

 

20:03:58 

 

Female Speaker: 

No, but it has to do with immigrants because it is not about -- it’s pennywise and pound 
foolish. 

 

John Donvan: 

I agree, I agree.  I agree that there’s a serious tension there, but it’s not going to move our 
discussion along.  But thank you.  I say that respectfully. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Well, but there is actually something to say about this.  Can I just -- can I say something 

to that?  It’s not about -- I’m not going to talk about -- I’m going to talk about 
immigration, I promise you, I promise you. 

 

John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Save it for your closing remarks. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

And for many industries, the choice is actually do we send the jobs abroad or do we have 

the immigrants come here?  For, in agriculture, if immigrants don’t come here, I 
guarantee you, Americans are not going to go out into the fields and pick lettuce and pick 

fruit.  We will start outsourcing -- 

 

Kris Kobach: 

The majority of employees in those fields are Americans right now. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

We will start outsourcing agriculture. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

According to the census, the majority -- 56 percent are Americans in those fields right 

now. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay, so ma’am, you did have a good question.  I acknowledge.  Sir? 
 

20:04:49 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

But they’re supervisors, not the workers. 
 

Male Speaker: 

I don’t see how our latest economic pitfalls of -- with the tours that we’re running and the 
enormous deficit are caused by -- how are the immigrants, illegal or legal are a drag to 

our economy or to causing a drag on our economy? 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Well, see, you heard the numbers, although they're somewhat disputed about the fiscal 

drag.  I think everybody's coming to an agreement, Democratic or Republican alike that 

we have to get a hold of this deficit, $1.4 trillion a year. 

 

Male Speaker: 

[unintelligible] million unemployed caused by the illegal immigrants? 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Well, if we don't create -- if we do not create, in this country, 200,000 jobs a month, that's 

200,000 new jobs every month have to be created in this country by the private sector in 

order for us to climb out of this recession, okay?  Most economists agree that that's the 

number.  We haven't had a 200,000 monthly increase in quite some time.   

 

20:05:46 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 

But we do bring in 160 some thousand a month legally, let alone the numbers that come 

across the border and fly in this country and stay, which is a significant number.  It's not 

just people coming across the border who are illegal aliens in the country.  And so they're 

part of the problem.  Where do those jobs go? 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay.  I'm sorry.  I can't have you debating with him.  But thank you for your question.  

And we're going to take a short break and come back with more of your questions. 

[applause] 

 

John Donvan: 

Welcome back.  Our motion is “Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled 
masses.”  This is a debate from “Intelligence Squared U.S.”  We are in the question-and-
answer section of the debate.  I'm John Donvan of ABC News.  We have two teams of 

two sides each arguing this motion, “Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled 
masses.”  And now to some more questions.  There's a woman, if you did that -- 
 

20:06:46 

 

Female Speaker: 

[inaudible] talk about potential changes to our existing immigration policy, and I wonder 

if the against side would also talk about what changes you would make, because I think 

most people would agree that what we have now doesn't work tremendously well. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

So the key and the most important change -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Tamar Jacoby. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- is that we give the workers who we're going to need in the future a way to come 

legally.  Right now, we don't need that many foreign workers.  We need some in 

agriculture.  And at the high end, we don't need that many.  But in the future when the 

economy picks up, and Americans go back to their better jobs and their year-round jobs, 

and they start to go to restaurants, and they start to go to hotels, and we start to build 

houses again, we're going to need immigrant workers. And on that day, I say we want to 

have them come legally as opposed to illegally.  If our economy needs them, have them 

come legally.  I also think we need enforcement.  Our opponents aren't wrong about 

enforcement.  We do need better enforcement on the border and better enforcement in the 

workplace to make sure -- we need to create legal channels and enforce against the 

people who are coming illegally.   

 

20:07:45 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 45 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And we need some answer for the 11 million people who are already here and are not 

going home no matter how miserable we make them with police stops and other things.  

You know, maybe some of them will go home -- 

 

John Donvan: 

But doesn't your argument for the enforcement that would keep the numbers down fight 

your argument that we need the workers and the -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

No, no.  You need -- the best answer for illegal immigration is a legal immigration 

system that works.  If people are coming to work here, give them a legal way to come and 

then stop the illegals coming -- 

 

Julian Castro: 

I would also just add really, very quickly, that this idea that everybody agrees that they 

broke the law.  But there are a million different ways that people break the law every 

single day of the year.  And for instance, if you break the law, and you're speeding, you 

mentioned speeding earlier, or you're breaking the law because you don't have insurance, 

and you're driving, or you're breaking the law because, for some other reason, one of the 

models that's out there is something called deferred adjudication.  So as a lawyer you 

know, Kris, that basically under deferred adjudication, you still get punished either by 

paying a fine or doing community service. 

 

20:08:48 

 

And as long as you don't commit another crime within a certain amount of time, you're 

able, basically, to wipe that off your record and get on with your life.  That happens 

millions and millions of times.  I would imagine in just about every state in the United 

States. 

 

John Donvan: 

Something like an amnesty. 

 

Julian Castro: 

It's not like the model is not there already. 

 

John Donvan: 

Kris, it is.  Kris Kobach. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Amnesty is a horrible idea for four quick -- for four reasons.  Number one, you're going 

to see that the fiscal impact is going to triple.  The 89.3 -- $89.1 billion a year that we're 

losing fiscally is going to become 2.6 trillion over 10 years.  That was according to the 

Robert Rector study in 2007.  The reason is simple.  Right now, illegal aliens get food 

stamps, Medicaid, free school lunches, K through 12 education.  If they become 

legalized, then they get the big ones.  Then they get Medicare and Social Security.  And 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

the price goes way, way up.  Talk about the golden door.  Number two, it won't just be 

11.3 million.  The last time we had a major amnesty in 1986, according to the INS's own 

records, 398,000 illegal aliens quickly came across the border to falsely claim that they 

were already here and grabbed the amnesty.   

 

20:09:52 

 

Number three, we've been hearing about the terrorists.  We mentioned that earlier about 

the terrorists coming in.  The notion that we are going to suddenly sift through this 

population and know who the terrorists are and who they aren't is demonstrably false.  

Mahmud Abouhalima who was one of the ring leaders in the ’93 attack on the World 
Trade Center here in this city was given amnesty in the 1986 amnesty.  And number four, 

it's a slap in the face to the people -- 

 

Male Speaker: 

Everybody who paid the price -- 

 

Kris Kobach: 

-- who did it the right way. 

 

Male Speaker: 

And did it the right way. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

No one's talking about amnesty.  We're talking about asking people to make restitution 

and get right with the law.  Nobody's talking about amnesty. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

A slap on the wrist, and then you get to stay.  That's called amnesty. 

 

Julian Castro: 

No.  I would say, Kris, that that that's an open question.  In other words, how much are 

you going to punish, just bluntly, how can you punish them for having broken the law?  I 

think that there is room to maneuver among reasonable people there. 

 

John Donvan: 

Third row, beige sweater.  Wait for the mic, okay? 

 

20:10:48 

 

Female Speaker: 

I'm really concerned about the argument, the fiscal argument that this group over here is 

making in regards to the fiscal impact.  When you support the attrition through 

enforcement strategy, that strategy has detained thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of 

people over -- almost 400,000 people were deported last year.  There is about 30,000 

immigrants detained in facilities all across our country that is costing the American 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

people, including immigrants, because they are contributing to the economy and to taxes, 

$1.7 billion.  There's 30,000 -- 

 

John Donvan: 

You're saying there's a cost to enforcement. 

 

Female Speaker: 

There's a cost.  And that's just the detention cost. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay.  Let's let -- 

 

Female Speaker: 

So that has -- and that is also, you know, in terms of our values of being here in the 

United States, what does that speak to to the people who are here, that we -- you know, 

do we want to be viewed as a country that is detaining 30,000 people in detention and 

deporting almost 400,000 people?   

 

20:11:48 

 

I don't think that that's the values that the United States is really portraying across the 

country. 

 

John Donvan: 

Kris Kobach. 

 

Kris Kobach: 

As a lawyer who has worked in this area, you're right.  It's about 30,000 who are 

detained.  Those are people in deportation proceedings.  We call them removal 

proceedings.  But that's a small percentage of the total number of people who are being 

removed from the country at any given time.  And the reason that 30,000 is actually too 

low is that if you do not detain an alien while he is in removal proceedings, and then the 

judge says, at the end of the immigration removal hearing, "You are deported," hands 

him a removal letter, 93 percent will abscond.  They will leave.  They will disobey the 

letter.  And it's known among the immigration attorneys as a run letter.  And so if you 

don't detain, they don't go.  And if we believe that our courts have any meaning, and are 

nothing more than just a laughing stock, we have got to try to detain the ones that present 

the highest risk of leaving -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

But the point is the whole system is broken. 

 

Female Speaker: 

Of people in detention, a lot of these people in detention don't even have an attorney, 

don't have any due process.  And that needs to be addressed.  And do we want -- 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Kris Kobach: 

Okay.  Every immigration hearing has a right to an attorney. 

 

Female Speaker: 

-- as the American public, to be viewed as -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Kris, Kris, I don't want you debating with the audience.   

 

20:12:54 

 

But your passion has been registered and respected.  Sir, on the same aisle to your left.  

Let the mic go back down.  Gentleman in the purple tie.  Oh, it's coming the other way.  

And if you could stand up, sir.  Thanks. 

 

Male Speaker: 

The con side has both been saying there’s not enough legal immigration.  But it's been 
briefly mentioned we do accept 1 million permanent legal immigrants each year and 

about -- and nearly a million temporary workers, and that number has not gone down 

since the recession.  Ms. Jacoby says that you support -- we don't need it now.  So would 

you support a moratorium until the jobs go back up?  And also how many people, 15 

million people apply for the diversity lottery alone.  So how many do you want in the 

country before you -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

So the point is that the market -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Tamar Jacoby. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- works really well to attract people -- when times are good, the market attracts people.   

 

20:13:48 

 

And when times are bad, people get the signal all the way to their villages in Mexico, and 

they don't come.  Since the downturn, half as many people have been coming every year 

from Mexico, half.  People hear that there are no jobs, and so they don't come.  They're 

not coming for welfare.  They're not coming for unemployment.  They don't get those 

things.  They're coming to work.  And that's -- we should be happy about that. 

 

John Donvan: 

That's attrition by bad economy, though. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Exactly.  We should be happy that the market sends the signals.  And the system that -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 

John Donvan: 

Tom Tancredo. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

-- I think we should have is a way for when the market is good and attracting people, 

those people who are coming to work should be able to come legally.  I don't think we 

need people working here and being -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Tom Tancredo. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

Tamar apparently agrees that jobs are the attraction.  Without the jobs, they don't come.  

Without the jobs, they go back.  Therefore, it's an enforcement issue.  Something that's 

called -- right now, it's a program that's voluntary.  It should be mandatory.  It's called E-

Verify, just a requirement that every employer use a process that -- 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

I'm for E-Verify. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

-- actually verifies whether the person is -- has got a good social security number.   

 

20:14:55 

 

Now, can it be -- can there be problems?  Of course.  You can steal the social security.  

But it's a great use of a tool that's out there that would not cost a great deal of money, it's 

an easy process, and it would have the effect if Tamara's right that people won't come if 

they hear there's no jobs, it would have the effect I think also of saying I believe if there 

are no jobs --

Let me just say that I agree that jobs are what drive folks over here.  I disagree with the 

idea that if those jobs aren't there at a given time that they're necessarily just going to go 

back.  You know, the point was made very early that these folks -- let's say that you've 

had a job for 12 years, 13 years, and you've had -- and you're married now and you have 

children who are United States citizens, you know, for the children the United States is 

home.   

 

20:15:47 

 

Mexico or wherever they're from is not home.  And in many ways, Mexico isn't even the 

place that feels like home anymore.  So it's a much more complicated issue than just to 

say if you press this button then this is going to happen. 

 

That's not reality.  That's not [unintelligible]. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay, we have time for one more question that I want to get in, sir, at the far edge, if you 

could stand up. 

 

Male Speaker: 

Hi, this question’s for the pro side, what would you tell to the people like the teenagers, 
the low skilled American worker, people with the minority communities, who are trying 

to get jobs, but yet some of those jobs been taken by illegal immigrants and those are 

those jobs they could have probably had? 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

So I work with seasonal employers.  I just did a survey of a couple hundred of -- actually 

probably up to 500 seasonal employers.  These are like resorts in remote places and fruit 

picking and seasonal work.  And I asked them, are more Americans showing up now in 

the downturn to apply for these jobs?   

 

20:16:43 

 

And what they tell me is in the past, no, Americans showed up to work in a seasonal job 

but, yes, this year a little uptick in the numbers of Americans showing up, but then when 

they learn that it's only a seasonal job and that it's physically -- that it's outside and that 

it's not going to lead to anything, that they're going to have to leave at the end, people are 

not taking those jobs, staying for maybe a few weeks and then leaving.  The Americans 

are not competing with immigrants.  They're mostly doing jobs that Americans do not -- 

are not wanting to do.

Kris Kobach: 

Let's not talk about one anecdote, let's talk about data in whole industries.  There is no 

industry that expresses this more than the meatpacking industry.  The meatpacking 

industry 30 years ago was almost entirely worked by U.S. citizens, the Green Bay 

Packers, a bunch of, you know, whole cities built on meatpacking.  But today, the 

meatpacking industry is about half and half, about half illegal aliens, half U.S. citizens.  

We see exactly what happens when the INS, now ICE goes and shuts down a 

meatpacking company because -- or does a raid, and suddenly 300 employees have gone 

out.  There was a raid in Georgia a few years ago, and they had two to 300 employees 

were arrested.   

 

20:17:51 

 

What happened?  Wages went up.  They had to go up.  They went from $6.75 an hour, 

and then they went up to $7.75 an hour, and what happened was U.S. citizens and legal 

aliens started taking the jobs once the wages got high enough. 

 

Tamar Jacoby:   

But you're leaving out the turnover also went up.   

 

Kris Kobach: 

That’s exactly what has to happen. 
 

Tamar Jacoby: 

The turnover went through the roof because people do the jobs for a little while and then 

they don’t want to do them anymore. 
 

Kris Kobach:    

Twenty years ago, the average wage in meatpacking was about $12 an hour. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

And that's -- 

 

Kris Kobach: 

Now it’s about eight dollars an hour, that’s not in real dollars that’s in absolute dollars.  
There’s no other industry -- 
 

Tamar Jacoby: 

[unintelligible] 

 

John Donvan: 

I have to separate the you because that concludes round two of our debate. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Oh, no.

John Donvan:    

And here’s where we are, we're about to hear brief opening statements -- we're about to 
hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn.  They will be two minutes each, 

and remember how you voted before the debate because immediately after their closing 

statements we’re going to ask you to vote again and the team that has changed the most 
minds according to your votes will be picked -- declared our winner.   

 

20:18:51 

 

So on to round three closing statements by each debater in turn.  Our motion is "Don’t 
give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses," and here to argue against the 

motion, against the don’t, Julian Castro, Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, the seventh 
largest city in the United States. 

 

Julian Castro:    

All right, well thank you very much for giving us this audience this evening.  You've 

heard arguments on both sides tonight.  But I want you to think about at the end of the 

day what the United States of America stands for, what it stood for from its founding and 

what it stands for in this year 2011.  The United States has always stood for opening up 

the doors of opportunity to folks around the world.  And that means that through the 

years there have been many folks who came here legally and there have also been many 

folks who came here illegally.  It is undisputed that folks who are both legal and illegal 

are making an enormous economic contribution to the United States.   

 

20:19:50 

 

In fact, depending on the studies whether it’s a one percent difference or a three percent 
difference, they are contributing in taxes, in creating jobs for others, in economic impact 

in founding companies, and our folks on the other side are trying to have it both ways, to 

say that, yes, throughout history we’ve become the number one economy in the world 
because of all of these immigrants.  And many of them were illegal during that time as 

well.  But something has changed.  We have to change the entire identify of the country.  

I don’t believe that that’s true.  I believe that the evidence bears out that, yes, we can 
strengthen our enforcement, but we need to deal with the 11 million folks who are here 

illegally, punish them for the fact that they broke the law, and then give them a chance at 

the back, at the end of the line, to become citizens eventually, and to deal with the fact 

that the American economy needs these influx of workers.   

 

20:20:47 

 

In 2012, we’ll have the oldest average age for an American worker in our history, 41.6 
years.  We have a declining workforce that must be replenished by immigrants to the

United States.  And there’s no better place to deliver that message than New York City, 
the city of immigrants that has become the greatest city in the world. 

 

John Donvan: 

Thank you, Julian Castro.  Your time is up. 

 

[applause] 

 

Our motion is "Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses."  And here to 

argue for the motion, for the “don’t,” Tom Tancredo, a former Congressman from 
Colorado. 

 

Tom Tancredo: 

I mentioned that I first got into this whole thing because of the intellectual stimulation I 

believe that it provides.  And I think tonight’s a good example, that it certainly does that.  
It is a fascinating discussion, and I sincerely respect the opinions of the people on the 

other side of this.  I would say that there is, for America, I think all of us at this table 

want exactly what has been expressed, Julián, by you, certainly an opportunity for people 

who come here, an opportunity to do great things.   

 

20:21:54 

 

I also want for people who live here, for people who are on the lowest rung of the 

economic ladder in this country to also have an opportunity, to have the ability to actually 

get a job, progress through the system, and especially the ones -- I’m talking about the 
ones that have done it the right way.  Nothing hurts -- there’s no group of people in the 
United States that’s more negatively impacted by massive immigration, both legal and 
illegal, of low-skilled, low-wage people, than the people who are here legally, who are 

low-skilled, low-wage people.  They are our citizens.  Why is it so hard for us to think 

about them, to think about their needs?  For the most part, you know, when we’re talking 
about the immigration process and these people, they came the right way.  And, by the 

way, this has nothing to do with race, ethnicity, absolutely nothing.   

 

20:22:46 

 

I assure you that if Italy was on our southern border, had as much poverty, as much 

population, we would have just as many problems with Italians coming across that border 

illegally.  It’s got nothing to do with ethnicity, nothing.  Although it’s always tried to be -
- people try to cast it in that light because they want to move the discussion away from 

the real problem and to this bogeyman of racism.  Is it out there?  Of course.  But I’ll tell 
you what, it does not motivate me.  All I want is for this country to achieve its goals.  I 

want it to be the place, yeah, that, still, everybody wants to come because we have a 

vibrant economy in which most of the people here are doing well, in fact, all of the 

people are doing well, and this is --

Tom Tancredo: 

Okay. 

 

[applause] 

 

John Donvan: 

Our motion is "Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses."  And here to 

argue against the motion, Tamar Jacoby, who is president and CEO of Immigration 

Works USA. 

 

Tamar Jacoby: 

Well, in conclusion, I would just like to sharpen the choice here a little bit.   

 

20:23:49 

 

I think what you’ve heard is we all agree that the immigration system we have isn’t 
working, but we differ in a very sharp way about what the solution is.  Our opponents say 

that the solution has one dimension.  It’s enforcement and enforcement only.  We say that 
the solution has several dimensions.  Yes, it’s enforcement.  Yes, it’s security.  But it’s 
also a legal immigration system that works.  The best antidote to illegal immigration is a 

legal immigration system that works.  And I urge -- and the other place we disagree is we 

disagree over whether immigration and, really, the economy in America and American 

life is a zero-sum game or not.  Our opponents are saying they have the vision of America 

that leaves no room for people with energy and grit and entrepreneurialism who want to 

come here and make better lives for their families, but also make America a better place.  

They have no room for -- their vision leaves no room for hope and for an expansive 

America.   

 

20:24:49 

 

Their vision is that there’s never enough of anything and that’s it’s a zero-sum game.  
And our point is that that’s just not true in America.  Yes, we’re in a hard time now, but 
that hard time is not going to last forever.  Immigrants don't take jobs.  They create them.  

Immigrants don't threaten us.  They bring talent and vitality.  American culture and 

society haven't lost their appeal.  Immigrants are as drawn to them as ever, and 

immigrants are still integrating or assimilating every bit as fast as they did in the past.  So 

I think the notion is exactly wrong.  Shutting the gates now would be a disastrous policy.  

We need immigrants to create jobs and grow.  And that need's only going to get stronger 

as the economy recovers.  Just saying no isn't an answer.  It's a fantasy, and it's an un-

American fantasy at that.

Thank you, Tamar Jacoby.  Our motion is “Don't give us your tired, your poor, your 
huddled masses.”  And here to argue for the motion, Kris Kobach, Secretary of State of 
Kansas and co-author of Arizona's S.B. 1070, the legal immigration law. 

 

 

20:25:51 

 

Kris Kobach: 

I just want to address a couple of loose ends quickly.  Julián just mentioned this notion 

that if we had an amnesty, it would be just fine.  It'd be fair because the illegal aliens 

would go to the end of the line.  Legally speaking, that's impossible.  When you have an 

amnesty, you immediately give lawful status to the people who are here.  They have been 

automatically given what four to five million people are waiting for who are trying to do 

it the right way.  There is no such thing as the end of the line.  As soon as you grant an 

amnesty, the person is automatically at the front of the line.  And then we heard from 

them earlier that we shouldn't have a policy that fluctuates, encourages immigration some 

years, it discourages it depending on the needs of the U.S. economy.  It should be pretty 

much wide open all the time.  No.  That's exactly what we want.  We want immigration 

policy that is legal and that meets the interests of the United States because we owe our 

highest duty to our own citizens.  And finally, we hear about this point again and again, 

and they're encouraging this myth of belief that there are jobs Americans won't do.  And 

we have to bring them in for the lower end jobs because Americans won't do those jobs.   

 

20:26:52 

 

Now, remember, I told you the statistics.  Americans are doing those jobs.  But there's a 

cultural problem with that argument too.  It's encouraging high school kids today, many 

of whom have never pulled on the starter cord of a Briggs and Stratton lawnmower 

engine, to believe that certain jobs are beneath them.  I would say that is un-American.  

Our country is built on manual labor, everybody going through a period in their life when 

they worked a job like that, and then they moved on.  Well, this attitude of, let the 

immigrants do those jobs is a pernicious attitude in our society.  And so I'll conclude -- 

 

[applause]  

 

-- conclude with this.  Don't give us your tired and your poor because our tired and our 

poor American citizens, who are disproportionately minority and who are out of work 

need those jobs.  They need also the welfare state to survive.  And those things are not 

going to happen if you have a massive amnesty or you have unbridled illegal immigration 

continuing, which an amnesty would further.   

 

20:27:49 

 

So let's look after our own tired and our own poor and then look at immigration in terms 

of what services our national interests.

John Donvan: 

Thank you, Kris Kobach.  And that concludes our closing statements.  And now it's time 

to learn which side you feel argued best.  We're asking you to go again to the key pads to 

the right of your seat and to register your vote.  We will get the readout almost 

immediately.  So our motion is “Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled 
masses.”  And if you agree with this motion, if you agree with don't give us, push number 
one.  If you disagree, push number two.  And if you are -- remain undecided or became 

undecided, push number three.  And it'll lock in.  So we're done with the excitement of 

the evening.  And I just want to say that in an issue that was as contentious as this, I so 

respected how these two teams actually respected the argument and respected each other's 

arguments enough to hear them, and I want to congratulate them all. 

 

 

20:28:50

John Donvan: 

And I personally stood to learn some things from the questioners, including yours, 

ma'am, which I rejected.  Turned out to be a great question.  And as far as your question 

and the argument that you want to have with Kris Kobach, he'll be right there afterwards, 

and he'll be waiting for you.  But thank you, all of you for all of your questions.  They 

really helped the process a great deal.

John Donvan: 

So this spring, our theme has been “America's house divided.”  And tonight's debate was 
the last part of this spring season of our regularly scheduled debates.  But we now are 

happy to announce that we're having a special sixth debate that's going to take place next 

month.  We're just putting it together now.  And it's in partnership with the Film Society 

of Lincoln Center and in conjunction with the opening of the documentary called “Page 
One: A Year Inside the New York Times.”  And the motion that we're going to be 
debating is this:  “The First Amendment does not entitle the press to print state secrets.”   
 

20:29:48 

 

That debate’s going to be taking place here at the Skirball Center on Wednesday, June 
8th.  And we're going to be announcing who our lineup of debaters is quite shortly.  

Tickets are available, though, already at the Skirball box office and also through our Web 

site.  And don't forget, you can follow “Intelligence Squared U.S.” on Twitter.  You can 
see if any of you Tweeted tonight, let's see what you had to say.  And make sure you can

20:30:49 

 

All right.  So it's all -- we've been given the results.  Remember, the team that changes the 

most minds is declared our victor.  Our motion is “Don't give us your tired, your poor, 
your huddled masses.”  Before the debate, 16 percent of you were for the motion, 54 
percent were against, and 30 percent undecided.  After the debate, 35 percent are for the 

motion.  That's up 19 percent.  52 percent are against.  That's down 2 percent.  13 percent 

are undecided.  That means the team arguing for the motion carried the day.  “Don't give 
us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses” has been carried.  Our congratulations to 
that side.  Thanks from me, John Donvan and “Intelligence Squared U.S.”
