Start Time: (18:45:22)  
 
John Donvan: 
So we always start each of our programs by bringing to the stage the chairman of 
Intelligence Squared U.S.  who brought this program to the United States.  He spends a 
couple of minutes kind of outlining why we're doing these debates, what we're looking 
forward to, and always brings a fresh insight to the topic.  So please welcome to the 
stage Mr.  Robert Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Hi, Bob. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Hi, John. 
 
John Donvan: 
How are you?  So, Bob, something that I don't think our audience knows is that you  
actually spent some time as an economist in your career. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 2 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Yeah.  I was an economist at the Rand Corporation back many, many years ago, early in 
my career. 
 
John Donvan: 
So -- so can you help us -- you know, give us an image for -- for -- to hold onto to get  
through tonight's debate. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I think the image is the image of a ladder, climbing the ladder of success in terms 
of one's income.   
 
18:46:21 
 
And the ladder of success has moved over time in a couple of ways.  But the rungs have 
certainly gotten further and further apart so that the very top of the ladder, the top 1 
percent, the top 1/10 of one percent has a much bigger share of the national income 
than it did, say, 20 or 30 years ago.  And the middle rungs of the ladder, frankly haven't 
moved all that much. 
 
John Donvan: 
So this is a very visceral topic.  It's not purely academic.  Why -- why does it connect to 
people so strongly? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I think the -- first of all, before I get to that, let me just say that this debate, in a 
sense, is not about whether the ladder is as I've described it. 
 
18:47:20 
 
But it's about the difficulty or ease of moving from one rung of the ladder to the next 
and getting to the top of that ladder or the upper rungs of the ladder. 
 
John Donvan: 
The mobility question. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
The mobility question.  And this debate is not about anything other than, has this 
increase in inequality, the widening of the rungs of the ladder made it more and more 
difficult for people to climb that ladder, or is it really neutral on -- on that dimension? 
 
John Donvan: 
And again, why -- why does this grab people beyond the academic world? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz:

Well, I think it grabs people because it's been so much in the public consciousness.  And 
I'd say there are really three sort of views out there about what it is that's powered this 
top 1 percent or -- or above.   
 
18:48:15 
 
And one of the views is that it's very benign, that it's a process, a normal process of 
capitalist economies, that you have companies like Apple and Google and Facebook that 
have provided goods and services that we all need, that we all use.  And the 
extraordinarily creative entrepreneurs behind those companies have been very richly 
rewarded, and there's nothing wrong with that.  So that's kind of one mindset.  Another 
mindset is that a lot of it is luck.  And the kind of luck people are talking about is the luck 
of where you're born, the luck of how your -- your parents' economic situation, the luck 
of your race and ethnicity, the luck of how many IQ points you've got, frankly.  So 
there's some -- some people who feel like the primary determinant of where you are on 
that ladder is luck.  And there are other people who take a more draconian view that 
people have gotten to the top of the ladder in mean -- through means that are not 
legitimate.   
 
18:49:23 
 
Crony capitalism, where they've gotten the government to subsidize their particular 
business or activity, are protected with tariffs, or in the case of the big bankers who got 
huge bonuses and then had to be bailed out by the taxpayer. 
 
John Donvan: 
And got bailed out. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
And did get bailed out.  So you -- you have three very different and competing visions of 
-- of what it is that propelled people to the top of that ladder and therefore different 
visions of the legitimacy of the system. 
 
John Donvan: 
So, I mean, -- and there's also just the fact that all of us have a place on the ladder.  I 
mean, on this stage, there are two guys, and one of them is higher up the ladder than 
the other one.  How's the view from up there, Bob? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, you know, John, I thought I'd wear faded jeans and a T-shirt and try to disguise 
that, but then I thought, why not be honest and wear my English suit?

Well, you look very smart.   
 
18:50:23 
 
And let's thank Bob Rosenkranz on the stage.  And let's bring out -- 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's bring out our smart debaters.  Let's welcome them to the stage.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, our debaters.

John Donvan: 
And I just want to invite one more round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz for making all 
this possible. 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Hello again from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan.  We use the word "dream" 
sometimes to mean almost completely opposite things.  We use "dream" to describe an 
aspiration for something that can be if we try hard enough, "Dream a little dream," "I 
have a dream." 
 
18:51:23 
 
But we also use it in the opposite way to describe something that just is so impossible to 
get that it's ridiculous to try.  You know, "Dream on, buddy," "dream on," "in your 
dreams."  So, what about people who are partway down the ladder of success in 
America and their American dream?  Given that 40 percent of America's wealth, up to 
40 percent, and up to 20 percent of its income is in the hands of the legendary 1 
percent, does the dreamer on the ladder still have a chance to climb or should he or she 
simply dream on?  Well, that sounds like the makings of a debate, so let's have it, yes or 
no to this statement, "Income inequality impairs the American dream of upward 
mobility," a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan.  We are at the 
Kaufman Music Center in New York City.  We have four superbly qualified debaters, two 
against two, who will argue for and against this motion, "Income inequality impairs the 
American dream of upward mobility."

As always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then the live audience here in New 
York will vote to choose the winner, and only one side wins.  Our motion, again, 
"Income inequality impairs the American dream of upward mobility."  Let's meet our 
debaters.  Please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome Elise Gould. 
 
[applause] 
 
And, Elise, you're a senior economist and director of health policy research at the 
Economic Policy Institute.  And one of the topics you study there is wages.  And you 
have a calculator on your website, I'm told about -- I haven't been to it yet -- but it 
shows what your wages would be today if they had actually kept up with productivity, 
so that $40,000 today really should be something closer to $60,000.  Thatâ€™s about right? 
 
Elise Gould: 
Yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
So when that was posted on the website, did everybody at the institute ask for a raise? 
 
18:53:20 
 
[laughter] 
 
Elise Gould: 
Well, not immediately, John, but we economists really know how to bring the facts to 
the table when we start bargaining over wages. 
 
John Donvan: 
And you'll be bringing some facts tonight. 
 
Elise Gould: 
Yes, absolutely. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Elise Gould. 
 
[applause] 
 
Can I just ask to have my IFB be lowered significantly?  Thanks.  That's a technical term.  
It's on a need to know basis. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Don't worry, I am not going to explode, I don't think.  Elise, tell us who your partner is.

Elise Gould: 
My partner is the charming and resourceful Nick Hanauer. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Nick Hanauer, please welcome him.  Nick, you are also arguing 
for the motion, "Income inequality impairs the American dream of upward mobility." 
You are a -- let's just say it -- you are clearly a 1 percenter.  You're a venture capitalist.  
Way back in the '90s you made an investment in a little company called Amazon.com.  It 
worked out. 
 
18:54:20 
 
[laughter] 
 
You recently wrote a memo to, as you put it, your "fellow zillionaires," where you 
warned them that these high and historically high inequality is not only self-defeating, 
that it's transforming us into a feudal society.  How did your fellow zillionaires respond 
to that? 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
[laughs] Well, I live in Seattle, Washington, and I reckon you have to go all the way to 
Texas to find a serious and intelligent wealthy person who doesn't agree that rising 
inequality is something that we need to -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- that we need to address. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah, [unintelligible]. 
 
[applause] 
 
Thank you, Nick Hanauer.  That's our team arguing for the motion, ladies and 
gentlemen.

And we have two debaters arguing against the motion, which, once again, is "Income 
inequality impairs the American dream of upward mobility."  Please welcome Ed 
Conard.

Ed, you are a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, former partner at Bain 
Capital.  That makes you also a 1 percenter.  You -- author of this book, "Unintended 
Consequences, Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy is Wrong," in 
which you actually explain how society benefits from the wealthy.  Ahead of publication 
on this, you were profiled in the New York Times.  And you predicted -- I mean, the 
article predicted that this could be the most hated book of the year. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Was it, Ed Conard? 
 
Edward Conard: 
Only in my wildest dreams do I have that much impact on the national debate. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well --

And, Ed, your partner is?

Scott, as your partner just said, you're also arguing against the motion that "Income

you're at the Manhattan Institute, and a -- you know, a relatively conservative think 
tank, but you were once part of ACORN, the liberal community-organizing group.  And

you're editor -- managing editor of the Democratic Strategist.  So, being at the 
Manhattan Institute now, with that background, how -- how do you describe yourself? 
 
Scott Winship: 
I suppose I'm a Liberal-tarian.

I donâ€™t know, my mom describes me as handsome.

John Donvan: 
Well -- just to tell the radio audience, it's entirely true.

Scott Winship, ladies and gentlemen.  And our team arguing against the motion.  Now, 
to remind you, this is a debate.  It's a contest.  One team will win and one team will lose. 
 
18:57:21 
 
And that decision will be made by our live audience here in New York.  By the time the 
audience -- by the time the debaters have completed debating, this audience will have 
voted twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate.  And the way we 
determine victory is the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point 
terms between the two debates, between the two votes.  So, let's have you go to the 
keypads at your seat and register your first vote.  Once again, our motion is this: Income 
Inequality Impairs the American Dream of Upward Mobility.  If you agree with this 
motion, push #1.  If you disagree with this motion, push #2.  Or if you're undecided -- 
which is a perfectly reasonable starting position -- push #3.  You can ignore the other 
keys.  They are not live tonight.  And if you make a mistake in your vote, you can just 
correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote. 
 
18:58:15 
 
Okay.  It looks like everybody's got that done.  And to remind you, we'll have you vote 
again right after you hear the -- the closing round of the debate, and again, to remind 
you that it's the team whose numbers have changed the most between the two votes 
that will be declared our winner.  So, we go in three rounds.  And let's get on to Round 
1.  Our motion is this: Income Inequality Impairs the American Dream of Upward 
Mobility.  And here to speak first for the motion, Elise Gould.  She is Senior Economist 
and Director of Health Policy at the Economic Policy Institute, one of the top -- oh, I've 
already said all of that.

You can say it again. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
I -- I may well end up saying it all again, but I just want to be briefer this time.  But you 
are very, very generous to give me that opportunity.  Elise Gould is a Senior Economist 
and Director of Health Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, Elise Gould. 
 
18:59:21 
 
[applause] 
 
Elise Gould: 
Thank you so much for inviting me to share my research and knowledge about the 
question at hand.  We are debating whether income inequality hampers the American 
dream of upward mobility.  And I'm here to tell you that it does.  Nick Hanauer and I 
hope to convince you that as income inequality has increased, the American Dream has 
been harder to achieve.  If we think -- as you've already heard already, the same analogy 
-- if we think of income distribution as rungs on the ladder, and upward mobility -- or 
mobility in general -- is movements up and down the ladder, common sense tells you if 
the rungs get further apart, the ladder is going to be harder to climb.  Let's start with the 
first part of the proposition.  Research from a multitude of government and academic 
sources have indisputably found that income inequality has increased over the last 
generation.  That is an established fact.   
 
19:00:18 
 
The tremendous growth in income inequality comes at a cost to individuals, to families, 
and to society as a whole.  We know from research that rising income inequality has not 
helped grow the size of the economy, and has likely even harmed growth.  This makes 
the rise in inequality a zero sum game at best.  Since inequality means that the larger 
shares are flowing to the top, middle, and bottom -- the middle and bottom continue to 
get squeezed.  Those consequences aside, the one cost we're discussing today is 
reduced access to the American Dream.  The American Dream itself is a somewhat 
elusive concept.  It's one of those you know it when you see it sort of things.  To some it 
means the happiness of a normal, stable life.  Not falling behind every year.  It means a 
good job and a great future for your children.  It means that if your kids work hard, they 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

will find success.  Working hard is the backbone of the American Dream.  To know that 
your kids have the opportunity to do well, it is only for them to grab it, to seize the day. 
 
19:01:22 
 
The most common concept economists use to measure upward mobility is 
intergenerational mobility.  This is the extent to which your parents' economic position 
determines your position in adulthood.  If your position on the earnings, income, or 
wealth scale is largely a function of your birth, then even the most talented coming from 
the lower rungs of society will have a hard time achieving success.  Conversely, little 
correlation between parents and children means that one's economic fate can be 
directly determined through intelligence and hard work.  So how do we raise the 
economic mobility of the U.S.  today?  Well, one way is to look at how we compare to 
other countries.  Another way is to look at, historically, what has happened with 
mobility and discuss the pathways through which mobility is affected by opportunity.  
The fact that one's economic position in childhood determines one's position in 
adulthood more so in the U.S.  than in many advanced countries.  We have less mobility 
here than in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden.   
 
19:02:23 
 
We have less mobility than Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Germany, Spain, France.  Let 
me talk for a moment about our peer to the north, Canada.  Canada actually looks a lot 
like us, both in economic regime and in its diversity.  But family background is twice as 
important in determining children's success in the U.S.  than in Canada.  Furthermore, 
among our peers, we are the most unequal society, and we have seen the greatest 
growth in inequality.  Janet Yellen recently reiterated the fact that lower economic 
mobility is found in countries with higher income inequality.  So, the American dream is 
more likely elsewhere than here and more likely in more unequal societies.  Now, what's 
happened over time?  The truth is that research on mobility has a few years before it 
can catch up to answer more definitively on this question.  We have to wait until the 
children born in the most unequal times, let's say the last decade, until they grow up, 
and we can see, we can measure their incomes and their earnings.   
 
19:03:23 
 
So far, high quality research has shown that economic mobility has been stagnant or 
declining over the last generation.  Even so, it's impossible to know what the counter 
factual is.  Perhaps the society got richer, economic mobility would have increased.  So, 
finding stagnant mobility really doesn't answer the question.  What is entirely clear and 
is known that income inequality leads to inequality of opportunity and resources, and 
this surely hampers mobility.  When growing inequality means that poor kids don't get 
the proper nutrition they need or the glasses when they need them, then it's obvious 
they can't do as well in school.  Opportunity for many often looks like education.  Over 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

time, high-income parents are -- are making increasingly larger and larger investments 
in their children.  And that's a good thing.  But lower income families simply cannot 
afford to make those same investments.   
 
19:04:18 
 
We've seen low income families increasing their investments from the 1970s to the 
2000s, from about $835 per kid to about $1,300.  At the same time, over that same 
period, high income families' investments went from 3,500 to nearly $9,000.  And those 
investments pay off.  It may come as no surprise that more affluent students score 
better on standardized tests.  A recent study actually renamed the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test the Student Affluent Test.  Those with higher family income who tend to be college 
educated allow parents to live in neighborhoods with better schools and pay for private 
schools.  And it's a self-reinforcing cycle.  This provides a direct link between growing 
inequality, growing gaps in opportunity and declining mobility.  Over this period of 
growing income inequality, college graduation rates have become increasingly unequal.  
Both groups, the top and the bottom, have seen higher college graduation rates than 
before.  But the bottom only increased by 4 percent while the top increased by almost 
20 percentage points. 
 
19:05:20 
 
What is even more troubling for society that defends the reality of the American dream 
is that low-scoring, high-income students are more likely to graduate from college than 
high-scoring, low-income students.  That is, by definition, not about ability.  It is about 
income.  Everyone can't be in the top 1 percent.  And we can all name stories of children 
who did succeed against all odds.  But it's "against the all odds" part that we're here to 
talk about today.  Has living in an increasingly unequal society made it harder to climb 
the rungs of the ladder?  Unambiguously, the answer is yes.

Thank you, Elise Gould.

Scott Winship: 
Well, thank you, John, and thanks to IQ Squared and to the Rosenkranz Foundation for 
sponsoring this debate, but also for creating a way to combat the polarization that I 
think itâ€™s really been poisoning a lot of our discourse the last few years.  And in that 
spirit, let me just start by noting a few areas where there's agreement I think with what 
Elise just said.  First, I agree that there is a lot of income inequality in the United States.  
There's -- frankly, there's a lot of income inequality on this stage. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Like Elise, I'm also deeply concerned about inequality of opportunity.  I can tell you that I 
became interested in these issues on April 29th, 1992 when the L.A.  riots erupted 
during my freshman year of college.  I believed then and still believe that -- that poor 
children enjoy far too little upward mobility.  What do I mean by that?   
 
19:07:22 
 
Kids with the poorest parents tend, disproportionately, to end up among the poorest 
adults as well.  Where I part ways with my opponents, and by the way, with my 19-year-
old self, is that after a brief career in community organizing, after a not at all brief 
period in getting my PhD in Harvard's Inequality and Social Policy program, after 
managing the research agenda for the Pew Economic Mobility Project and continuing to 
study these issues at Brookings and now at the Manhattan Institute, after all of this, I -- 
I've concluded that if you're, like me, concerned about inequality of opportunity, 
focusing on inequality of incomes is just misguided.  So, my partner, Ed, and I are asking 
you to oppose the motion on the table.  Whatever you think of the state of the 
American dream, income inequality does not impair it.  Okay.  So, Elise and I are going to 
disagree on a few things.   
 
19:08:18 
 
In my mind, if -- if income inequality were impairing the American dream of upward 
mobility, you ought to see two things jump out at you in the very big literature that 
we've got on this question.  The first thing you would expect to see is that over the 
period where inequality was growing in the United States, that you would see falling 
upward mobility.  Now, the -- the consensus from a dozen studies on this question is 
easily summarized by the conclusion from the most recent paper that came to this 
conclusion.  And I'll just quote: It found that mobility has remained remarkably stable 
over the second half of the 20th century in the United States.  That finding is from 
Berkeley's Emmanuel Saez who, along with Thomas Piketty, who's the most famous 
economist of the year for sure.  They're the two who develops the top 1 percent 
estimates that we all have seen everywhere.  So, that's his conclusion.  The second 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

conclusion you would expect to see is, if high inequality impairs upward mobility, is that 
places with a lot of inequality would have lower mobility. 
 
19:09:25 
 
And you heard Elise mention that the U.S.  has less mobility than other countries.  That 
was certainly the conventional wisdom I would argue until this year.  In a paper 
published this year, a Canadian economist named Miles Corak, who had originated this 
thing called "The Great Gatsby Curve," that some of you might have heard of, that Janet 
Yellen talked about in her speech. Earlier this year, his most recent paper highlights real 
serious problems with that chart and the previous research.  What he did in this newest 
paper is to team up with an American economist and a Swedish economist.  And the 
three of them looked at their own countries, compared mobility across them, were very 
careful to measure them comparably, and they found, quote, "we find almost no 
differences in upward mobility between Canada, Sweden and the United States."  
 
19:10:14 
 
Meanwhile, Saezâ€™s team, in a second study this past year, found that developed 
countries with higher income concentration have mobility rates that are no lower than 
countries that are low inequality.  And they found the same thing to be true of American 
counties.  Okay.  My opponents want you to believe that if the top 1 percent hadn't 
made as much in the past 35 years, that the bottom and the middle would have made 
more, that they pay an inequality tax you sometimes hear.  But research again finds that 
in rich countries, those that experience bigger increases in inequality, have experienced 
bigger income gains at the bottom and in the middle, not smaller.  Now, how can that 
be?  Well, Ed is going to talk to you about the research on inequality and economic 
growth.  We disagree, I think, with our opponents on that as well.  But essentially, the 
research finds that countries with more inequality actually experience more economic 
growth.  So, essentially if you enlarge the pie enough, the economic pie enough, then 
the poor and middle class actually can get more pie even if their slice becomes skinnier. 
 
19:11:19 
 
If you claim that absent rising inequality, the middle class would have had thousands of 
dollars more than they did, as you sometimes hear, there are a couple of really big 
assumptions hidden behind that.  One is that if we had capped the incomes at the top, 
that the economic pie would have become just as big as it actually did.  The second 
assumption is that if we had capped those incomes, then essentially the proceeds would 
be equally distributed across the population.  Now, in actuality, if we somehow 
managed to cap the incomes of the top 1 percent, what would likely happen is we'd be 
shifting incomes to knowledge workers and professionals who are in the upper middle 
class or in the rest of the top 10 percent.

19:12:22 
 
To see how important these assumptions actually are, consider one possible outcome if 
we had successfully held the top 1 percentâ€™s income share in 2007 to their 1979 level, 
okay?  So assume, for sake of argument, that, that would have reduced economic 
growth, not by a lot, say, by 8 percent.  And assume that the middle 20 percent, instead 
of receiving 20 percent of the proceeds from this redistribution, got 13 percent of the 
proceeds.  Well, I've done the math, and what it works out to is that in this scenario the 
middle class actually would be no better off for having limited the increases at the top.  
So, I think that's against our intuition.  But it's, nevertheless, the case.  So, as you listen 
to the arguments from the other side, I hope you continue to ask yourself, as I have, 
that if income inequality hurts opportunity, why is it so hard to find that link when you 
look across time and look over space?   
 
19:13:25 
 
 The answer is that the motion on the table that "Income inequality impairs the 
American dream of upward mobility," is intuitive but wrong.  And that's why you should 
vote against it.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Scott Winship.

And a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through this opening round of this  
Intelligence Squared U.S.  debate.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four debaters, two teams 
of two, fighting it out over this motion, "Income inequality impairs the American dream 
of upward mobility."  You have heard from the first two debaters, and now on to the 
third.  I'd like to welcome to the lectern Nick Hanauer.  He is a cofounder and partner at 
the venture capital firm, Second Avenue Partners, and author of the book, "The Gardens 
of Democracy."  Ladies and gentlemen, Nick Hanauer. 
 
[applause] 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
Let me start tonight by sharing some IRS data. 
 
19:14:21 
 
 In 1980, the top 1 percent of Americans shared 8.46 percent of national income.  By 
2007, it had risen to 22.86 percent.  During the same time, the bottom 50 percent of 
Americans' share of national income fell from 17.68 percent to 12.19.  During the same 
period, the income share of the top 1/10th of 1 percent of Americans rose to 12 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - 10/23/2014

  Arlington, VA 22203 

percent, equaling the share of the bottom 50 percent of Americans combined.  And then 
in 2008 -- remember, 2007, before, those were the good old days -- things went really 
bad for the American middle class.  The distance an American child needs to go to get 
from the bottom to the top in our society is staggering. CEOs used to make 30 times the 
median wage now earn 300 to 500 times.   
 
19:15:19  
 
If the IRS data that I just quoted you is not persuasive to you, does not persuade you 
that the distance from the top to the bottom is larger -- perhaps 10 times larger, then 
almost nothing Elise and I can say tonight will persuade you.  According to Scott, this 
economic inequality and its impact on mobility is a fiction.  The anguish felt by millions 
of ordinary working middle class Americans is a consequence of a misconception.  They 
are simply confused about the data.  Perhaps.  But there are two fundamentally 
different arguments inequality deniers make.  The first is that it doesn't exist.  The 
second is that it exists but it's actually really, really good for the economy and the 
middle class.  This argument is equally false, but at least it seems plausible.  The idea, of 
course, is that when the rich get richer, that's good for the economy and for the middle 
class, and for mobility.   
 
19:16:24 
 
And anything we do to make the poor richer by definition harms the economy and 
mobility.  And this, of course, is the trickledown economics lie.  But Ed -- Ed and I do 
agree on one thing, and that is that innovation is essential to a growing economy and 
that capitalism needs some inequality to create incentives for people to innovate and to 
take risk.  The question for the house tonight is, is extreme inequality necessary, and 
should we have more and more of it every year?  Capitalism needs inequality to grow, 
just like plants need water to grow. But in precisely the same way that too much water 
kills plants by drowning them, too much income inequality kills capitalism by drowning 
the middle class.  Raging inequality is drowning the middle class and killing the American 
Dream of upward mobility.   
 
19:17:20  
 
Ed and other inequality apologists present us with a false choice -- extreme and rising 
inequality is necessary to create adequate incentives for innovation and risk-taking, and 
that without these extreme incentives, it will all disappear.  He will tell you that anything 
we do to blunt inequality, like raising the taxes on the rich or improving labor standards 
for the poor, to increase wages -- will kill the economy and mobility.  This is utter 
nonsense.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Sam Walton -- they all started their companies when 
taxes were twice as high as they are today.  Theoretically, with half the incentive.  Did 
they make some sort of cosmic mistake?  Almost two years ago, taxes on capital gains 
went up 25 percent, theoretically quartering the incentive.  But from where I sit as a

technology venture capitalist on the West Coast, the rate of innovation is increasing, not 
decreasing. 
 
19:18:22 
 
Silicon Valley is more on fire, not less.  The stock market, since then, has gone from 
12,000 to almost 17,000.  Clearly, people are responding to incentives, just not the ones 
Ed thinks.  The biggest incentive in a market economy is the market size.  And the more 
money most people have -- in other words, the less inequality we have -- the bigger the 
opportunity and the bigger the incentives are to invest and innovate.  Ed will tell you 
that the American economy has outperformed all others because of our extreme 
inequality.  If you are a partner at Bain or someone like me, that feels like it could be 
true, but it is not on a per capita basis.  Our economy has performed roughly the same, 
on a growth basis, as most other industrial countries.  1.7 to 1.9 percent.  The 
difference, of course, is what life is like for the typical family.   
 
19:19:21  
 
Thirty years ago, the American middle class was undisputedly the most prosperous and 
mobile of any society.  Today, that is not true.  Today, by every measure, the -- the 
Canadian middle class is more prosperous than ours.  Ed and his trickle down ilk believe 
that capital is all that matters, but we are awash in capital.  American companies are 
currently sitting on $2 trillion worth of cash.  At the same time, the cost to innovate has 
fallen exponentially.  It took a million dollars to start Amazon.com.  In our economy, 
growth is dependent on how many innovators and consumers we include in the 
economy.  The economy isn't the bank accounts of the rich.  It is the dynamic feedback 
loop between sellers and buyers.   
 
19:20:15  
 
This means that the more people we include in our economy as robust innovators and 
affluent consumers, the faster it grows and the bigger it gets.  But clearly and most 
obviously, high and growing rates of inequality don't help that.  They hinder it by 
excluding more and more people as sellers and buyers.  And at the end of the day, that's 
why rising inequality is terrible for the economy and for the American Dream of upward 
mobility.  When people are excluded by inequality, it destroys innovation.  It destroys 
consumption.  And it destroys mobility.  Rising inequality is literally drowning the middle 
class and killing the American Dream of upward mobility.  Thank you.   
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Nick Hanauer.  And that is our motion: Income Inequality Impairs the 
American Dream of Upward Mobility.

And here as our final debater against the motion, in this opening round, to argue against 
it, Ed Conard.  He is author of the book "Unintended Consequences: Why Everything 
You've Been Told About the Economy is Wrong." And he's a former partner at Bain 
Capital.  Ladies and gentlemen, Ed Conard. 
 
[applause] 
 
Edward Conard: 
I almost feel like I don't have to speak.  Nick said it all for me.   
 
[laughter] 
 
But Nick pushes you off what this debate is really about.  It's whether income inequality 
impairs mobility.  And if it did, there'd be telltale signs that Nick wants to overlook.  The 
first is that we've seen a lot of growing inequality.  But all the evidence says mobility has 
not declined.  Weâ€™ve transferred more to the poor.  That should increase mobility.  It 
hasn't.  Economies with more equally distributed incomes should have more mobility.  
They don't.  We've spent more on education.  That should significantly increase our test 
scores.  It hasn't.  So -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Can I interrupt you just for the radio.  Can you stand with -- with sort of right up to the 
mic because -- 
 
Edward Conard: 
Closer?

Yeah.

All right.

John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Okay.  So, just proceed so that it's a cleaner signal.  Thank you. 
 
Edward Conard: 
I thought it was -- I thought it was a little loud so, I was backing up. 
 
John Donvan: 
And fortunately, we're using up all of your time.  It counts against you this whole 
conversation, so -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Edward Conard: 
[unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, I can â€“ I see whatâ€™s happened with the clock.  We stopped it, and you will get your 
full allotment.  You're on. 
 
Edward Conard: 
Okay.  So we may not have found a way to increase mobility, but we have found a way 
to increase the living standards of the poor, and that's by growing our economy.  So this 
debate really isn't about whether income inequality impairs mobility.  Even Emmanuel 
Saez of the liberal Piketty-Saez duo admits that the chances of a low-income child 
reaching any higher level of income has increased.  The rungs have gotten wider.  You 
can still climb the rungs even though they're wild -- wider.  This debate is really about 
whether the success of America's top earners hurts the middle and working class.  Now, 
our opponents see the pie, the economy as a pie to be divided.  They believe that Steve 
Jobs' success reduces the income of everybody else.   
 
19:23:21 
 
The more he gets, the less everybody else gets.  We see his success as growing the 
economy and the demand for labor.  Now, it's true, productivity's grown faster than 
median wages.  Our opponents see this as evidence that lesser skilled employees no 
longer share in the success of our economy.  They overlook the fact that growth can 
manifest itself in two ways:  Where the supply of labor is restricted like it was in the 
1950s and '60s, it'll drive up wages.  But where the supply of labor is unrestricted like it 
is today, it'll drive up employment.  The baby boom, the increased participation of 
women in the work force, immigration and growing trade deficits have created an 
enormous increase in supply in labor.  And as a result, employment grew instead of 
wages.  U.S.  employment has grown 50 percent since 1980, twice as fast as Germany 
and France, three times faster than Japan.   
 
19:24:19 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Two to three times faster is an unheard of difference in performance.  This difference 
has been even greater -- it would have been -- it was even greater because the other 
countries have shared in the disproportionate benefit of American innovation.  And 
America has achieved this employment growth at median incomes that are 20 to 30 
percent higher than Germany, France, and Japan.  Because of this growth, today, 
America's home to 37 million adult immigrants.  There are 16 million native-born 
children, and all the children of those 53 million adults.  So perhaps wages would have 
grown faster in the supply of labor had been more restricted.  But it's disingenuous to 
close one eye, ignore America's extraordinary employment growth relative to its peers, 
and claim that income inequality hurts the middle and the working class.  No other 
economy has done more to help the middle class and working poor than the U.S.  
economy. 
 
19:25:19 
 
 And that's why you should vote against the motion that income inequality impairs the 
American dream of upward mobility.  To persuade you that the success of America's top 
earners subtracts from everyone else's income, our opponents will claim that successful 
Americans use cronyism to misappropriate their earnings.  If these Americans had 
misallocated the amount of resources that are necessary to achieve their success, 
growth would have slowed relative to other economies with more equally distributed 
income.  The opposite occurred.  America's growth accelerated relative to its peers.  
Rising cronyism can't explain the faster growth of the United States.  And that's not to 
say there isn't cronyism.  There is.  But the status quo is under assault from innovation 
more than it's ever been.  The turnover of CEOs, Fortune 500 companies, and Forbes 
400 wealthiest Americans have all accelerated.  That's a far cry from crony capitalism.  
And it wasn't crony capitalism that produced America's success. 
 
19:26:19 
 
It was hard work and entrepreneurial risk taking.  Nick's right.  Information technology 
made our knowledge workers more productive, and it opened up a large window of low-
cost investment opportunities.  And this increased the productivity and pay of our most 
talented workers and gave rise to a growing number of successful entrepreneurs.  
Americans were uniquely successful at capitalizing on these opportunities.  Their growth 
didn't hurt America.  It made us stronger.  So, to avoid debating the truth, Nick went 
down this path.  Our opponents will retreat to a more ambiguous claim, that perhaps 
we could have raised living standards even more if we'd attack success more heavily.  
Even if that's true, upward mobility has not been impaired.  And therefore you should 
vote against the motion.  And even if you believe that higher taxes distribute more 
income to the middle class than they destroy, you should at least recognize that there's 
very little evidence supporting this highly speculative claim. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - 10/23/2014

  Arlington, VA 22203 

19:27:15 
 
In the real world, Germany, France, and Japan all distributed income more equally, and 
none of them produced faster employment growth than America, nor, despite more 
restricted supplies of labor, did they grow their median incomes faster than the United 
States since the early 1990s.  In the academic world, there have been no less than six 
highly regarded cross country studies on the effect of income inequality on growth, by 
economists at Harvard, MIT, the OECD, the World Bank, the IMF.  All of them have 
reached the same conclusion:  Inequality accelerates growth in high-wage economies.  
The IMF's most recent study, whose headlines insisted that redistribution does not slow 
growth, admitted, redistribution above the 75 percentile is indeed harmful to growth as 
the Okun Big Tradeoff suggests.  Guess which country's at the 75th percentile?  The 
United States.  Another of these studies also conditions the Okun Big Tradeoff and 
found that by 2001, the growth-promoting effects of inequality had pushed the income 
of the bottom 90 percent above what it would have been if their share of income hadn't 
fallen.   
 
19:28:24 
 
So even if this briefly stated evidence fails to persuade you, it doesn't mean that the 
success of our top earners hurts America.  Quite the contrary.  Not only has America's 
much faster growth created employment for tens of millions of additional workers at 
much higher median wages than other â€“ and median incomes -- than other high-wage 
economies, it has improved every capable child's chances of earning a higher standard 
of living.  Even Emmanuel Saez agrees.  So, please, don't succumb to our opponentsâ€™ 
divisive politics.  Even if you support higher taxes, the success of America's top earners is 
an asset, not a liability.  Vote against the motion that success impairs upward mobility. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Ed Conard. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And that is our motion Income Inequality Impairs the American Dream of Upward 
Mobility.  And that concludes round one.  Now we move on to round two in our debate.   
 
19:29:21  
 
Round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions 
from me and from you in the audience.  A reminder of where we are.  We have two 
teams of two arguing for and against this motion:  Income Inequality Impairs the 
American Dream of Upward Mobility.  We have heard the team arguing for the motion, 
Elise Gould and Nick Hanauer say, you know, some inequality is built into the system, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

and some inequality is even a spur to innovation.  But a point comes where it becomes 
too much, and it can actually kill the American dream.  They talked about how low 
income families cannot invest in their kids' futures.  That if you can't buy eyeglasses for 
the kid in school, then the kid's not going to do well in school, and his opportunity will 
be limited.  They say, basically, using the image of a ladder, that if the rungs are spread 
farther apart than they ever have been before and the top is higher than it's ever been 
before that intuitively, it becomes much more difficult to climb, that the distance from 
the bottom to the top has become staggering. 
 
19:30:21 
 
The team arguing against the motion, Scott Winship and Ed Conard also acknowledge 
that there is a lot of -- also acknowledge that there is a lot of income inequality, but they 
say that is not the cause of a loss in upward mobility in the United States.  They say 
compared to other nations where income is much flatter, that the United States has 
greater mobility.  They cite a number of studies that have looked at this and have 
crunched the numbers, comparing income inequality with the mobility and they find 
that there is no meaningful relationship and that the downward pressure on wages in 
the United States, which they acknowledge is real, has other causes.  But they say the 
success of the top earners in America is not to blame for America's problems.  So, I 
found it interesting that Scott Winship, who is arguing against the motion, said that the 
motion as phrased, Income Inequality Impairs the American Dream of Upward Mobility, 
sounds intuitively correct, but is factually wrong. 
 
19:31:22 
 
And I want to go to Elise Gould who's arguing for the motion and -- and your opponent's 
point is that the studies show us something that's not intuitively correct.  And you're the 
economist, and you're the one who knows the studies.  And it's difficult to get into 
dueling studies, but does he have a point that the majority -- or the consensus, as he put 
it, of the studies, should that the numbers just aren't there? 
 
Elise Gould: 
Well, I think -- on the one hand, he's absolutely right, that the research is not conclusive, 
that mobility has declined.  There is some research from people at the Chicago Fed -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
[unintelligible]. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Elise Gould: 
That's right. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
Well, she's not done quite yet. 
 
Male Speaker: 
I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.   
 
 Elise Gould: 
But I think that the argument that we've seen growing income inequality happen over 
the last generation, over the last 30 years, income inequality has gotten worse. 
 
19:32:15 
 
When we want to really measure this, we're kind of at a loss because we have to wait, 
we have to see what happens as those kids growing up in the most unequal times, what 
is going to happen with their outcomes, which is why I look at education, because that's 
what we can see today.  We can look at those opportunities that lead to a realization of 
the American dream, and those opportunities are simply not there, and not there to an 
increasing extent. 
 
John Donvan: 
Scott Winship. 
 
Scott Winship: 
Well, you hear this a lot I think as a sort of retreating move.  When folks acknowledge 
that mobility has not fallen, you do hear this argument about, "Well, you know, we'll see 
it in today's generation," maybe.  But I will say that the study that was done by 
Emmanuel Saez with Raj Chetty, who's a Harvard economist that won the award for the 
smartest economist under 40 with seven years to spare, they look at young adults.  They 
look at people who are in their late 20s.   
 
19:33:19 
 
They measured the parental incomes in the mid-1990s.  At that point they'd 
experienced rising income concentration.  The share of income received by the top 1 
percent had been rising at that point for 15 years, and it didn't show up in their results.  
So none of us can predict the future.  We could have this debate again in 20 years.  And 
if the evidence says that we did experience declining mobility, I will be as concerned 
about it as anyone. 
 
John Donvan: 
And, Nick Hanauer, I mean, I don't want to dwell forever on these studies, but they are 
the evidence we have, and your partner has conceded that there at least is not a 
consensus on this.  What do we do with studies that are done by serious economists 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

who are respected, peer reviewed, who are telling us that they can't find evidence that 
your side of the motion is actually correct? 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
I think -- 
 
John Donvan: 
And everybody needs to -- yeah, if you mind, maybe just pulling your seat right into the -
- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- because just for the radio audience, if you're that far away, they end up hearing you 
like this -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
And it doesn't come across in the room, but it's for real.  Nick Hanauer. 
 
19:34:20 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
Yeah, so just because the industrialized nations have not been radically unequal enough 
to allow economists to do timescale studies to prove that it will be harmful doesn't 
mean it's not.  And, in fact, if you look around the world, there are 205 countries 
running simultaneous experiments on how to create prosperous societies.  And in every 
single case where you find radical inequality you find low social economic mobility 
around the world, right?  This is not -- this is not a far-out concept.  There is very low 
economic mobility in highly unequal places in every place that you look.  And so, you 
know, the truth is that the United States has only been a highly unequal society for 10 to 
20 years.  Thirty years ago it was not that bad.   
 
19:35:20 
 
And so, the fact that you don't -- we haven't had the time to measure it doesn't tell you 
anything.  Your common sense, on the other hand, should inform you highly. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ed Conard.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Edward Conard: 
Yeah, Nick is doing something that a lot of mobility scholars on the left try to do.  They 
want to mix the results from high wage economies with low wage economies.  And 
everybody serious in this field separates those apart.  You have to look at them 
separately.  And when you look at high wage economies, you simply don't find what 
Nick's saying.  The second thing I'd ask is, "Well, when we think about going into the 
future --" we do know this about the future, if we look backwards at the past, things 
have gotten more prosperous over time.  The amount of money that we transfer in this 
economy has grown from about 11 percent to about 14 percent today. 
 
John Donvan: 
You used the term -- explain the term, "transfer" -- 
 
Edward Conard: 
It's money that we take from one group of people in the economy and give to the other. 
 
John Donvan: 
Through what devices? 
 
Edward Conard: 
Through taxation, government intervention. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Edward Conard: 
A lot of that goes to the elderly.  But the CBOs look very carefully at the income that 
goes to the nonelderly families in the bottom 20 percent.   
 
19:36:23  
 
In 2006 when they did the study, it was $15,000.  It doesn't include state transfers, 
which brings it up to closer to 20.  It's grown with inflation since then.  Today it is very 
close to about $25,000.  Now, Nick, you've said it's $8,000.  You look at another CBO 
study, it simply looks at the means tested piece of it, but there's many more pieces than 
the means tested piece, and there are other CBO studies that have looked very carefully 
at this.  So, we do know this in the future, the amount of transfer that we are giving to 
people at the bottom of the income distribution is growing faster than the economy, is 
increasing over the time.  It has gotten significant in size.  We are doing a lot to try to 
help people at the bottom of the scale, and to increase their mobility.  And as we go 
forward into the future, we're going to be doing even more and more.  And what is 
driving that?  The success of our economy is making that available.  And there are 
studies â€“ Dollar and Kraay for example.

They look at the bottom 20 percent across many different economies.  What do they 
find?  The bottom 20 percent is highly correlated -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Edward Conard: 
-- to median wage. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's -- 
 
Edward Conard: 
The more it grows, the better the poor are. 
 
John Donvan: 
Elise Gould, let's have you respond. 
 
Elise Gould: 
I mean, what we've seen if we look -- as you said -- we should look at other advanced 
economies.  And I -- and as I said in my opening remarks, we have lower mobility than 
Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Japan, Spain, France -- a number of countries that 
are advanced economies.  And you brought up some research about Miles Corak.  And 
we're not going to debate Miles Corak this or Miles Corak that.  But the paper that I 
cited earlier, that family background is twice as important in determining children's 
success in the U.S.  as in Canada is also from a Miles Corak paper from this year.  And he 
finds pronounced stickiness, particularly at the top and the bottom of the distribution, 
meaning that kids from high income families are far more likely to be high income.  Kids 
from low income families are far more likely to be low income.  Less stickiness, so much 
in the middle. 
 
19:38:20 
 
And I want to respond to one other thing that Ed said about transfers in resources.  One 
thing you said in your opening comments -- you mentioned helping the working poor.  
The idea that we have working poor in this country is -- I just -- I think it just leaves such 
a bad taste in my mouth, that we have people that are hardworking, working full-time -- 
maybe full-year -- and they can't lift their families out of poverty.  We absolutely need to 
think about -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me stop -- let me stop you --

Elise Gould: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- and just -- and go to Ed, because the question was directed at you.  And the last thing 
that Elise said goes to the point of our motion -- that they can't lift themselves out of 
poverty.  But that would be the question of mobility.  She paints a very compelling, 
again, intuitive picture of that.  What's your response to that? 
 
Edward Conard: 
Well, I think there are many people who have a difficult time lifting themselves out of 
poverty.  If you're sick, you're going to have a difficult time.  If you have mental illness, 
drug addiction, many different things -- if you were convicted of a crime and you're an 
ex-convict, it's going to be difficult for you to lift yourself out of poverty.  But there are 
many, many, many people who can lift themselves out of poverty.   
 
19:39:24  
 
Tens of millions of Hispanic immigrants have come across the border.  They were 
making $2, $3 an hour.  They're making $7 to $15 today.  Many of them -- many more 
than that.  And they have -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Edward Conard: 
-- lifted themselves out of poverty.  But I would like -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No.  Actually, I want to go back to -- I just wanted to have you -- an interruption to that 
point.  And I want -- I will come back to you.  Elise, I just want to come back to you with 
that question.  All right.  Conceding that some people can't lift themselves out of 
poverty, what does that have to do with people being very rich at the top? 
 
Elise Gould: 
Well [unintelligible], letâ€™s just say the pie hasn't gotten bigger.  It hasn't gotten smaller 
from rising -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
It's gotten much bigger. 
 
Elise Gould: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

-- income inequality.  Let's say the pie stays the same size.  And if we know that a larger 
share of the pie is going to the top, that means that there's less there for everybody 
else.  When there's less there for everybody else, there's fewer resources going 
particularly to the bottom -- is what we're going to talk about here -- particularly at the 
bottom, there's fewer resources. 
 
19:40:23 
 
And parents cannot afford to make those investments.  Children are living in far more 
stressful home environments.  Unemployment is more common.  There's less stable 
housing.  And all of those things provide a situation where children just do not have the 
same opportunities -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Scott Winship, in your opening statement, I think I heard you also agree with your 
opponents.  While you were arguing against this motion, you agreed with them that 
there is a threat to opportunity.  Did I heard you correctly in that? 
 
Scott Winship: 
You heard me correctly that I do agree that we have upward mobility that is too limited 
in the United States.  So, the figures that I like to cite, if you are born in the bottom fifth, 
raised in the bottom fifth, you only have about a 30 to 40 percent chance of making it, 
either to the middle class or better than that.  That's far too low in my book. 
 
19:41:16  
 
But it's -- it's a leap to say that the reason for that limited upward mobility is because of 
income inequality or because income inequality has risen.  And I think that's the 
fundamental question today.  I'm as concerned as anybody about how do we increase 
upward mobility rates.  But I just think -- if you're talking about bang for your buck, 
focusing on -- on bringing the incomes at the top down, it's just not going to buy you 
much. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  So, you're saying the problems are real, but the cause is not the fact that people 
like Nick Hanauer are making a lot of money.  Nick Hanauer.  You think it is? 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
Yeah.  I -- no.  No.

I mean -- look, I mean, you misunderstand our point.  I do not, for a moment, believe 
that the problem with the economy is that we have too much success and we should 
hinder it in some way. 
 
19:42:13 
 
I simply believe that it seems obvious that the most successful should pay into the pot 
enough so that we can generate the increasing -- the virtual cycle of increasing returns if 
capitalism can be.  And there are a variety of things we have to do to close the 
inequality gap and to create more opportunity for people.  It's certainly not discouraging 
success.  But raising tax rates for private equity investors from the abomination of 15 
percent to 39 does not discourage success.  It simply allows -- it creates enough money 
to begin to help people who are struggling in their daily lives to actually have 
opportunity, to have a decent education, to have a decent place to live, to put food on 
the table, to lead a somewhat normal life. 
 
19:43:18 
 
You know, so these two things -- these are not -- we are not claiming that we need to 
eliminate success.  We need more success.  But the economy grows, the more 
successful people become.  It's not driven by a couple of people at the top like me and 
Ed.  It's driven by everyone else out there.  And that's the point -- that's the economy.  
It's the dynamic interaction of buyers and sellers, not the bank accounts of the rich.

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

I mean, I'll -- I'll respond to some of these comments if you like.  I think -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No, I thought you were raring to, but -- 
 
Edward Conard: 
Well, I'll go back to one point, which is take, for example, test prep that we've talked 
about and how much parents are preparing.  There are two kinds of colleges.  There's 
prestigious colleges which have a limited number of slots, and then there's other 
colleges which basically have an unlimited number of slots.   
 
19:44:20 
 
What's happened is that in the prestigious -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
 
Edward Conard: 
In the prestigious colleges, we have allocated more and more slots to lower income 
students and to minority students.  And as a result, what you find is that rich white 
students are working harder and harder for a limited number of slots in the most 
prestigious schools.  And so it's disingenuous to say that test prep is reducing mobility at 
a time when we're increasing the number of slots and trying to increase mobility.  At the 
same time, at the low -- at the less prestigious schools, anybody who's capable of going, 
who takes the test and is able to get through the school, can go to those schools.  There 
is no shortage of slots.  We've increased the number of slots.  We've increased the 
number of students participating in that.  So, it would be unfair, for example, to say, 
"Gee, there's more and more rich students going to those schools than there are poor 
schools -- poor students today."  Any student who can get there can get there.  And we 
have spent more and more money trying to help people get as far as they can in life.   
 
19:45:24 
 
And we've tried to help those people at the bottom who are not able to pull themselves 
out of poverty.  It's not as though we're letting those people starve to death.  We are 
giving them a substantial amount of money to try to help them maintain some standard 
of living at that level.  So, I think it's just difficult to make the argument that mobility is 
declining over time.  We're doing everything we can to increase it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Elise Gould, do you want to respond to that?  Conceding -- I mean, giving that 
you're conceding that studies don't show that mobility is declining over time, but take 
on the point about education because you're talk -- you're sort of saying, let's look at 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

the future, and let's look at -- let's look at the mechanisms in place and the trend and 
what seems inevitable and intuitive. 
 
Elise Gould: 
Yes.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait.  I'm not supposed to be doing -- putting words in your mouth like that so -- 
 
Elise Gould: 
No, no, I'm going to -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Elise Gould: 
-- talk about what I'm planning on talking about today. 
 
John Donvan: 
Very good. 
 
Elise Gould: 
You didn't feed me anything.  I'm not so sure about there being infinite slots in all the 
other schools, but that's another question. 
 
19:46:21 
 
[applause] 
 
Elise Gould: 
And test prep is really far more available to the higher income, so that's not really where 
I want to go either.  I think the direction I want to go is inequality at the starting gate.  
And from that, I mean inequality at the beginning of kindergarten.  These differences 
are found very early on.  The differences in resources available to higher income 
children is far greater than available to lower income children.  As I said before, higher 
rates of unemployment, instability, lower income, all of those things absolutely come at 
a cost to kids.  And you see vast disparities, even the first day of kindergarten.  And 
schools do their best to try to maintain -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But let me -- let me just stop you for a second because I'm just looking at the motion on 
the screen behind you.  And you're saying that poverty causes these problems, and I 
think your opponents agree with that.  But they're disagreeing -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Elise Gould: 
Yep. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- with you that the fact that there's an -- that there is some very, very -- there's a top 1 
percent that's way, way up at the ladder is at the root of these problems. 
 
19:47:25 
 
Elise Gould: 
If -- 
 
John Donvan: 
So, that makes it impossible for -- that that's the fact that -- that's who the motion is, 
that that inequality makes it impossible for people to move out of that situation. 
 
Elise Gould: 
Right.  I would argue that the growth in inequality has led to more poverty in this 
country as opposed to what the counter factual would be.  So if we had had, let's say 
from the late '50s to the mid '70s, we had economic growth that was associated with 
falling poverty rates.  If that relationship had continued, if, as the economy grew, we 
had broadly shared prosperity across the entire distribution, then we would have 
basically eradicated poverty by the 1980s.  So, this is absolutely a discussion about the 
size of the pie, not just the size of the pie, but the distribution of those resources of the 
pie.  And it's not just about the bottom. 
 
19:48:15 
 
 If we were to look at what happened to middle income families, and my research shows 
that if you were to look at sort of the wedge that's created by this growing inequality, 
that the typical family today would be making 18,000 more dollars in just one year.  
Those are substantial resources that American families could put a lot more energy into 
investments in their children. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  So take it to you, Scott Winship.  What I think I hear Elise saying is, it's not -- the 
relevant issue is not that there are a lot of people that are very rich, it's that there are a 
lot of people that are very poor, that that level of inequality, those depths are very, very 
difficult to move out of and therefore there is immobility at that -- at that level. 
 
Scott Winship: 
Well, I think poverty is too high in America.  But it's lower than -- quite a bit lower than 
it was in the 196 -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
But how escapable is it? 
 
Scott Winship: 
I'm sorry? 
 
John Donvan: 
How escapable is it? 
 
Scott Winship: 
It's probably -- you know, I am fortunate enough not to have grown up poor, I'm 
guessing it's still very difficult to escape.  I mean, the bottom line is if you -- if you start 
in the bottom, you have something like a 40 to 50 percent chance that you're going to 
stay in the bottom as an adult. 
 
19:49:23 
 
But the question on the table, I think, is whether income inequality is behind that.  And I 
think the evidence just isn't there.  So one reason I think that you might worry about 
rising inequality is if the attainments of the poor were actually getting worse.  But that's 
generally not what you find.  Test scores have risen among the poor.  College graduation 
has risen among the poor.  The problem is that in a lot of cases it's risen faster at the 
top.  But it's a very different situation than I think the depiction that as income 
inequality has risen, it's sort of been just this -- this brutal shift for people at the bottom.  
I think it's always been tough to be poor, but I don't think it's tougher today because the 
top 1 percent share has gone from a very high 10 percent to an even higher 24 percent. 
 
John Donvan: 
Nick Hanauer, you -- you've heard your opponents say, to some degree, that the pie is 
bigger because of the people who are successful at the top. 
 
19:50:25 
 
And in your opening remarks, you made the argument that that just doesn't make 
sense.  But can you elaborate a little bit now that they've made more of a point, that 
their hard work, ingenuity, investment, risk taking actually causes -- you know, actually 
grows the pie overall. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
We're in violent agreement about that our economy benefits massively from very clever 
and very hard working people taking risks and innovating.  That's not the question.  The 
question is, should only a few percent of us be able to do that.  And the answer to that 
is categorically no.  I mean, look, here's the way to connect these two things.  Why are 
the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer?  Well, here's a reason, because over 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

the last 40 years, the percent of profits that American corporations generate as a 
percentage of GDP, has gone from 6 to 12 percent.   
 
19:51:22 
 
At the same time, the percent of GDP devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42.  So that 
difference is about a trillion dollars annually.  So that -- here's the thing you have to 
understand.  That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to 
be.  It's profit because powerful people like me and Ed prefer it to be.  That trillion 
dollars could very easily be spent on wages. 
 
[applause] 
 
Or on discounts for consumers.  This isn't a consequence of some magical law of 
economics.  This is a consequence of differentials in power.   
 
19:52:14 
 
And the thing is -- 
 
[applause] 
 
-- the thing is, is that if that trillion dollars was, instead of stuck in my bank account and 
Ed's bank account, but instead was coursing through the economy as wages and 
opportunity, we'd  have more innovators, we'd  have more risk-takers.  That's the 
beautiful thing about capitalism.  If you set it up right, it works super well. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Ed Conard. 
 
Edward Conard: 
I do think there's a popular argument which is, "Investment waits for demand, and if we 
don't get the customer demand, we won't get the investment."  But it isn't true.  
Investment doesn't wait for demand.  Apple will create an iPhone, and Samsung will 
come up with a competition, and Microsoft will scramble to fix their problem.  There's a 
lot of turn of the economy -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- and there's a lot of investment in the economy.  And the people who are generating 
that investment -- the money that Nick's saving which is funding those investments 
causes a lot of other consumption in our economy and puts a lot of other people to 
work.  And so what these guys have done, because their argument isn't stronger, they

retreat to a mathematical truth, which is this, "If the pie stays the same and we split it 
up different, people would have $18,000 more money." 
 
19:53:23 
 
 Germany, France, Japan, they've all tried it, they all distribute income more equally, and 
they are not able to achieve the median incomes that we achieve in the United States.  
And why is that? 
 
[applause] 
 
Because there's another economic truth that they don't want to admit to which is you 
have to get a customer to pay somebody $18,000 more a year to buy the product to pay 
them that.  And if you can't do that, all the mathematical splitting of the world won't 
solve your problem. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I want to go to some questions and answers now from the audience.  And the 
way this will work, if you raise your hand, I'll call upon you.  And the microphone will be 
brought down to you.  The same thing, hold the mike close to your mouth so that the

Please go to the question. 
 
Female Speaker: 
All right.  So the question is if the children from lower income families can't afford the 
investment in the programs that are necessary in order to achieve the grades necessary 
to go to college, it's not an issue of the money getting into the school, because, yes, 
they're giving it away, but if they can't -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Ma'am, I need you to get to a question. 
 
Female Speaker: 
-- the question is how can they compete to get into these schools if they don't have the 
knowledge necessary because they can't buy it the way that the wealthier families can?

Scott Winship: 
Sure, well -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Scott Winship.  Thank you. 
 
Scott Winship: 
-- you know, I think the real key is that you look at the positions where kids start out and 
the positions where they end up.  And that's why for so long the conventional wisdom 
was, as Elise said, that the U.S.  had such worse mobility than other countries because it 
didn't actually look at that if it was a measure that showed worse mobility when 
inequality rose mechanically.  And so that was the innovation of Miles Corak's newest 
paper, where he looks at ranks of parents, ranks of kids.  The other paper that you cited 
by him was older.  I actually commissioned it while I was at Pew. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Elise, do you want to respond to that or we can move on if you want to.  We'll move on?  
Okay, and then I'm going to come to this side.  Sir, yes, [affirmative]. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Hi, my name's Hans [spelled phonetically].  I'm just going to add chickens and eggs into 
ladders and pies.  Can you tell me why wages versus employment -- is it the chicken and 
egg argument, 40 years ago, why people would have chosen for higher rates of 
employment versus higher wages?  Why isn't it just one before the other? 
 
John Donvan: 
Edward Conard.  And Ed, if you can move in, too. 
 
19:57:25 
 
Edward Conard: 
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by chosen.  I think what ends up happening is 
if you have a restricted supply of labor and you get growth, you'll get higher wages.  And 
if you have an unrestricted supply of labor, you'll get higher employment.  It's -- and 
you'll get a little bit of both.  Where you end, I mean, I suppose it's Newton's Third Law 
of Momentum, how much of it ends up in employment and how much of it ends up in 
wages?  But some of that has to do with real natural restrictions in the physical world.  I 
you don't have the employees, then you're going to get the wage growth as there's 
more and more demand for that labor.  If you have an unrestricted supply, you're going

to get faster employment growth.  We got two -- three times faster employment growth 
than Japan, twice as fast the employment growth of Germany and France, the two big 
economies in Europe.  We have even faster growth from most of the other economies in 
Europe.  We can find Norway or something like that, with oil, which can be slightly 
different, but it's not that much different.

To answer your question, I think that Ed is maybe oversimplifying a little bit.

We have seen employment growth and we haven't seen wage growth.  But we have a 
period in recent history -- in the late '90s -- when we saw strong wage growth.  We saw 
a tighter economy.  We saw higher employment.  We saw, arguably, full employment.  
And that meant that wages across the entire wage distribution actually rose.  And we 
saw that everywhere, and we actually saw stronger growth at the bottom than 
anywhere else.  And so, I think you can see higher employment.  You can also see higher 
wages.  It's not -- it's not -- I don't want to oversimplify that. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
Yeah.  I would just like to add -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
-- that, you know, the fundamental of capitalism is when workers have more money, 
businesses have more customers, and need more workers.  That's what -- why the role 
of policy is to solve the collective action system -- a collective action problem and push 
wages up for all workers, because when you do, it's good for business and for workers. 
 
John Donvan: 
Scott Winship. 
 
Scott Winship: 
Just to address -- I want to agree with Elise, again, that the 1950s and 60s were this 
amazing period for the poor.

And the middle class incomes grew more than they did at the top.  But again, I think -- 
it's a leap to argue that the reason we have that -- that period was because inequality 
was low.  The slowdown in incomes at the bottom and in the middle class started in the 
1970s, a full decade before income concentration began rising at the top. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's go to another question.  Right down front here. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Hi, I'm Mike.  I was expecting to hear the against side arguing a lacking relationship 
between the two, between inequality and upward mobility.  Instead, I kind of heard you 
guys suggesting that inequality can drive upward mobility.  So, I'm wondering if you 
would advocate active and systemic mechanisms to do just that, to increase inequality 
as a tough love mechanism â€“  
 
[laughter]  
 
-- to help the poor.   
 
20:00:17 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
That's about the best question we've had in about a year.   
 
[laughter] 
 
Edward Conard. 
 
Edward Conard: 
I think that customers decide how much people get paid, how much they're willing to 
pay for products and for employees and such.  And so, anything that gets in the way 
slows growth.  It doesn't increase growth.  And so, no.  I would be against any policy 
that tried to artificially do what customers don't want.  What customers want will 
improve the success of our -- of our economy.  I would also remind Elise that in the 
1990s, we commercialized the Internet and e-mail.  It was like the telephone.  We had 
enormous growth in the 1990s as a result, faster than the supply of labor, and it drove 
up the wages.  If we can find another one of those, we'll have great -- we'll have great 
growth.

that CEO to the average worker pay should go from 30 to one 30 years ago to almost 
300 to one today.

John Donvan: 
I'm going to pass again because we're not debating what the solutions are. 
20:02:20 
 
Fair question, and we may do a debate on it at some point.  Sir, in the corner there. 
 
Male Speaker: 
My name is Ben.  For the for side, I would assume that the argument is not that if we 
lock Nick and Ed up that mobility would increase and that instead it involves transfers of 
wealth to others.  And my question, if that is part of your solution, is transferring income 
from one group to others really consistent with your definition of the American dream 
of upward mobility. 
 
Elise Gould: 
Oh, that's a great -- 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Nick Hanauer. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
Yeah.  So -- so transfers are a very small part of the solution here.  Requiring businesses 
to pay workers a living wage is not a transfer.  That's solving a collective action problem.  
Requiring businesses to pay middle class employees overtime is not a transfer.  It's a 
fairness and collective action problem.   
 
20:03:19 
 
And there are all sorts of ways that everyone benefits when every business pays its 
workers more, including every business, right?  Because when every business pays its 
workers a decent wage, every business has more customers and every taxpayer is 
spared the expense of sending their tax dollars to the government to pay for the food 
stamps that low-wage workers require.  So it has less to do with transfers than other 
things. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  I want to remind you that we are in the question-and-answer section of this 
Intelligence Squared U.S.  debate.  I'm John Donvan, your moderator.  And we have four 
debaters, two against two, debating this motion:  Income Inequality Impairs the 
American Dream of Upward Mobility.  More questions, right down front, sir.  And this

Hi.  What about the aspirational aspect of the -- of the spread, the inequality spread.   
 
20:04:19 
 
In "Freakonomics," Steven Dubnner talked about the drug dealers and how many people 
were in that trade because there was a chance that they might be able to get to the very 
top.  And if the top is getting higher, is that becoming more aspirational and potentially 
improving mobility? 
 
John Donvan: 
Does the top rung really give you something to shoot for?  Okay.  That's a really 
interesting question.  Let's take it to Ed Conard.  Would you like to take that, or your 
partner? 
 
Edward Conard: 
Yes.  I think that innovation is like any game of chance; the higher the payoff, the more 
risk people will take.  And so what we have seen in our economy is that as we've raised 
the bar for success, our most capable people at the highest end, or our highest earning 
people have worked harder and harder, more and more hours than the rest of the world 
and have taken more and more entrepreneurial risk and produced way more innovation 
than the rest of the world has.  And ultimately, that's translated into a much higher 
growth rate.  And so we do keep raising the bar.  And it's not really the bar for money.  
That's not what motivates people.  It's the status that goes along with it.   
 
20:05:19  
 
And as the bar gets raised, you have to achieve more and more to get to the same level 
of status.  And that drives our most talented people to work harder and harder and take 
more risks.  And that is what everybody else needs from the most talented people.  We 
need those people working hard.  And in America, we've been able to achieve that.  And 
the failure of Europe and Japan to duplicate our success shows how difficult it is to 
motivate the most talented people, to get the training that really grows the economy, to 
put in the hours that really grows the economy and to take the entrepreneurial risk of 
which 99 percent of them, more than 99 percent of them, will fail, and they'll be set 
back in their careers as a as a result, which is not to say these talented people won't 
have a career.  They'll have a career.  But if they spend 10 years in the garage trying to 
do something, and then they go back to their career, they'll be behind where everybody 
else was. 
 
John Donvan: 
Nick Hanauer. 
 
Edward Conard: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 - 10/23/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And that's what we need to do to get our economy to grow and to get more people 
employed at higher wages. 
 
John Donvan: 
Nick Hanauer. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
So quick audience poll with your hands, not the buttons:  Who thinks they work harder 
than their parents? 
 
20:06:23 
 
John Donvan: 
You need to tell the radio audience what you're seeing. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
Two-thirds of the room.  Do you -- do you think you work harder than your parents 
because your tax rates are lower than theirs?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  So hard 
work is -- is an extremely important thing, but it is completely uncorrelated to the tax 
rates we pay.  That's the first point.  And the second thing is -- and this is the most 
difficult thing to talk about when we talk about upward mobility and the American 
dream and inequality.  And that is this:  That humans are status seeking creatures.  We 
are not optimizing for money.  We are optimizing for sort of social position. 
 
20:07:13 
 
And when you go from a world where to fly first class is to be affluent, wealthy, to a 
world where you have to have a $25 million Falcon 2000 to be affluent, to live large, you 
have stretched the society apart in a way that means that 99.999 percent of the people 
in the society cannot live the good life.  And I would argue -- 
 
John Donvan: 
You don't think that people will aspire to that?  You think they'll be turned off by it. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
I don't think that they will aspire one iota more in the second scenario than the first.  It's 
just that in the second scenario, 99.999 percent of you fail.  And I would argue that 
having a society that is an arms race, that is structured to be an arms race, that no one 
except me and maybe a couple other people in the audience, can possibly win, is a 
winning solution to building a good society.

John Donvan: 
Scott Winship. 
 
[applause] 
 
Scott Winship: 
I think it's a little bit disingenuous to take a poll and say that tax rates don't affect work.  
I mean, the argument that smart people on the left that I know make about why 
inequality at the top has risen is because of the Reagan tax cuts, right?  The Reagan tax 
cuts -- this is the argument from the left -- increased the rewards to bargaining.  So I 
don't agree with this diagnosis.  But the left says, because tax cuts went down, it 
became more advantageous for people at the top to bargain, to take risk, to work more, 
and that's why income concentration has risen.  So, it's certainly not a foolish idea in 
economics if you ask any finance -- public finance person in economics. 
 
Edward Conard: 
I would also say this:  Ask the 50 million adult immigrants and their children whether or 
not they benefited from this arms race or they were hurt by this arms race. 
 
20:09:20 
 
He talks like a rich man, okay?  A poor guy benefits from the fact that we are working 
our tails over and taking the entrepreneurial risks and grow the economy and increase 
prosperity.  Rich guys walk around and say, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if we didn't have 
an arms race, and I didn't have to have my, whatever it was, Falcon something in order 
to be successful?" We need you to be working your tail off.  It's the poor people that 
need you to be working your tail off. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
The poor people are working their tails off. 
 
Elise Gould: 
Yes. 
 
Edward Conard: 
I didn't say -- I didn't say they weren't.  But in Europe and Japan, they have not been 
able to produce the innovation and the growth and the employment that the U.S.  
economy has.  It is two to three times faster.  It's an extraordinary difference. 
 
John Donvan: 
Do we have time for one more question?  We've been a little short on females tonight.

Female Speaker: 
Okay.  Well, I'm actually going to come from people on the left.  So, for example, you 
mentioned the CEO pay ratio.   
 
20:10:21  
 
I don't see how you can compare an economy that was completely manufacturing based 
to an economy that is information based and globalized.  It just makes sense if you're 
competing on a globalized scale that the pay -- the ratio scale would change as well. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Female Speaker: 
And you said that the rich are getting richer, but the poor are getting poorer. 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I need you to put a question or a little up speak at the end of it. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Okay.  Sorry.  But if the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, then why 
has our poverty rate declined once you include all the transfers that have been made 
and all that has been done?  I think it is -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, okay.  That was our question. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
Let me address -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Nick Hanauer. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
-- this CEO pay first.  So our companies are not more information based or more 
globalized than multinational big companies from around the world.  But the CEO pay in 
the United States, which expanded tenfold, that's not true in Norway.  It's not true in 
Australia.  It's not true in Canada.  It's not true in Germany or Japan. 
 
20:11:20 
 
They did not need to do that in order to run their companies.  And I think that that's 
why, when you look at the mobility data, it's much higher in all of those places.

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
Ed Conard. 
 
Edward Conard: 
If you look at the CEO pay in the U.S., it has not risen relative to the .1 percent.  The .1 -- 
and 90 -- 90 percent of the people in the .1 percent can't go to their board and ask for a 
pay raise.  They have to go to a customer and get them to buy something that will allow 
them to earn more money.  That is not the case â€“ 
 
John Donvan: 
Up, up, nope, that's -- 
 
Edward Conard: 
They're a lawyer, they're a doctor, they're whatever their who has to go and increase 
the revenues of their business in order to get a pay raise.  Now, what's happened is 
they've been much more successful in the United States than they have been in other 
countries.  And so as a result, the .1 percent in Sweden is much lower than the income 
than the .1 percent in the United States.  And therefore, it's cheaper to hire a CEO in 
Sweden than it is in the United States.   
 
20:12:16 
 
And if you want somebody who's in that high level of capability to run your company.  
That's the cost in the United States because of the alternatives that we have been able 
to create at the highest end of our wage scale. 
 
John Donvan: 
Elise Gould, did you want to respond? 
 
Elise Gould: 
Yeah, to the second part of your question, yes, transfers, absolutely, if you take 
transfers into account, we can reduce poverty using transfers.  And we can show that 
with the data absolutely.  And Social Security is the number one way that we have 
transferred income to the elderly and reduced poverty among the elderly.  But I think 
that we want to do better.  I think we should look -- if we look at wage-based poverty 
rates -- if we look at wage-based poverty rates they have actually gone up.  So the 
rewards to hard work, and you talk about working long hours, the only reason why 
people at the bottom have seen any increase in their annual earnings is because of how 
many more hours those households are working, and they are working really hard to 
make ends meet.

John Donvan: 
All right, I'm going to -- we have time for one more question.  Sir? 
 
Male Speaker: 
I don't want to get -- my name is Byron -- I'd like to get a piece of the trillion dollars that 
Nick is talking about.  It seems to me that when you apply for a job they offer you a 
salary, and if it's enough you take the job.  Now, what you're saying is that if the system 
were as you describe it that I would -- and I'm -- I accept $40,000 as the wage that I'm 
willing to work for, and if you're saying that in -- if you're going to divvy up an extra 
trillion dollars, even though I'm willing to go to work for $40,000, you'll pay me $50,000, 
is that the way you think the system will work?  And if you do it your way -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, that was a question.  Nick Hanauer. 
 
Male Speaker: 
--- the borders, believe me, will be mowed down. 
Nick Hanauer: 
Yeah, I don't -- I don't think that's a fair way of characterizing it, that the extra trillion 
dollars is profit because corporations have more power today than workers.   
 
20:14:23 
 
It once wasn't true.  We had unions, and we had even better labor standards than we 
have today, and those have eroded.  Again, the only difference, it's not an economic 
difference, it's simply a power difference.  And the question becomes, "What kind of a 
country do you want to have?  Do you want to have a country where a few people earn 
everything and most people earn nothing or do you want to have a country where most 
people do pretty well and everybody lives a life that includes upward mobility?  And my 
argument is that we generally should prefer the latter, and that is within the scope of 
our choice we can do that by using policy and politics to advance a commonsense 
agenda. 
 
John Donvan:

 And remember how you voted just before the debate began.  Immediately after closing 
statements, which are about to begin, we'll have you vote a second time.  And I just 
want to remind you about our rules.  It's the team whose numbers have moved the 
most in percentage point terms that will be declared our winner.  On to round three, 
closing statements from each debater in turn.  They will be two minutes each.  Here to 
summarize her position in support of the motion, "Income inequality impairs the 
American dream of upward mobility," Elise Gould, senior economist and director of 
health policy research at the Economic Policy Institute. 
 
Elise Gould: 
Thank you.  One of the most profound pieces of research that I've encountered in my 
tenure as a professional economist came from an interdisciplinary group of researchers.  
They examined the brains of hundreds of young children from various economic 
backgrounds, beginning at birth and following them every few months until four years 
of age. 
 
20:16:14 
 
And what they found is that children in poor families lagged behind the development of 
the frontal regions of the brain, deficits that help explain behavioral, learning, and 
attention problems more common among disadvantaged children.  What's striking is 
that the brains of the infants looked really similar.  You didn't see those differences at 
birth.  You start seeing the separation in brain growth between the children living in 
poverty and the more affluent children increase over time.  And that really implicates 
the environment in which they live.  It boiled down to an elevated fight or flight 
response from living in a more stressful home environment, which makes them less able 
to learn and succeed in school.  The researchers do note that these children are not 
doomed.  With the right investments, we can survive -- they can survive and contribute 
to society to the fullest extent.  Without that, they are really wasted resources.  It's no 
surprise that familiesâ€™ economic situation and particularly low levels of economic 
stability can wreak havoc on children's wellbeing and their success later in life.   
 
20:17:16 
 
While the mobility research has a few years to catch up as the children born in the most 
unequal times grow up -- the pathways are clear.  The evidence is there in black in white 
in those brain scans.  The truth is that income -- increasing incomes for those families at 
the bottom of the income distribution have extraordinary consequences for children's 
health, educational attainment, and future earnings.  It's not only well-founded, it's 
common sense.  If the economy had delivered jobs and growing wages to all those 
wanting to work and work hard, children across the income distribution would have a 
much better chance of succeeding and attaining the American Dream.  Luckily, there are 
steps we can take to reduce this trend, but let's not deny the facts.  Vote for increased 
opportunity.  Vote for the proposition.

And our proposition is Income Inequality Impairs the American Dream of Upward 
Mobility.  And here to summarize his position against this motion, Scott Winship, the 
Walter B.  Wriston fellow at the Manhattan Institute. 
 
20:18:16 
 
Scott Winship: 
Well, thanks, John.  As you heard John say at the beginning of the debate, Nick recently 
tried to convince his fellow zillionaires that income inequality has risen so much that 
they should fear for their safety.  So, I'll just quote: "You show me a highly unequal 
society, and I'll show you a police state, or an uprising.  There are no counter-examples.  
None.  It's not if.  It's when." But I can think of one example.  It comes from Emmanuel 
Saez -- we cited before.  Saez tells us that the top one percent in Manhattan -- top one 
percent of parents -- receive 54 percent of the income of all parents on this island, more 
than double the national figure.  That's also much higher than in King County, 
Washington, home to Seattle and to Nick Hanauer.  In King County, the top receives 25 
percent of parental income.  But the Saez data indicates that in Manhattan, low income 
children, those poorer than 75 percent of kids, typically, as adults, end up poorer than 
59 percent of their peers -- as late 20 somethings.   
 
20:19:24  
 
That's far too high.  But how high do poor children rise in King County?  They typically 
end up poorer than 73 percent of their peers.  They end up right where they started out.  
The issue tonight isn't whether poverty is a problem or whether lack of upward mobility 
is a problem.  As we've discussed tonight, there's a lot of consensus about both of those 
questions.  The question tonight is whether rising income inequality caused those 
problems, whether we would reduce them by reducing income inequality.  And as I've 
argued tonight, the evidence is just not there, as much as we might care about the poor 
and those who are stuck at the bottom.  So, I urge you tonight to oppose the motion on 
the table -- income inequality has not impaired the American Dream of upward mobility. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Scott Winship.

And that's the motion: Income Inequality Impairs the American Dream of Upward 
Mobility.  And here to summarize his position in support of this motion, Nick Hanauer.  
He is cofounder and partner at the venture capital firm, Second Avenue Partners. 
 
Nick Hanauer: 
Thank you.  Scott, I acknowledge that in some ways, economic inequality and mobility 
may not be as bad as some of the data suggests.  But I equally insist that in many ways, 
it is likely far worse than the data shows.  And Ed, people do, of course, need theoretical 
incentives.  But even more, they need practical opportunity.  For all of human history, 
wherever you have found concentrated wealth, you find its defenders and its apologists, 
the deniers.  The people who put lead in paint denied it was harmful.  The people who 
made cigarettes denied they gave us cancer.  The fossil fuel industry today denies global 
warming. 
 
20:21:16 
 
The packaged food industry denies that sugary soft drinks have anything to do with our 
epidemic of childhood obesity and diabetes, and how could we not have inequality 
deniers?  Like clockwork, they will tell you it's not happening, or if it is, it's really, really 
good for the economy and for the middle class in mobility.  Inequality tonight is being 
sold like high fructose corn syrup.  "Yummy.  Have some more." Really?  Really?  So, we 
should ignore the facts and the drowning feeling a majority of middle income Americans 
are experiencing today, as they watch the American Dream recede?  Our answer to 
them to be -- should -- our answer to them should be, "Hey, you just need to look at the 
data differently.  We should believe that the young men in Ferguson, Missouri elected 
not to become software engineers or partners at Bain because the theoretical incentives 
to take risk were not high enough." 
 
20:22:18 
 
Elise and I do not believe that, and we hope that you don't either.  You don't need a PhD 
in economics to see that extreme and rising inequality isn't just impairing the American 
dream of upward mobility.  Inequality is drowning it.

Edward Conard: 
Germany is the second most prosperous major economy in the world.  In Germany, the 
99 percent earns 47 percent of GDP.  In the United States, the 99 percent earns 47 
percent of GDP.  And that's 47 percent of a faster growing economy with median 
incomes that are 20 percent higher.  With America's 1 percent earning a larger share of 
GDP than their counterparts in Germany, how can it be the case that the 99 percent in 
both countries earn the same share of GDP.   
 
20:23:26  
 
Relative to Germany, the additional share earned by America's 1 percent comes entirely 
from the investors' share of GDP, not the share earned by the 99 percent.  So for those 
of you who continue to believe that the economy is a pie, please recognize that the 
larger share of America's 1 percent comes entirely from investors and not the 99 
percent.  With valuable on-the-job training at companies like Google, and access to 
networks of experts like Silicone Valley, the productivity of America's top earnings -- 
earners is higher than the rest of the world.  And given these advantages, it should come 
as no surprise that America's 1 percent creates a greater share of GDP relative to 
investors than their counterparts elsewhere.  And given this advantage, it should come 
as no surprise that the returns to college education are significantly higher in the United 
States than they are in any country in the world.   
 
20:24:20 
 
Ultimately, this debate boils down to whether the outside success of America's talent is 
an asset or a liability for the rest of the country.  By every measure, employment 
growth, median incomes, return to education and opportunities for immigration, the 
U.S.  provides more upward mobility than any other economy, even ultimate liberal 
Emmanuel Saez agrees.  Mobility has not declined.  And even if you believe that we 
ought to tax the rich more, it does not change the fact that the success of America's top 
earners do not impair the American dream of upward mobility.  They improve it.  Please 
vote against the motion. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Ed Conard.

John Donvan: 
And now it is time to learn which side has argued the best.  We're going to ask you again 
to go to the key pads at your seats and have you vote a second time.   
 
20:25:18 
 
Just as before, push number one if you are in support of the motion, income inequality 
impairs the American dream of upward mobility.  Push number two if you come out 
against this.  Push number three if you remain or became undecided.  And we will have 
the results in about a minute and a half and declare our winner.  Before we do that, I 
want to say it was a -- it was a relatively complex topic.  The motion itself has several 
moving parts, and I think debaters dealt with that really well and intelligently and in a 
spirit of respect for one another.  So, I want to congratulate them for the way they did 
this. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
A second thing I want to say, because of the complexity of the topic, I don't usually 
throw as many questions as I did tonight.  And I just want to say to the people whose 
questions I threw out, there is no disgrace or dishonor in that.  This is a topic where you 
can go off in a lot of different directions.  And to the 18-year-old high school student, I 
really hate not taking your question from a high school student.   
 
20:26:24 
 
We did a debate two years ago where the motion was "The Rich are Taxed Enough," 
which really went to some of the issues that I think people wanted to get to tonight.  
And it's on our -- it's available through our app actually, as all of our debates are, which 
you can get from Apple store and from the Google store.  I also want to thank -- take a 
moment and thank all of our generous supporters who have made these debates 
possible.  The ticket sales do not by any means come close to covering the cost of these 
debates.  So thank you to all of them and we encourage everybody else who is willing to 
make a visit to our website at iq2us.org and make a donation because every -- every gift 
counts for us.  So thank you to those who are here who have been our contributors. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Our next debate will be here at the Kaufman Center on Thursday, November 13th.  The 
motion will be, on November 13th, Legalize Assisted Suicide.

For the motion, we have Peter Singer.  He's a professor of bioethics at Princeton 
University, often described as the world's most important living, influential living 
philosopher.  His partner will be Andrew Solomon.  He's an award-winning author who 
has written about his own mother's assisted suicide.  Against the motion, we have 
Baroness Finlay who is -- she's a palliative care physician whose own mother considered 
assisted suicide, did not, and came to regain her full desire for life, so a very powerful 
personal anecdote in that; and Dr.  Daniel Sulmasy who is a professor of medicine and 
ethics at the Department of Medicine and the Divinity School at the University of 
Chicago.  Tickets are available at our website at iq2us.org.  And as I mentioned, we have 
the app.  You can look at all of our debates are available there.  We live stream on our 
website at iq2us and listen -- you can listen to all these debates on NPR stations across 
the nation.  Okay.  So, it's all in now.   
 
20:28:17 
 
I have the final results and recall that the way we determine victory here is the team 
whose numbers have changed the most between your two votes in our live audience 
here in New York, in percentage point terms.  So, let's see what the results are.  The 
motion was this:  Income Inequality Impairs the American Dream of Upward Mobility.  
Before the debate, 60 percent agreed with this motion.  14 percent were against.  26 
percent were undecided.  So, those are the first results.  Again, it's the difference 
between the first and second vote.  Let's look at the second vote.  The team arguing for 
the motion, Income Inequality Impairs the American Dream of Upward Mobility, their 
second vote was 53 percent.  They went from 60 percent down 7 percentage points to 
53 percent.  Let's look at the team against the motion.  Their first vote was 14 percent.  
Their second vote, 37 percent.  They went up 23 percentage points.  That's enough for 
victory by far.  The team arguing against the motion, Income Inequality Impairs the 
American Dream of Upward Mobility, is our winner.  Our congratulations to them.   
 
20:29:22 
 
Thank you from me, John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S.  We'll see you next time.
