BEGIN TAPE   

BRIAN LEHRER 

I want to introduce to you, Robert Rosenkranz, Chairman of the 

Rosenkranz Foundation, the sponsor of this evening’s debate, 

who will make some opening remarks.  [APPLAUSE]   

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Thank you, Brian, and, and welcome to all of you.  I’m Robert 

Rosenkranz, Chairman of Intelligence Squared, which is an 

initiative of the Rosenkranz Foundation.  With me tonight is Dana 

Wolfe, the Executive Producer of this, series of debates.  I see a 

number of, uh, a lot of familiar faces in the audience but also a 

lot of newcomers.  So let me just say a word about why we’re, 

we’re doing this.  It’s really with the intention of raising the level 

of public discourse in this country.  It comes from a feeling that, 

uh, political conversations are just too rancorous and that, this 

nation could benefit from a forum for reasoned discussion of, key 

policy issues.  The topic tonight is, is one that, uh, has attracted 

an enormous amount of, of interest.  The proposition:  Global 

warming is not a crisis.  And the, panelists are going to try to 

persuade you to vote for or against the motion.  Uh, ultimately 

your votes will decide which side has carried the day.  Uh, well, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 2. 

 

 

 

why this particular, topic?  Senator Barbara Boxer, Al Gore have 

assured us that on this particular topic the debate is over.  Well, 

we took that as throwing down the gauntlet and  I personally am 

cynical enough to think that perhaps there’s a distinction 

between science and political science.  Um, and maybe a side 

that feels like there is nothing to debate, might feel that there are 

perhaps some inconvenient truths on the other side that they 

would prefer not to deal with.  I’m old enough to remember when 

there was a, uh, scientific consensus on global cooling, and this 

was in the 1970s with all kinds of alarmist data on that subject.  

I’m enough of a businessman to know that the modeling and the 

use of the computer, uh, algorithms and forecasting the future is 

a very, very difficult undertaking.  I mean, if one could predict, 

uh, the weather or patterns of storms even a year in advance it 

would be worth billions and billions of dollars to people engaged 

in energy trading or, uh, or, insurance underwriting and a whole 

bunch of other pursuits.  And yet it can’t really be effectively 

done.  So tonight’s debate, I think, is addressing issues that for 

me are very real and, which, at Intelligence Squared we feel can 

use some serious enlightenment.  Uh, first of all, on the science 

of it.  Does science really have the, the ability to tell us with, with 

a good degree of reliability what is going to happen to our climate 

over a hundred year period?  And secondly, the economics.  Um, 

this all leads in effect to public policies that say, We should 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 3. 

 

 

 

invest, money now for benefits in the future.  Well, that always 

poses the traditional questions of, well, what are the costs?  What 

are the benefits?  What are the alternatives?  What are the risks 

of action?  What are the risks of inaction?  So there are a whole 

welter of economic aspects that I think, hopefully tonight we’re 

going to get some enlightenment on as well.  Uh, this evening, of 

course, is a live event but it will reach an audience through 

National Public Radio of over fifty radio stations around the 

country.  We’re produced for radio by by WNYC in New York.  

And it’s now time for me to turn the, uh, proceedings over to 

Brian Lehrer,  who is the award winning host of, WNYC’s New 

York public radio call in program, The Brian Lehrer Show.  This 

has been called New York City’s most thoughtful and informative 

talk show by Time magazine.  It covers politics and life locally, 

globally.  Brian not only holds a master’s degree in journalism 

but also a master’s in public health and environmental studies.  

So he is very well equipped to lead these proceedings and to 

introduce the extraordinary group of panelists who are the real 

stars of tonight’s event.  Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]   

BRIAN LEHRER  

And, Bob, thank you so much.  I so personally appreciate your 

commitment to public discourse at a high level.  We need much 

more of that in this country.  I would like to welcome you all 

formally to the sixth Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  Let me 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 4. 

 

 

 

give you a brief run-down of the evening.  First, the proposer of 

the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument.  

The opposition will follow.  Each person will get a maximum of 

eight minutes and we will go back and forth from one side to the 

other.  Second, when all six speakers are finished with their 

opening remarks I will do some follow-up questioning and open 

up the floor to brief questions from the audience.  And when I say 

brief, I do mean brief.  We have, we are limited to twenty minutes 

for the entire follow-up discussion after the eight minute 

presentations.  And so I ask that you limit your questions to 

thirty seconds and not give any speeches tonight and I will do the 

same in my follow-up questions.  Uh, third, when the Q and A is 

complete, each debater will make a final statement, not lasting 

more than two minutes per person.  And fourth, during the 

closing statements, uh, ballot boxes will be passed around for 

voting.  You have your tickets.  This is what the ballot box looks 

like and you will put in either the “for” piece, the “against” piece 

or the whole ticket if you still don’t know which side you favor.  If 

anyone does not have a ticket ballot – are you snickering at the 

very idea of being undecided or ambivalent?  This is what we’ve 

come to?  Um, an usher will get you a ballot at the appropriate 

moment if you still need one.  And fifth, and last, after the final 

closing statement is made I will announce the results of the 

audience vote and tell you which side carried the day.  Now, to

introduce the panel.  For the motion, author and filmmaker, best 

known as the author of Jurassic Park and the creator of E.R., 

Michael Crichton.  [APPLAUSE]  The Alfred P. Sloan Professor of 

Meteorology in the Department of Earth, Atmosphere and 

Planetary Sciences at MIT, Richard S. Lindzen.  [APPLAUSE]  And 

Emeritus Professor of Biogeography at the University of London, 

School of Oriental and African Studies, Philip Stott.  [APPLAUSE]   

Against the motion:  Climate Scientist at the Union of Concerned 

Scientists, Brenda Ekwurzel.  [APPLAUSE]  Climate Modeler at 

the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Gavin Schmidt.  

[APPLAUSE]  And distinguished Professor of, uh – I’m sorry.  And 

distinguished Professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 

University of California, San Diego – Richard C.J. Somerville.  

[APPLAUSE]  And that was all very polite.  I couldn’t tell how 

many people voted for or against the motion.  [LAUGHTER]  All 

right, first, for the motion:  Richard Lindzen.  Please go to the 

microphone.    

RICHARD S. LINDZEN 

Okay, I’d like to thank Intelligence Squared, the staff, Bob 

Rosenkranz, Brian Lehrer and of course, our worthy opponents, 

for the opportunity to debate the proposition:  Global warming is 

not a crisis.  Please keep in mind what the proposition is.  It is 

not a debate over whether the earth has been warming over the 

past century.  Uh, the earth is always warming or cooling, at least 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 6. 

 

 

 

a few tenths of a degree.  And we’re talking about, so far, 

something on the order of six tenths of a degree centigrade.  

We’re not even arguing about whether greenhouse gas emissions 

are contributing at some level to warming.  And they most 

certainly should or I would suggest it would be very little.  

Indeed, as far as I can tell, even our opponents do not claim that 

global warming is a crisis at present.  Rather, we are primarily 

addressing the future.  Now, much of the current alarm, I would 

suggest, is based on ignorance of what is normal for weather and 

climate.  Extreme weather events occur all the time.  There’s, 

there is really no evidence of systematic increases, judging from 

reports from bodies ranging from the National Hurricane Center 

to the U.N.’s Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change.  In 

fact, outside the tropics the theory of such storms and variability 

says that the variability should decrease in a warmer world.  

Thus, if this is a matter of crisis for where we live the world is in 

a permanent state of crisis and will be less prone to crisis in a 

warmer world.  Sea level has also been a matter of concern, I 

think largely because it’s very telegenic, as opposed to a half 

degree of temperature.  And sea level has been increasing since 

the end of the last Ice Age glaciation, with the most rapid change 

increase about twelve thousand years ago.  In recent centuries 

the rate has been relatively uniform, averaged over ten year 

periods.  Uh, it amounts to a couple of millimeters per year and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 7. 

 

 

 

this is residual of much larger positive and negative changes 

locally.  Uh, those changes are due to tectonics.  And, and the 

risk, if you’re worried about sea level change, from these changes 

is larger than it is from warming.  The impact of warming on 

agriculture is not easy to ascertain.  But, for example, India has 

warmed in the second half of the twentieth century and 

agricultural output has increased greatly.  The impact on disease 

seems dubious at best, according to articles in Lancet.  Infectious 

diseases like malaria are not so much a matter of temperature as 

of poverty and public health, most notably the elimination of 

DDT.  Malaria is still endemic in Siberia and was once so in 

Michigan.  Exposure, I would suggest, to cold is generally found 

to be both more dangerous and less comfortable.  Now, recently 

the IPCC summary for policy maker came out and it had an 

iconic claim about man’s impact on temperature change.  Uh, 

does this imply crisis?  Well, the impact on temperature per unit 

carbon dioxide actually goes down, not up, with increasing CO2.  

Uh, the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gases is not directly 

related to the emissions rate or even CO2 levels, which is what 

the legislation is hitting on, but rather to the impact of these 

gases on the greenhouse effect.  Uh, modelers use double CO2 as 

a convenient benchmark and on the basis of current models, it’s 

claimed that this should lead to about one and a half to four and 

a half degrees warming.  What is less often noted is in terms of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 8. 

 

 

 

greenhouse forcing we’re already three quarters of the way to that 

doubling.  And we’ve only seen point six degrees.  And there’s no 

reason to suppose, furthermore, that this is all due to man.  Now, 

this certainly does not support the model forecasts upon which 

alarm is based.  Modelers commonly claim it’s still possible that 

aerosols have canceled much of the greenhouse warming.   

Unfortunately, the impact of aerosols is considered by the IPCC 

to be virtually unknown.  And indeed, many people consider that 

canceling the warming involves a larger effect than seems 

plausible.  There have also been claims that warming has been 

delayed by the ocean.  But the results I’ve mentioned are from 

coupled models involving the atmosphere in the ocean.  And in 

many of these the oceans have been tuned to have particularly 

long delays.  And I think it’s crucial to distinguish between the 

claim that models can display past behavior from the actual 

situation, which is that models can be adjusted to display past 

behavior once that behavior is known.  There is no reason to 

suppose that the adjustment corrected the relevant error.  It is 

worth adding that warming, instead of accelerating, has been 

essentially absent for about the last ten years.  So the iconic 

statement is itself not indicative of crisis.  And one could, if one 

had time, explain why the iconic statement itself may very well 

not be true.  The major defense of the statement is modelers 

cannot think of anything else that gave warming over the last 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 9. 

 

 

 

thirty years.  But these are the same models that cannot account 

for the Medieval warm period, or for that matter, even do a good 

job of replicating El Nino.  So even the basis for the iconic 

statement is not particularly meaningful.  So crisis is not a 

product of current observations.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

[OVERLAP]  One.    

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

I suggest it’s not even a product of projections.  Now, there is no 

reason to suppose that anything will cause a threshold to change 

this assessment.  We’re still talking about a two per cent 

imbalance and we’re also talking about the impact of CO2 per 

unit CO2 that decreases.  This is not the usual condition for a 

threshold.  Moreover, there are positive reasons to suspect that 

greenhouse warming is not significant.  The real signature of 

greenhouse warming is not surface temperature but temperature 

in the middle of the troposphere, about five kilometers.  And that 

is going up even slower than the temperature at the surface. 

Finally, the underlying present concern is not the greenhouse 

effect, per se.  Doubling CO2 by itself only gives you one degree 

warming.  The --   

BRIAN LEHRER  

[OVERLAP]  Richard Lindzen, thank you very much for your 

opening statement.

RICHARD S. LINDZEN 

[OVERLAP]  Okay.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

I do have to cut you off there.  [APPLAUSE]  By the way, 

audience, you may feel free to, to applaud.  Uh, you can give 

polite applause, you can give enthusiastic applause.  Uh, that is 

your right.  Of course, we ask that nobody shout anything out.  

Richard Somerville, the next statement is yours.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE 

The motion before us, global warming is not a crisis, means we 

ought to know what crisis means.  The word does not mean 

catastrophe or alarmism.  It means a crucial or decisive moment, 

a turning point, a state of affairs in which a decisive change for 

better or worse is imminent.  We are talking about the future 

here.  The entire world now really does have a critical choice to 

make.  It is whether to continue on the present path of adding 

more and more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the 

atmosphere or whether to find another path.  We’re speaking of 

the future.  And science tells us that the path we choose will 

largely determine what kind of earth our children and 

grandchildren will inherit.  Our task tonight is to persuade you 

that global warming is indeed a crisis in exactly that precise 

sense so you should vote against the motion.  The science 

community today has impeccable settled science, despite what 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 11. 

 

 

 

you have just heard, that demonstrates the reality of global 

warming and its primary origin in human activities.  We fully 

understand the fundamental physics behind the greenhouse 

effect.  We also now have persuasive observational evidence of 

dramatic changes already taking place in the climate system, 

changes that are not in any sense small.  Mankind’s fingerprints 

have now clearly emerged above the noise of natural variability.  

That is the primary message of the intergovernmental panel, 

climate panel, the panel on climate change report that Professor 

Lindzen referred to – the IPCC.  We also have powerful tools to 

prode…project many aspects of the future climate with 

considerable confidence.  We take into account other important 

factors besides greenhouse gases – the sun, volcanoes, pollution 

particles.  Some of our forecasts have already come true.  A group 

of people dispute these consensus findings of mainstream 

scientists.  Call them contrarians.  Some are here in this very 

room.  Contrarians are not unique to climate.  They exist in many 

fields of science.  There are a few retrovirus experts, fully 

credentialed, who don’t think that HIV causes AIDS.  The New 

Yorker this week, many of you will have seen, writes about them.  

When the revolution of continental drift was sweeping through 

geology and geophysics, some imminent earth scientists couldn’t 

be persuaded that plate tectonics were real. Continents can 

move.  These contrarians were mistaken.  They faded from the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 12. 

 

 

 

scene.  Experience, long experience shows that in science it tends 

to be the rare exception rather than the rule when a lone genius 

eventually prevails over conventional mainstream scientific 

thought.  An occasional Galileo does come along or an Einstein.  

Not often.  Most people who think they’re a Galileo are just 

wrong.  [LAUGHTER]  We’re talking here about managing risk for 

the future.  It’s a big risk to the planet to bet it on the 

contrarians.  Here’s a brief look at some of what we know.  The 

IPC said…C said, quote:  Warming of the climate system is 

unequivocal, unquote -- based on many kinds of observations.  

Also our knowledge of ancient climates tells us that the warmth 

of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous 

three…thirteen hundred years.  The IPC said…C said, Most of the 

observed increase in global av…globally averaged temperatures in 

recent decades is very likely due to the observed increase in 

human caused greenhouse gas concentrations.  These are 

summary conclusions of, of experts.  In a painstaking process, 

lasting, uh, years with thirty thousand reviewer comments, each 

log numbered responded to by teams of experts who represent, 

um, the mainstream science and who take into account views 

from the fringes as well.  There’s never been as thorough and 

vetted a process for summarizing science precisely for the point 

of making input to policy makers.  Nothing said here tonight in a 

few minutes that we have can possibly undermine, uh, this 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 13. 

 

 

 

powerful statement from the scientific community.  We also 

project a further warming of a half a degree Fahrenheit for the 

next twenty-five years.  Beyond that it does depend largely on 

how much more CO2 and other greenhouse gases humanity 

dumps into the atmosphere.  Global warming since the 

nineteenth century is already more than a degree Fahrenheit.  It’s 

continuing.  Of the twelve warmest years in the instrumental 

record, uh, eleven of them have occurred in the most recent 

twelve years globally.  2006 was the sixth warmest year in this 

record globally and the warmest year of all in the U.S.  Arctic 

temperatures in the last hundred years increased twice as much 

as the global average.  Since 1950 the number of heat waves 

globally has increased.  The heat wave in Europe in 2003 that 

killed more than thirty thousand people was unprecedented in 

modern times. Intense tropical cyclone activity, the IPCC 

concludes, has increased in the North Atlantic region since about 

1970.  The global ocean, down to a depth of at least six thousand 

feet, has been warming since the early 1960s.  This warming is 

contributing to sea level rise.  It’s by no means all vestiges of the 

last Ice Age.  Sea level rose some seven inches over the twentieth 

century.  The rate of rise has apparently increased recently.  

Water vapor in the atmosphere, as predicted, is increasing as the 

world warms.  This additional water feeds back.  It’s a 

greenhouse gas.  It amplifies the warming.  It’s as though you 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 14. 

 

 

 

had your house wired funny so that when it got warm the 

thermostat turned on the furnace and made it warmer still.  

Snow cover and mountain glaciers are decreasing markedly.  It’s 

a long list.  The list goes on.  None of these observational facts is 

a surprise to the climate science community.  They are what we 

had predicted.  We scientists have been expecting measurements 

like these and now we see them.  The question for the future is 

simply how much worse do we, do we intend?  How much more 

severe, uh, will we let these trends become?  The science warns 

us that continuing to fuel the world using present technology will 

bring dangerous and possibly surprising climate changes by the 

end of this century, if not sooner.  Business as usual implies 

more heat waves, higher sea levels, disrupted rainfall patterns, 

vanishing glaciers and much more.  Limiting carbon dioxide 

amounts to any reasonable level will take large cuts in emissions.  

It takes time.   We have a giant intra… infrastructure based on 

fossil fuels.  To have a meaningful effect by mid-century we need 

to start soon.  The question is really whether humanity has the 

collective determination to act in any meaningful way.  The 

economic case can be made convincingly, once people 

understand the cost of doing nothing or too little.  It’s like elective 

surgery.  It’s, uh, not free to decline it.  Technology can 

accomplish great things once society is committed to such a goal.  

We know now that humanity has already increased atmospheric 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 15. 

 

 

 

carbon dioxide by thirty-five per cent above natural levels.  And 

humanity, as a group, by default or on purpose, will now decide 

what level it wants to tolerate.  Then, after humanity has made 

this decision, how much CO2 do you want in your children and 

grandchildren’s atmosphere?, which –  

BRIAN LEHRER 

[OVERLAP]  One.    

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

…after that, nature will have its say and the climate system will 

change in response to the level of greenhouse gases in the 

atmosphere.  Nature is superbly indifferent to politics and, and 

spin.  But it will have the last word, uh, in this debate.  I have a 

few seconds and I’ll say a few words about the IPCC.  I’ve been a 

coordinating lead author in it, uh, for three years.  I’ve, I was in 

Paris last month when this summary was negotiated and 

released.  It’s an extraordinarily impressive international 

collaboration -- thirty thousand review comments, a hundred and 

fifty, uh, authors – seventy-five per cent of whom, by the way, 

were new to the process.  We’re not a clique defending what we 

said six years ago.  And I urge you to familiarize yourself with the 

science because the science here has spoken very plainly.  Thank 

you.  [APPLAUSE]    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Thank you, Richard Somerville.  Michael Crichton, you have the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 16. 

 

 

 

next statement.   

MICHAEL CRICHTON 

The microphone goes up.  [LAUGHTER]  Before I begin I want to 

just say one brief thing about what Richard has just told you.  

He’s, he’s giving you the story of plate tectonics but it’s 

fascinating.  He’s turned it upside down.  He’s turned it on its 

head.  The story of plate tectonics actually is the story of one 

person who had the right idea – Alfred Wegener.  He had it in 

1912.  And it is the story of major scientists at Harvard and 

elsewhere opposing him for decade after decade until finally it 

was proven to be incorrect what they were believing.  So it is, in 

fact -- when I was a kid I was told the continents didn’t move.  It 

is, in fact, perfectly possible for the consensus of scientists to be 

wrong and it is, in fact, perfectly possible for small numbers of 

people to be in opposition and they will be ultimately be proven 

true.  [APPLAUSE]  I want to address the issue of crisis in a 

somewhat different way.  Does it really matter if we have a crisis 

at all?  I mean, haven’t we actually raised temperatures so much 

that we, as stewards of the planet, have to act?  These are the 

questions that friends of mine ask as they are getting on board 

their private jets to fly to their second and third homes.  

[LAUGHTER]  And I would like, with their permission, to take the 

question just a little bit more seriously.  I myself, uh, just a few 

years ago, held the kinds of views that I, uh, expect most of you 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 17. 

 

 

 

in this room hold.  That’s to say, I had a very conventional view 

about the environment.  I thought it was going to hell.  I thought 

human beings were responsible and I thought we had to do 

something about it.  I hadn’t actually looked at any 

environmental issues in detail but I have that general view.  And 

so in 2000, when I read an article that suggested that the 

evidence for global warming might not be quite as firm as people 

said, I immediately dismissed it.  Not believe in global warming?  

That’s ridiculous.  How could you have such an idea?  Are you 

going to try and tell me that the planet isn’t getting warmer?  I 

know it’s getting warmer.  I grew up in Long Island.  And when I 

was a kid we always had days off from school for hurricanes.  

There are no hurricanes on Long Island now.  I spent thirty years 

in California.  We used to have something called June gloom.  

Now it’s more like May, June, July, August gloom with 

September, October, November gloom added in.  The weather is 

very different.  However, because I look for trouble, um, I went at 

a certain point and started looking at the temperature records.  

And I was very surprised at what I found.  The first thing that I 

discovered, which Dick has already told you, is that the increase 

in temperatures so far over the last hundred years, is on the 

order of six-tenths of a degree Celsius, about a degree 

Fahrenheit.  I hadn’t really thought, when we talked about global 

warming, about how much global warming really was taking 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 18. 

 

 

 

place.  The second thing I discovered was that everything is a 

concern about the future and the future is defined by models.  

The models tell us that human beings are the cause of the 

warming, that human beings, uh, producing all this CO2, are 

what’s actually driving the climate warming that we’re seeing 

now.  But I was interested to see that the models, as far as I 

could tell, were not really reliable.  That is to say, that past 

estimates have proven incorrect.  Uh, in 1988, when James 

Hanson talked to the Congress and said that global warming had 

finally arrived, The New York Times published a model result that 

suggested that in the next hundred years there would be twelve 

degrees Celsius increase.  A few years later the increase was 

estimated to be six degrees, then four degrees.  The most recent 

U.N. estimate is three degrees.  Will it continue to go down?  I 

expect so.  And this left me in a kind of a funny position.  But let 

me first be clear about exactly what I’m saying.  Is the globe 

warming?  Yes.  Is the greenhouse effect real?  Yes.  Is carbon 

dioxide, a greenhouse gas, being increased by men?  Yes.  Would 

we expect this warming to have an effect?  Yes.  Do human 

beings in general effect the climate?  Yes.  But none of that 

answers the core question of whether or not carbon dioxide is the 

contemporary driver for the warming we’re seeing.  And as far as 

I could tell scientists had, had postulated that but they hadn’t 

demonstrated it.  So I’m kinda stranded here.  I’ve got half a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 19. 

 

 

 

degree of warming, models that I don’t think are reliable.  And 

what, how am I going to think about the future?  I reasoned in 

this way:  if we’re going to have one degree increase, maybe if, if, 

climate doesn’t change and if, uh, and if there’s no change in 

technology – but of course, if you don’t imagine there will be a 

change in technology in the next hundred years you’re a very 

unusual person.  And I also was aware that we have actually 

been starting to do exactly the kind of thing that we ought to do, 

which is to decarbonize.  Jesse Ausubel at Rockefeller University 

points out, for example, that starting about a hundred and fifty 

years ago, in the time of Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria, we 

began to move from wood to coal, from coal to oil, from oil to 

natural gas and so on.  Decreasing our carbon, increasing our 

hydrogen makes perfect sense, makes environmental sense, 

makes political sense, makes geopolitical sense.  And we’ll 

continue to do it without any legislation, without any, anything 

forcing us to do it, as nothing forced us to get off horses.  Well, if 

this is the situation, I suddenly think about my friends, you 

know, getting on their private jets.  And I think, well, you know, 

maybe they have the right idea.  Maybe all that we have to do is 

mouth a few platitudes, show a good, you know, expression of 

concern on our faces, buy a Prius, drive it around for a while and 

give it to the maid, attend a few fundraisers and you’re done.  

Because, actually, all anybody really wants to do is talk about it.

They don’t actually do anything.  [SOMEONE CHUCKLES IN 

BACKGROUND]  And the evidence for that is the number of 

major leaders in climate who clearly have no intention of 

changing their lifestyle, reducing their own consumption or 

getting off private jets themselves.  If they’re not willing to do it 

why should anybody else?  [APPLAUSE]  Is talking enough?  I 

mean, is, is -- the talking cure of the environment, it didn’t work 

in psychology.  It won’t work in the environment either.  

[LAUGHTER]  Is that enough to do?  I don’t think so.  I think it’s 

totally inadequate. Everyday 30,000 people on this planet die of 

the diseases of poverty. There are, a third of the planet doesn’t 

have electricity. We have a billion people with no clean water, we 

have half a billion people going to bed hungry every night. Do we 

care about this? It seems that we don’t. It seems that we would 

rather look a hundred years into the future than pay attention to 

what’s going on now. I think that's unacceptable. I think that’s 

really a disgrace.  

BRIAN LEHRER

MICHAEL CRICHTON  

This doesn’t need to happen. We’re allowing it to happen. And I 

don’t know what’s wrong with the rich self-centered societies that 

we live in in the west that we are not paying attention to the 

conditions of the wider world. And it does seem to me that if we 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 21. 

 

 

 

use arguments about the environment to turn our back on the 

sick and the dying of our shared world, and that's our excuse to 

ignore them, then we have done a true and terrible thing. And it’s 

awful, thank you.  

[APPLAUSE]  

BRIAN LEHRER  

Thank you Michael Crichton. Gavin Schmidt, you have the 

podium next.  

GAVIN SCHMIDT 

Thank you. I want to talk to you a little about the nature of this 

public debate. And I want to give you some background to what 

you’ve been hearing so far, and what you’ll hear a little bit later 

on. The issue of global warming and whether it’s a crisis or not, is 

in fact a scientific decision, it’s a scientific issue. It’s not a 

political one. On the other hand, deciding what to do about it is 

obviously political. Science can inform those decisions, but it 

can’t determine what decisions society makes. But we’re here to 

debate the existence of the problem and whether it is a crisis. 

That's something that the scientists on this side are eminently 

suited to do. You’ve all seen or heard about the CSI police drama, 

where high tech forensic scientists try and work out who done it 

when they come across the scene of a crime. Well think of climate 

scientists as CSI planet Earth, we’re try-, we see a climate change 

and we try and work out what’s done it. Just like on CSI we have 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 22. 

 

 

 

a range of high tech instruments to give us clues, satellites, 

ocean probes, radar, a worldwide network of weather stations 

and sophisticated computer programs to help us make sense of it 

all. The aim is to come to the most likely explanation of all the 

facts fully anticipating that in the real world there are always 

going to be anomalies, there are always going to be uncertainties. 

Conclusions will be preliminary and always open to revision in 

the light of new evidence. If this all sounds familiar, it’s because 

it’s exactly the same approach that doctors take when examining 

a patient. They don’t know everything about the human body, 

but they can still make a pretty accurate diagnosis of your 

illness. We end up then with a hierarchy of knowledge. Some 

things that are extremely likely, some things we’re pretty sure of, 

and some things that we think might be true, but really could go 

either way. There isn’t a division into things that are completely 

proven and things which are completely unknown. Instead, you 

have a sliding scale of increasing confidence. Let me give you a 

few examples. We’re highly confident that the sun is gonna rise 

tomorrow, it might not, it might go nova. But it’s likely that it will 

happen. It’s quite likely that you’ll be able to get a cab home from 

this event, unless it’s raining of course. [LAUGHTER] But, but 

those two things have different levels of certainty. You’re used to 

the idea that different kinds of knowledge come with different 

levels of certainty, and that’s exactly what we’re talking about 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 23. 

 

 

 

when we talk about the impacts of climate change. Going back to 

being climate detectives, we’re certain that carbon dioxide and 

methane are greenhouse gases and they’ve increased because of 

human activity. We’re very confident that the planet has been 

warming up, and we’re pretty sure that the other things that are 

going on, changes to the sun, changes to particles in the air, 

changes to ozone have made some difference but aren’t 

dominant. The physics tells us that this is a very consistent 

picture. Our suspects, the greenhouse gases, had both the 

opportunity and the means to cause this climate change and 

they’re very likely guilty. And they are increasing faster than ever. 

Now, the lawyers get involved. Lawyers are paid to present a 

certain case regardless of its merits and they do that by 

challenging everything in the case, and if one argument doesn’t 

work, well, they’ll just move on to the next. This procedure works 

very well when the proposition being debated is very binary, a 

yes, no. Is the subspe-, is the suspect guilty, uh should he go 

free, should he go to jail? It is designed specifically to prevent 

significant action in the face of uncertainty. If there is still 

reasonable doubt, the suspect gets acquitted even if you still 

think that they did it. But contrast that with the scientists. They 

want to know the most likely explanation. The lawyers, they want 

to win the case. In their own domains both ways of finding out 

things are very useful, it’s only when they come together in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 24. 

 

 

 

situations like this that things get tricky. Particularly when 

scientific results are perceived to have economic or moral 

implications, it’s common for political debates to get shifted into 

the scientific arena. It makes the political argument seem much 

more scientific and therefore logical. But since the basic 

disagreement is still political, this is a disaster for any kind of 

action. So tonight, you’re not gonna hear us arguing about 

obscure details in climate science, if you have any questions, I 

have a web site realclimate.org, you can go and check that out 

and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you might have. But 

here we’re gonna talk about the bigger picture. Let me give you a 

few examples of how that works. Creationists have argued that 

the eye is too complex to have evolved. Not because they care 

about the evolution of eyes, but because they see the 

implications of evolution as somehow damaging to their world 

view. If you demonstrate the evolution of eyes, their world view 

won’t change, they’ll just move onto something else. Another 

example, when CFCs from aerosol cans and air conditioners were 

found to be depleting the ozone layer, the CEO of DuPont, the 

main manufacturer argued that because CFCs were heavier than 

air, they couldn’t possibly get up to the ozone layer. So there was 

no need to regulate them, that was pure fantasy, but it sounded 

scientific. Again, tobacco companies spent millions trying to show 

that nicotine delayed the onset of Alzheimer’s because that was a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 25. 

 

 

 

distraction from the far more solid case that, that linked tobacco 

to lung cancer. That was a distraction and a red herring. These 

arguments are examples of pseudo debates, scientific sounding 

points that are designed not to fool the experts, but to sow 

confusion and doubt in the minds of the lay public. This is a 

deliberate strategy and you’re hearing it here tonight. So during 

this debate, let’s play a little game. I’ll call it spot the fallacy. 

Every time that you hear the other side claim that we are 

predicting an imminent catastrophe, give yourself one point. 

Every time you hear an anecdote used to refute a general trend, 

that’s cherry picking and we heard that already, uh give yourself 

another. And every time you hear there’s a lag between carbon 

dioxide and temperature in the ice cores, give yourself two points 

because that’s a real doosy.  

BRIAN LEHRER  

One.  

GAVIN SCHMIDT 

So far this evening we’re running at about two red herrings, two 

complete errors, three straw men and one cherry pick. 

[LAUGHTER] So see how you do and we’ll compare notes at the 

end. Scientists have to be professional skeptics, right, they are 

trained not to take new information at face value, they have to 

ask where measurements come from and what they could 

possibly mean. They have to be dispassionate about the data, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 26. 

 

 

 

and just see where it leads. Once you start making logically 

fallacious arguments in order to support a predetermined 

position, you are no longer acting as a scientist, you are acting as 

a lawyer, however scientific sounding you might seem. Despite 

that natural skepticism, the national academies of all eight, G8 

countries, all the major scientific societies, even the White House 

have agreed with a scientific consensus on this matter, which 

pointedly did not happen in the 1970s by the way. Michael 

Crichton for one has frequently stated the 

consensus…..[OVERLAP]   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Gavin Schmidt, thank you very much.   

[APPLAUSE]  

BRIAN LEHRER  

Philip Stott, you have the podium next.  

PHILIP STOTT 

Brian may I just take one second to thank very much the 

Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared for having the 

great courtesy to invite me over from London to participate in this 

very exciting set of debates. Thank you also to all my colleagues 

for their contribution and above all to the audience for I’m sure, 

gonna be exciting participation as well. I want to start exactly 

with the consensus word that was used by Richard. Can I just 

remind you he wanted an example. In the early 20th century, 95% 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 27. 

 

 

 

of scientists believe in eugenics. [LAUGHTER] Science does not 

progress by consensus, it progresses by falsification and by what 

we call paradigm shifts. And in my, riposte [UNCLEAR] I’ll be 

coming to a paradigm shift that could actually throw the whole of 

what that other side is saying through the window. But that's 

later. [LAUGHTER] What I want to come to now is the 1970s that 

Robert Rosenkranz quite correctly reminded us of. Because then 

a crisis was announced. And I want to quote from three 

newspapers. The Christian Science Monitor, “Warning, Earth’s 

climate is changing faster than even experts expect.” I really like 

that. Your own New York Times, “A major cooling of the climate is 

widely inevitable.” And in Newsweek, back to consensus, 

“Meteorologists are almost unanimous that catastrophic famines 

will result from global cooling.” That was the 1970s. And there 

are many headlines. And what I would like to stress is, it was a 

stress on consensus, it was faster than expected, the evidence 

came from the oceans, from polar bears, it’s always polar bears, 

from the changing seasons and it’s always disaster. Why do we 

believe them now? And what is important in this I think is to 

remember what that first Earth Day claimed. The first Earth Day 

in America claimed the following, that because of global cooling, 

the population of America would have collapsed to 22 million by 

the year 2000. And of the average calorie intake of the average 

American would be wait for this, 2,400 calories, would good it 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 28. 

 

 

 

were. [LAUGHTER] It’s nonsense and very dangerous. And what 

we have fundamentally forgotten is simple primary school 

science. Climate always changes. It is always as Dick said 

warming or cooling, it’s never stable. And if it were stable it would 

actually be interesting scientifically because it would be the first 

time for four and a half billion years. [LAUGHTER] Second, 

humans have been influencing climate for a million years as 

hominids, from the first hominid that set fire to the Savanna 

grasslands in Africa, when particulates and gases started to rise 

and they changed the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth. It’s a 

long relationship. So the debate, is climate changing and are 

humans affecting climate change is actually nearly irrelevant. 

The answers are yes and yes, and always will be. What is really 

crucial in all this is something that none of the scientists or none 

of the politicians want you really to hear. Climate is the most 

complex system we know governed by thousands of factors, I 

haven’t time to list them. But the point is, it’s like in my country, 

Glasgow on a Saturday night, chaos. [LAUGHTER] And what 

we’re trying to do is manage it by dealing with one pub. One. And 

it just won’t work, that’s the danger. In such a system, doing 

something at the margins and not doing something in the 

margins are equally unpredictable. And the question we should 

be asking our politicians are, what climate are you actually 

aiming to produce and when we get there won’t it change 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 29. 

 

 

 

anyway? The crisis is therefore in ourselves and if we are 

rejecting this and I ask you passionately to do so for the next two 

more important reasons, our uh, political agenda as Michael 

hinted is wrong. There are two great crises in the world of which 

the biggest unquestionably is four billion people in poverty. And 

this topic is an ecocondria of our rich selves, London, New York 

and Washington. It’s about us and about our hypochondria 

about the world. If you actually have clean water, you have 

modern energy, you will cope with change whatever it is, hot, wet, 

cold or dry. I’m a left wing critic of global warming because the 

agenda is fundamentally wrong and dangerous. And believe you 

me, neither Republican nor Democrat will do anything about it, 

because our second crisis is a crisis of hypocrisy. Now Michael 

hinted at this, but I come from Europe which has been lecturing 

the world on this subject. Let me tell you, the hypocrisy in 

Europe is absolutely mind blowing, I am embarrassed. 

[LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] The latest statistic from the 

Environment Agency in Europe will predict under the Kyoto 

Protocol we won’t even be minus, that by 2012, we’ll be plus four 

percent. And did you know that island whom we all love actually 

under the Kyoto Protocol is allowed a growth of 13%? And some 

of the figures for the, for Europe are just spectacularly worrying. 

Spain, Italy, Portugal, we’re in the 40 percentile. And yet we 

lecture the world. What we see in this is an enormous danger for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 30. 

 

 

 

politicians in terms of their hypocrisy. I’m not going to say 

anything about Al Gore and his house. [LAUGHTER] But it is a 

very serious point. Global warming is also dangerous because I 

am an environmentalist, but what I’m beginning to see is that 

global warming is setting age-, agendas which are actually 

damaging for the environment. Bio fuels in which the energy 

relationships are very dodgy, but which have a very significant 

effect certainly in my country on biodiversity. What is more, we’re 

having wind farms placed for global warming on very, very 

sensitive peatmoor habitats. Don’t think therefore that if you’re 

an environmentalist, you have to be attached to this agenda. 

Because it is now overarching, overdominant and is actually 

taking money and effort away from genuine and real on the 

ground habitat……[OVERLAP]   

BRIAN LEHRER  

One.  

PHILIP STOTT 

…..environmental concerns. But let me end with two images. 

Angela Merkel the German chancellor, my own good prime 

minister for whom I voted let me emphasize, arguing in public 

two weeks ago as to who in Annie get the gun style could produce 

the best temperature.  “I could do two degrees C said Angela,” 

“No, I could only do three said Tony.” [LAUGHTER] Stand back a 

minute, those are politicians, telling you that they can control 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 31. 

 

 

 

climate to a degree Celsius. This is a political crisis, not a crisis 

as put here, and I ask you passionately to vote against it. And 

Samuel Johnson and James Thurber, I have to end with Thurber 

because of the New Yorker. Samuel Johnson, the great 

lexicographer talked of a, in Russia last talked to an astronomer 

who thought he could control the sun and the 

clouds….[OVERLAP]   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Philip Stott.  

PHILIP STOTT 

….he was mad.  

BRIAN LEHRER 

Thank you very much.  

PHILIP STOTT 

I can’t get Thurber in, thank you.  

[APPLAUSE]  

BRIAN LEHRER  

Brenda Ekwurzel, the podium is yours.  

BRENDA EKWURZEL 

I’d like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation, to all of you for 

taking time to discuss this urgent topic. Uh, Gavin Schmidt, like 

in the climate scientists to forensics team of the CSI, uh another 

metaphor that applies is that of a doctor. And studying global 

warming is like taking the Earth’s temperature. We’ve seen that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 32. 

 

 

 

it’s rising, and also we have diagnosed the dominant cause of this 

fever is the heat trapping emissions from human activity. So far 

temperatures have gone up about over a degree, point, one point 

four degrees Fahrenheit. That doesn’t mean much to our 

everyday lives, but it means everything to the Earth. All of us 

have experienced 100 degree temperature, a hundred and two 

degree temperature, but we’ve survived. Now the body cannot 

withstand 107 degree Fahrenheit temperature. That’s about an 

eight degree jump above the average body temperature. Now 

when it comes to the Earth, the Earth is much more fragile than 

the body when it comes to temperature. What we see is that a 

seven degree increase in global warming would mean that we 

would accelerate, we would intensify the water cycle, that means 

the wet places will get wetter and the dry places will get drier. It 

means we put at risk species that are gonna go extinct. It means 

that the summer arctic ice is at risk of disappearing. It also 

means that a seven degree rise in temperature would commit us 

to substantial sea level rise from melting of the Greenland ice 

sheet. The Earth’s fever is only getting worse and the animals and 

the plants that are out there struggling are already giving us the 

early warning signs. We’ve seen them shift their habitats and 

we’ve seen them struggle as they cope with the shifting of the 

period, the warm periods and the cold periods of the seasons. 

Furthermore, there’s already heat in the pipeline as the oceans 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 33. 

 

 

 

play catch-up to the atmosphere loading that we’ve put, these 

heat trapping gases in our atmosphere. As the oceans warm up, 

the temperatures will commit us to further warming. We’re 

locking in another degree of Fahrenheit of warming. That’s heat 

in the pipeline. Do we really want to lock in even further 

warming? We’re going to keep studying the symptoms of scie-, as 

scientists. But the diagnosis is very clear and the course of 

treatment is even clearer. Choosing not to fight global warming is 

as foolhardy as ignoring the early warning signs of a fever of a 

young child and not attending to that. So what is the course of 

treatment and can we really do something about it? The answer 

is yes, but we have to act soon, we have to start tackling this 

problem on all fronts. Our landfills, farms, and livestock are 

emitting methane and other heat trapping gases. Our fossil fuels, 

our oil, our coal, our gas, cutting down forests, are committing us 

to ever increasing levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, in 

fact, these levels of heat trapping gases are at the highest level 

than they’ve ever been for hundreds of thousands of years. It’s 

not natural. Since the dawn of the industrial age, humans have 

been digging up carbon and putting it on fire, and using it as 

energy. Now the Earth doesn’t normally set on fire million year ol-

, million year old stores of carbon, it’s unnatural. It’s not, it’s not 

a normal thing. What we’re doing by using these fossil fuels is 

overwhelming the Earth’s capacity to clean up and absorb that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 34. 

 

 

 

carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The Earth takes hundreds 

of years to get rid of carbon dioxide and what’s most important, is 

that this fact is very important to help us decide when we have to 

start acting about global warming.  While some of the worst 

effects might not be felt for decades or centuries the actions we 

take today will determine how much carbon dioxide will be in the 

atmosphere, how much global warming we are locking in, how 

bad are the effects going to be for ourselves and for our children 

and grandchildren.  That’s what’s really important.  We probably 

have a decade to institute meaningful solutions.  Why ten years?  

That’s because the decisions we make today have a long term 

commitment.  If we do not reform our agriculture practices heat 

trapping gases will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere.  

However, if we were to capture methane from our landfills, not 

only would we stop those emissions from going to the 

atmosphere, we would also be creating energy at the same time.  

If we make a building in the old way then we would be polluting 

for decades to come.  However, if we were to build with renewable 

energy sources new cleaner buildings then that means that we 

have eliminated that fossil fuel loading of emissions to the 

atmosphere.  If we construct coal power plants the conventional 

way that means we are substantially increasing the heat trapping 

emissions in our atmosphere for fifty years and they will linger for 

many, many more years.  However, if we invest in research and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 35. 

 

 

 

technology to capture carbon from those coal plants this will 

would be welcome news to all the nations of the world that have 

deep, vast coal reserves.  Increasing energy efficiency and 

harnessing renewable energy from the sun, from the wind, from 

other sources will help us along this path.  If our cities continue 

to grow, that increase the commuting distance of our citizens, 

that means we are committing ourselves to burning more fuel.  

There are better ways.  With profitable solutions at hand it’s 

irresponsible to postpone action.  Right now we could put nations 

on target to reducing emissions.  If we start now we reduce each 

year.  However, if we delay that means that the cuts that we have 

to make to meet our goals will become steeper and steeper and 

we may not even be able to meet those demands.  They will 

become too hard for us to reach.  It’s the equivalent to the person 

with a credit card who can no longer pay off the minimum 

payments, that cannot reach their goals.  Right now we’re on a 

spending spree with our heat trapping emissions.   We’re building 

up the future costs of global warming.  And –  

BRIAN LEHRER 

[OVERLAP]  One.    

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

And when this bill comes, uh, when the bill for our emissions 

today comes, comes due in the not too distant future, um, 

choosing not to fight global warming is about as irresponsible as 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 36. 

 

 

 

not making payments on a high interest credit card.  With such 

high stakes common sense requires that we act now and while we 

still have options.  Um, within the next decade we will continue to 

determine whether or not our children and grandchildren look 

back at this time and decide whether we failed them.  Or will they 

look back at this time and see that built a better planet for 

ourselves and for them?  We have a chance to avert this crisis 

and to assure a safer planet.  And if we wait for the children to 

solve this problem it’s too late.  The risks are too big.  But before 

we act on the global warming –

each side of the auditorium will come to you with a microphone 

when you raise your hands.  I will be looking for, from you, 

challenging questions for the pro side and for the anti side.   Uh, 

if you can identify yourselves that way, uh, to the people with the 

microphones that would be good.  Um, if some of you don’t fit 

into that category that’s okay too.  Uh, we’re gonna mix in my 

questions and your questions and to the panelists, um, I hope to 

keep a good pace here because by the rules we have 20 minutes 

only, and there is so much to follow up on.  Also…audience 

members, uh, please do not start to ask your question until you 

have a microphone.   please make your questions short and to 

the point, please, 30 seconds if you can, and, the more focused 

your question, the more likely you are to be on NPR.  So—

Richard Lindzen.  Can I get the two of you to engage for up to two 

minutes on one thing I noticed in your conversations, in your 

presentations, um…  Richard Lindzen, you seemed to say that 

warming could make the climate more stable.   Brenda, you 

seemed to suggest, that it would make it less stable.  Richard 

Lindzen, I’ll start with you, and talk to each other.  Are you

But it’s the climate that we have adapted to, it’s the climate that 

has led us to put—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN 

It may be—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT 

—Battery Park City right at the waterline, that’s the problem—    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Gavin Schmidt, thank you, let him, let him—  [LAUGHTER]  Hang 

on, hang on, hang on, well—  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]  Let him 

finish your thought, go ahead, Richard Lindzen—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN 

What I was referring to was the issue of variability.  And that 

depends basically on the pole-to-equator temperature difference.  

And since the models are suggesting that the warming would be 

greater at the poles, then you are reducing the equator to pole-

temperature difference, you’re increasing the—decreasing the 

forcing for storms, and you’re decreasing the range.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Brenda Ekwurzel?   

BRENDA EKWURZEL 

Yes, I think the risks are gonna grow, we know this with the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 39. 

 

 

 

warming of the planet further.  And furthermore, if we have those 

risks that means that governments are gonna spend much more 

money, hand over fist, bailing out farmers that are suffering from 

more extreme draught, we have arable lands growing—   

PHILIP STOTT 

Look—    

BRENDA EKWURZEL 

—uh, stuff like this—   

PHILIP STOTT 

But they’d have less water source—   

BRENDA EKWURZEL 

—this is gonna be—and less money for fighting poverty and all 

those other aspects that are important—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Philip Stott, you wanted to get in here?   

PHILIP STOTT 

Just to say I did find Gavin’s comment a little amusing because 

in fact 8,000 years ago, at a peak of warming much higher than 

today, you know  what the climate people call it?  The climate 

optimum.  In other words it’s actually perceived as more optimal 

in terms of vegetation and other factors.    

GAVIN SCHMIDT 

Not for people who own—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 40. 

 

 

 

BRIAN LEHRER 

Gavin, go ahead and respond.   

GAVIN SCHMIDT 

Not for people who own basement property in Battery Park City.  

[LAUGHTER]    

BRIAN LEHRER  

A low-lying area of New York City for those of you living…  

[LAUGHTER]  around the country.    

PHILIP STOTT 

But I think that raises a really interesting issue because of 

course adaptation to change is always the way that humans have 

coped with it, in fact of course bad planning and bad building 

doesn’t excuse and is not proof of global warming.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Here’s a question for the anti side.  [APPLAUSE]  A question for 

the anti side if I might, these 1970s headlines about global 

cooling.  That always comes up as an inconvenient fact.  I’ve 

almost got a title there.  [LAUGHTER]  How do you explain that?  

Who wants it.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE 

You know, that’s an—that’s the scientific equivalent of an urban 

legend and I’m shocked, that not—  

BRIAN LEHRER 

Richard Somerville.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 41. 

 

 

 

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE 

That not—not only, uh, did we hear it from Michael Crichton and 

Philip Stott but we heard it from the fourth member of the pro 

team, Mr. Rosenkranz, at the beginning.  The—there wasn’t a 

scientific consensus in the ‘70s about global cooling.  There was 

hype in the news media.  Quoting Newsweek is not the right way 

to evaluate, uh, scientific thought, you can look it up.  

[APPLAUSE]    

RICHARD S. LINDZEN 

But, can I—can I answer that?   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Wait, Richard Lindzen, go ahead?   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN 

Yeah.  But, you know, the claim of consensus right now is also 

not based on a vote…or anything else, and in fact it was invoked 

by Newsweek in 1988…when they stated all scientists agree.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

But wait, on—do you agree on this 1970s global cooling thing, 

that that was media hype, Richard Lindzen?   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN 

Actually, I do not disagree with Richard on that.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE 

Thank you—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 42. 

 

 

 

RICHARD S. LINDZEN 

I think it is true that the media amplified what was going on 

considerably, and that the field itself was in a much healthier 

state at that time and the open discussions were greater.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Philip Stott, very briefly.   

PHILIP STOTT 

Yeah, what’s very amusing was, one scientist came out in 1970, a 

Swedish scientist, and actually said we should pump out carbon 

dioxide to ensure that we didn’t go into global cooling.  

[LAUGHTER]    

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE 

You know, you—you can always find, uh, people on the fringes—  

BRIAN LEHRER 

Richard Somerville, go ahead—   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE 

You can always find people, uh, on the fringes, consensus doesn’t 

mean unanimity and science isn’t a democracy anyway but it’s 

not good to misrepresent, the situation when an overwhelming 

majority of genuine experts have come to conclusions opposed to 

some of those who’ve heard, uh, from the other side.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

So, so to the yes team…Michael Crichton, you talked about, how 

consensus is sometimes wrong and it takes the individual to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 43. 

 

 

 

burst through the consensus.  [CLEARS THROAT]  Excuse me.  

Um, this debate is set up three on three, as if everything were 

even.   But in the real world out there, we just had the big inter-

governmental panel on climate change report in which 90% of the 

world’s governments and 90% of their atmospheric sciences 

declared with 90% certainty, that global warming is real and 

human beings are causing it.   Why would you three be more 

credible to the non-scientists in our audience, than all of them?   

MICHAEL CRICHTON 

It—it’s…this is always to me a very fascinating point.  If, if we 

were to say, um, does the moon revolve around the earth, uh, we 

would say yes, and no one would ever, would ever preface that by 

saying, well, the consensus of scientists says this.  You know, 

the, the notion of consensus is only a vote for very particular 

kinds of things, and to me it’s a serious warning signal.   For 

example, ordinarily if I were to say the moon is full of green 

cheese, no one would, no one would vilify me or— they would 

take me out and prove to me that that wasn’t the case.  It’s, it’s 

when there isn’t a very good and powerful counter-argument, 

that’s the first answer, the second answer is, is one I really like 

very much and it’s one Einstein made.   He, um…there was a—

the Nazis decided that they would, uh, do something to 

demonstrate that German science was bad and they got 200, uh, 

German scientists to say that Einstein was wrong and then 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 44. 

 

 

 

somebody asked Einstein, how does it feel to have 200 scientists 

against you.  And he said, it takes only one to prove me wrong.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

All right, who on the anti side wants to respond.  Uh, Gavin 

Schmidt.   

GAVIN SCHMIDT 

Okay.  You’ve frequently stated that consensus is not science.  

And you know what, I agree with you.  Consensus is what’s left 

over, after the science has been done.  Consensus is what goes 

into the textbooks.  The science is happening at the frontiers.  It’s 

the filling in of the interesting pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.  It’s the, 

not—it’s not the overall picture, the big picture, is the stuff that 

everybody knows and everybody understands.  Your, your 

assessment of—  You’re—you’re arguing that, because something 

is—people agree on it, you can’t possibly agree with it.  It’s like 

saying, well if you disagree, then I’ll agree.   

MICHAEL CRICHTON 

No, I was—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT 

You’re saying you’ll never agree which means that you’re not 

listening to what the people are saying—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Yeah—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 45. 

 

 

 

MICHAEL CRICHTON 

—what am I saying again—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Michael, go ahead, I’m sorry?   

MICHAEL CRICHTON 

I’m not saying that the consensus is necessarily wrong, I’m only 

saying that consensus is not a—a clear proof that it’s right.    

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

And moreover, Michael—   

PHILIP STOTT  

Of course not, no—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

—has made the point—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Richard Lindzen on the same side, go— continue.    

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

Lamont made the same statement, you don’t use consensus if 

you have a proof.   

PHILIP STOTT  

What’s very important—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Philip Stott, you wanna back that up further—   

PHILIP STOTT  

Yeah, quite, Gavin right, you said, we should always be at the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 46. 

 

 

 

edge, the edge of science on climate change has nothing to do 

with CO2, it’s to do with what we call cosmic rays, the 

relationship to the sun, and water vapor.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Anybody else on the anti side wanna come back on that?  

[LAUGHTER]  They all three got a—got a lick in there.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE 

I—it is—  [LAUGHTER]   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Richard Somerville—   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

It is mind-boggling, to say that [LAUGHS] cosmic rays are the 

cause of, of climate change is to en—endorse one of the least 

proven, most tentative—   

PHILIP STOTT  

I didn’t say that.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

Oh, good, I’m glad—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

But then why—why did you bring it up.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

Why did you bring it up, yeah—   

PHILIP STOTT  

Simply because there are a whole range of scientists who are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 47. 

 

 

 

working on this particular topic and they say it’s one of the big 

unknowns and a great deal of research has just been done on it.  

At the edge—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT 

But we’re—we’re talking about global warming, we’re talking 

about the trend in temperature that—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Gavin Schmidt—    

GAVIN SCHMIDT 

—we’ve seen over the last 30 years.  There has been no trend in 

cosmic rays.  So any change that there might have been because 

of cosmic ray impacts on climate, can’t possibly have an impact 

on what’s been going on—   

PHILIP STOTT  

The most famous—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

—in the last changes.   

PHILIP STOTT  

But the most famous astrophysicist working on it say that it has.   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

Uh, he is wrong.  [LAUGHTER]   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Okay—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 48. 

 

 

 

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

I’m sorry.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

We’re now ready to vote—no, I’m kidding.  Um, for—   

PHILIP STOTT  

That’s a serious accusation against some very serious sci—some 

are infinitely better than any of us on this platform today.   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

I’d like to meet the person—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

Explain that—   

PHILIP STOTT  

There are some very eminent scientists, Professor Jan Veizer for 

example, uh, uh, Nir Sh—Professor Nir Shaviv who won the 

Young Scientist of the Year in Israel two years ago, who are in 

fact arguing that 70% of, of climate change is primarily driven by 

cosmic rays working through water vapor and clouds.   I’m not 

saying they’re right or wrong, they’re pointing however at the 

edge, to new research.  You cannot dismiss that, because it’s a 

consensus for CO2.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Gavin Schmidt, one more time?   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

Okay, this is exactly what I was talking about.  You see?  Now, it 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 49. 

 

 

 

looks like we’re having a scientific argument, but, this is 

completely bogus.  You don’t know that it’s bogus, but I know 

that it’s bogus, he knows that it’s bogus.  [LAUGHTER]  You’re 

being led astray.  [LAUGHTER]    

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

You’ll forgive me, Gavin…  [APPLAUSE]  If—if you seriously wish 

to maintain that, then you’d better explain why—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Richard Lindzen—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

—between you and Richard, you’ve made statements that are 

overtly untrue.  And I’ll give you some.  You say, the earth has 

been warmer—is warmer now than it has been for 1300 years.  

The national academy evaluating this said, the methodology was 

no use beyond 400 years.   Why do you make this statement.  

You keep on quoting these groups, and when they disagree with 

them, you make up the quote.   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

I—I’ve gotta say that one, one thing at a time—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Gavin Schmidt—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

—let’s deal with that.  The National Academy of Science report 

said that we have good evidence that we’re warmer from 400 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 50. 

 

 

 

years ago, we have credible evidence that we’re warmer from 

900—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

No, they did not—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

Yes they did, Richard, please—  [LAUGHTER]   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

No, the—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

Read the reports before—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

—front end—the front end said—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

Read the—read more than the front page, Richard—    

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

No, I’m saying the text, said it was not credible beyond 400 

years—  

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

That’s not what it—that’s not what it said—   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE 

Moreover, moreover—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Right, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 51. 

 

 

 

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

I can tell you why it’s not—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

We’re into “he said”-“he said.”  But—  [LAUGHTER]  But Gavin 

Schmidt, you seem to suggest that the other side does not have a 

real scientific argument, but a culturally or politically 

constructed one.  You don’t think they’re sincere?   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

That’s a very difficult question.  I think—I— no, I, I do think that 

they’re sincere—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

You as much as said it.   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

I don’t think that they are completely…doing this on a level 

playing field that the people here will understand.  And, there 

are…   

AUDIENCE MEMBERS 

[MOANS, VOICES, ETC.]   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Well…  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]  explain yourself, because—wait 

a minute—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

No, let me—let me explain, explain that—    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 52. 

 

 

 

BRIAN LEHRER  

Because they have larger cultural or political agendas?   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

No, um, I have no idea what their political or cultural agendas 

are, and to be frank I’m not very interested.   

PHILIP STOTT  

I’m left-wing and have no money whatsoever from any oil 

company—

Okay, and—

That’s fine.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  That’s fine.  But I’m, I’m—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

All right—    

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

—I’m not interested in your motivations—

BRIAN LEHRER  

Let’s go to the audience, and, when you ask your questions, uh, 

members of the press, please identify yourselves as such.  

Members of the audience who are not with the press, you have 

the option to identify yourself, or not.  Okay.  Right down here.    

LINDA CARO 

Hi, my name is Linda Caro, um, it kind of surprises me that , uh, 

the emphasis is on CO2 which is about one-third of 1% of the 

total atmosphere, whereas global—uh, water vapor is the vast 

bulk of it all.  Uh, is it possible that we are, um…are not 

accounting properly for, uh, the giving off of heat such as nuclear 

power plants which are several thousand degrees Centi—uh, 

Fahrenheit, that we’re cooling with water and air, every day, every 

week, every month, every year, that can’t—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Is there anyone you would particularly like to answer that 

question?  

LINDA CARO 

Whoever feels most qualified.  [LAUGHTER]   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Richard Somerville is raising his hand.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

The, the direct heating from sources like power plants is 

negligible, uh, compared to these, these other factors, solar 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 54. 

 

 

 

radiation, greenhouse effect.  And the greenhouse effect is due to 

water vapor, primarily carbon dioxide and other gas is secondary, 

we can’t control water vapors.   It’s controlled by the atmosphere 

itself, largely by temperature, so when you add CO2, you 

humidify the atmosphere and the water adds to the warming.  

That’s one reason why Richard Lindzen’s talking about CO2 only 

giving you a degree or so is disingenuous because that feedback 

is expected theoretically and has been observed.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

I think Richard Stott is, uh—Philip Stott is bursting out of his 

chair to agree with you.  [LAUGHTER]   

PHILIP STOTT  

I could not agree more.  Yes, it’s governed by the atmosphere.  

Absolutely, and is not under our control.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

But it’s—   

PHILIP STOTT  

It is therefore one of the big factors, that we have no control over.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

It’s—   

PHILIP STOTT  

In a non-linear couple system.    

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

I’m, I’m, I’m stunned by, by your amazement that non-linear 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 55. 

 

 

 

coupled chaotic systems are things that we can’t understand 

even in part, that—    

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

He didn’t say that—   

PHILIP STOTT  

I said—I said control.   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

Very—very good.  You can control how much CO2 you put in the 

atmosphere and that will have a big effect on how much water 

vapor is in the atmosphere, that’s not controversial.   

PHILIP STOTT  

Well you can’t predict—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

That is controversial—   

PHILIP STOTT  

Yeah.   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

—and it’s controversial because it is not a homogeneous 

distribution of water vapor.   

PHILIP STOTT  

Yeah, exactly.   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

And, you know, to pretend this is settled, is bizarre.  Moreover 

with clouds, which are comparably important, you know full well, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 56. 

 

 

 

that that is not settled.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Let us—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

By a long shot.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

—go to another questioner from the audience—   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

[INAUDIBLE]   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Down on this side in the front.   

ANDREW REVKIN 

Uh, Andy Revkin from the New York Times, this is, this is kind of 

neat to, to listen to.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Did I hear a hiss?  [LAUGHTER]    

ANDREW REVKIN 

Ssss.  Back atcha.  [LAUGHTER]  Um, I’ve been writing about this 

for a long time.  Uh, most every aspect of it.  So my question is, 

uh, one about the hedging, managing risk came up before, which 

is not what you think of when you think of crisis and 

catastrophe.   My—my sense is that there’s one thing that 

everyone has agreed on, at least—except maybe Philip, which is 

that, more greenhouse gases will make the world warmer.  Is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 57. 

 

 

 

there anyone other than Philip who disagrees with that—    

PHILIP STOTT  

I don’t disagree with it.   

ANDREW REVKIN 

Okay, you did it—yeah, so, we all—I love to find the things we 

agree on.  Um, so everyone agrees, more greenhouse gases will 

make the world warmer.  Uh, the doubling is, is a step on the 

staircase we’re—we’re heading on toward tripling or quadrupling, 

I think everyone would mostly agree that if we go to nine billion 

people, all of whom would love to have our level of affluence, 

we’re going in that direction.   And so, as a hedging exercise, if it 

weren’t costly to slow the pace, beyond the Jesse Ausubel very 

slow [LAUGHS] decarbonization, if we could find a new way that 

didn’t cost a lot, that actually could give energy for those 

developing countries that crave it, and limit emissions at the 

same time, would anyone on the pro side think that it’s a bad 

idea to stop emitting greenhouse gases, if there were a solution.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Michael Crichton, you’re shaking your head no?   

MICHAEL CRICHTON  

No—   

ANDREW REVKIN 

As a hedge—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 58. 

 

 

 

MICHAEL CRICHTON  

—no, I don’t think anybody objects, uh, the, the, the question is 

whether or not you’re gonna spend what Bjorn Lomberg thinks 

which is $558 trillion and I think, if in fact it’s going to prove to 

be that kind of enormous construction project, then that should 

not be the first priority right this minute.  But no, I don’t—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

So let me pursue Andy Revkin’s stab at striking a consensus on 

what to do.  For the anti side…if this is a crisis, what kind of 

lifestyle change, what kind of economic pain, and how quickly are 

you proposing…to hedge our bets?   

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

ASAP—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Brenda Ekwurzel.   

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

[LAUGHS]  As soon as possible because—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

But what?   

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

Everything, everything that we can throw at solving this climate 

crisis—well, this climate problem, is important because, every 

day that we emit carbon dioxide means that it will last for many, 

many centuries, and so we have to start weaning ourselves off of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 59. 

 

 

 

ways of emitting more methane, more nitrous oxide, all the heat-

trapping gases, not just carbon dioxide, it’s the ones that have 

long life, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, that are very, very 

important, in the short term methane is very important ‘cause it 

has such heat-trapping potential.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

But forgive me—   

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

And so, landfills—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

—but the question from—   

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

—everything, uh—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

The—the question from the audience was, things that we could 

do, correct me if I’m wrong, Andrew, things that we could do 

without much pain that would stave this off—   

PHILIP STOTT  

Well—    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Either you’re talking about—   

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

Well, what—

—revolution, anything necessary.   

PHILIP STOTT  

The real problem is—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Philip Stott—   

PHILIP STOTT  

—there’s no social discounting in this, let’s get a bit of economics 

in.  So in fact, if you—if you have an increase now, and you take 

inflation into account, what you’re doing is an average world, um, 

income at the moment of $7,500.   Predicted by a—a distance 

ahead, that will rise to about $88,000, you knock off what in fact 

the Stern Report in Britain estimated, as in fact the cost of global 

warming, 13.27 or so percent, it comes down to something like, 

uh, 70-something thousand dollars but even taking inflation 

account [sic],  that is still a massive increase in wealth so what 

you’re actually asking in economic terms, is what is strange but a 

poorer generation to sacrifice a great deal for what will in any 

case, even with global warming cares, be a wealthier generation.   

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

The thing is that companies right now when they reduce heat-

trapping emissions they find profits that keep giving back to them 

because, right now we’re so wealthy in many nations of the world 

that we are wasting energy because we can afford to.   And the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 61. 

 

 

 

reality is many companies are saving lots of money when they 

make small investments to reduce their emissions, DuPont did 

50 million to invest, they’re getting 2 billion on return on that 

investment, and it keeps on giving, so, it’s not an 

economic…argument.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Anything else from the anti side that you think might be…   

MAN  

The, the—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

—consensus, uh, good for us anyway kind of measures that they 

might agree to?   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

Right.  Energy conservation—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Gavin Schmidt.   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

Everybody is gonna agree that energy conservation is a good 

thing and it should be encouraged.  Um, right.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

That’s three heads nodding on this side?   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

Yeah.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 62. 

 

 

 

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

You’re gonna argue with energy conservation—  [LAUGHTER]    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Two—all right, two, two and a half.  Two and a half heads, that’s 

good enough.  Go—go on, Richard Somerville.    

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

You know, a lot of things could be done, once you free up the 

creativity of, uh, of technical people, of business people by 

making this a priority nationally and internationally, the problem 

isn’t that there’s nothing that can be done, the problem is that, 

the people who are asking for your vote haven’t heard loudly 

enough that this is an important issue to the electorate,  so it’s 

way down on people’s priorities, that’s the reason for the lip 

service that Michael Crichton talked about, people are a lot like, 

like Mark Twain, they’re all for progress but are opposed to 

change.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Let’s go—  [LAUGHTER]  Let’s go back to the audience, someone 

on this side, do we have someone lined up on that side?  Okay.    

HEATHER HIGGINS 

Thank you, my name is Heather Higgins, I’m not a scientist, so, 

pardon my ignorance when I hear the scientistic—scientific 

establishment believes in something I immediately think of flat-

earth consensus, and the fact that there’s no geography that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 63. 

 

 

 

should be admitted as science and that women are all hysterics 

and ought to be bled.  Uh, so, uh, that, um, assurance that the 

scientific community believes something does not take me very 

far.   My question is address particularly to Brenda, as well as to 

anyone else.  Um, I was fascinated by your statement that the 

earth is more fragile than human beings are.   Uh, I am not a 

scientist so maybe you can explain to me how we managed to get 

through the Ice Age and the Middle Ages when Greenland was 

actually green and people were a foot taller and there was 

farming there, uh, and nobody was digging up coal to warm the 

earth.   Um, and, I’m curious as to why you think that this is an 

optimal period of climate, uh, certainly for far less money we 

could move everybody out of Battery Park City.  And I am 

curious, if you believe that CO2 is actually the, the—the 

particular problem is actually the issue, the degree to which you 

are willing to, to become like France, where instead of having 

20% of their power from nuclear, they have 86%.   

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

When there was a natural ice age before and when we were 

coming out of that ice age there weren’t millions of people, 80% of 

our population living on the coasts with their high-dollar homes 

or, maybe fragile homes, not such high-dollar homes.   There are 

many people living in Bangladesh that are squeezed between sea-

level rise and the melting of the, the Himalayas and flooding from 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 64. 

 

 

 

the land side.  And so, we are talking about the fragility of 

humans adapting to this rapid change, as well as, when—  In the 

past, sea-level rise, you could have, for example, wetlands 

marching up onto land, and moving inland and adapting and 

dunes moving inland, right now we have all our infrastructure in 

its place, and you can see, Miami is stranded out there, Atlantic 

City is stranded out there,  we spend many of— millions of 

dollars dredging, and, and keeping these unsustainable systems 

that are not able to adapt naturally anymore because we’re in the 

way.  And we also are gonna suffer, if we don’t, uh, make action.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Philip Stott, you get 20 seconds to respond—   

PHILIP STOTT  

Yeah, it was a, I think a brilliant question that, because the earth 

is as tough as an old boot.  If there is any fragility it’s in us and 

that’s what we’re concerned about, the earth will survive whether 

we’re here or not or whether there’s global warming or not—   

BRIAN LEHRER  

Question on this side?    

VAN GREENFIELD 

Hi, Van Greenfield, just following up a little bit on the, 

uh…question two minutes ago on what we could do, um…  

Philip, you had said in another article, “My own instinct is that 

our ability to change reflectivity on the earth’s surface will in the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 65. 

 

 

 

end prove to have been far more important.”  In terms of the 

concept of reflectivity could you expand on that and its 

possible…less expensive method for dealing with this?  

BRIAN LEHRER 

Very briefly, please.   

PHILIP STOTT  

Very briefly, but it’s a very important point, the point is very 

simple, that humans are not just doing CO2, we do many factors, 

and the way we have altered the albedo as we call it, the surface 

reflectivity of the earth, uh, particularly I may add since the 

Neolithic revolution in agriculture has had probably quite a 

significant effect.   However, we can’t model it very well.  And the 

problem is it’s one of those big gaps like many others things in 

the models that we’re talking—and that is a human factor.  So in 

other words I agree with that, exactly how we cope with it though 

is another issue, because we know so little about it.   And can I 

remind everybody that IPCC that we keep talking about, very 

honestly admits that we know very little about 80% of the factors 

behind climate change.   

BRIAN LEHRER  

One more thing for the anti side…bef—oh, you wanna—okay, go 

ahead and give a quick response to that, 20-second response?  

Go—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 66. 

 

 

 

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

Uh, what is 80%—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Gavin, Gavin Schmidt—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

—of the counter-factors even mean.  If you look at, if you look at 

the radiative forcing from carbon dioxide, from methane, from 

nitrous oxide, from CFC’s, from tropospheric ozone, from 

stratospheric ozone, from land-use change, from aerosols, from 

black soo—from black soot’s pa—um, impacts on, um, snow 

albedo, you know…all of those, all of those things, we know some 

of them very well, we know some of them less well.  But to, to, to 

claim that we don’t know anything about 80% of them, is, it’s, it’s 

a meaningless statistic—   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

Yeah, I’d like to—could I chime in there just for a moment, 

Brian—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Richard Somerville, also 20 seconds—   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

Listen, it’s, it’s fun to hear other people practicing meteorology 

without a license, so, and you know—  [LAUGHTER]  This, this 

field is like all fields of science, you know, medical science is 

incomplete and has uncertainties too.  But it’s good enough to be 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 67. 

 

 

 

useful.   You don’t dismiss your doctor’s advice, because she 

hasn’t solved all the diseases.  And I think the same is true of 

climate science today.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Philip Stott—   

PHILIP STOTT  

Don’t dismiss it—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

—one—one retort.    

PHILIP STOTT  

Well let’s use an engineer, I don’t think I’d want to cross Brooklyn 

Bridge if it were built by an engineer who only understood 80% of 

the forces on that bridge.  [LAUGHTER]    

BRIAN LEHRER  

There’s one thing…    

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

I—I actually—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

That—   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

—I, we, we…I think we might have a solution to the energy crisis, 

we just need to tap Philip Stott.  [LAUGHTER]    

BRIAN LEHRER  

There is one thing that I think we need to get to before we wrap 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 68. 

 

 

 

up.  For the anti side…they say…the real crises today include 

poverty, dirty water, and a lack of modern energy supply to 4 

billion poor people on earth.  So if this is a crisis, how do you 

prioritize it, compared to those other things, and assuming that it 

takes tremendous amounts of resources to solve any of them.    

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

You know, I—I cannot imagine why Philip Stott and Michael 

Crichton seem to think that doing something about these terrible 

crises is impossible if you do something about climate change, or 

even made more difficult, climate change need not be in 

competition with or be an alternative to doing something about 

the terrible toll that poverty and preventable disease take.   We 

can do both of those and many other worthy things as well, in 

fact, it’s exactly the poorest and most vulnerable people on the 

planet who will suffer the most from the consequences of, of 

global warming which goes on unabated.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Michael Crichton?   

MICHAEL CRICHTON  

You know, uh, I’m really fascinated at the number of newspaper 

headlines and articles that I see about global poverty and the, 

and the difficulties of people in Africa as compared to the 

headlines about, about global warming, and, um, uh, of course 

Richard it’s very true that we can do two things at the same time, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 69. 

 

 

 

it—the, the reality is that we don’t.  And the reality is, that, we 

are failing and have continuously failed to address the issues of 

the third world even though, everyone knows that if you were to, 

to look at it for bangs for the buck, if you were to look at it from a 

humanitarian standpoint, if you were to look at it from the 

easiest way to do the most for environmental degradation as it’s 

created around the world, you would address global poverty.  But 

we’re not.   We’re talking as we’re talking tonight, we’re all getting 

very heated about something that may or may not happen 100 

years from now.  And while we’re doing, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000 

people are dead.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

That concludes…  [LAUGHTER]  the discussion portion of our 

program.  [APPLAUSE]  And it is now time to vote.  If you wanna 

vote for the motion, tear off “For” from the top…of the motion, uh, 

ballot, and slip into the ballot boxes…  This is a ballot box, that 

will be passed among you.  If you are against the motion, tear off 

and deposit “Against” into the ballot box, and if you still don’t 

know where you stand…put your entire ticket into the box.   The 

ballot boxes will be given to the person at one end of a row, 

please pass the ballot box to your neighbor until it reaches the 

end of the row, pass it down just like in third grade.  One of the 

ushers will then take the box to the next row, everyone will get a 

chance to vote so please don’t reach over your neighbor, wait for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 70. 

 

 

 

a ballot box to be passed to you.   If you need a voting ticket, the 

ushers will give you one, just ask.  No voter fraud, please.  Okay.  

Now, here’s the deal.  While you’re voting, we will have the closing 

remarks, two minutes, from each presenter, so we ask for your 

silence while they finish up, and then of course we will read the 

results of your voting.   So now the final remarks from the 

panelists, beginning with the side opposing the motion, panelists, 

please stay in your seats this time around, we begin with Richard 

Somerville.    

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

You know, the, the fossil fuel age will surely end, sooner rather 

than later I hope if we’re wise.  Sheikh Yamani, the Saudi oil 

minister was fond of saying “The Stone Age did not end because 

we ran out of stones.”  And continuing to generate 80% of the 

world’s energy from fossil fuel and using the atmosphere as a free 

dump for waste products, will ultimately produce a damaged 

planet.   We’ve heard a lot of chatter about decarbonization this 

evening, the fact is that carbon dioxide emissions in the US and 

globally are going up, not down.  Sherwood Rowland, later a 

Nobel laureate, was a frustrated person in 1984, because 

humanity was so slow in dealing with the issue of ozone 

depletion.   He said, quote, “After all, what’s the use of having 

developed a science well enough to make predictions, if in the 

end, all we’re willing to do is stand around and wait for them to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 71. 

 

 

 

come true.”  Roland’s remark is apt for our topic tonight.  As in 

the case of ozone loss, so with global warming, once again, 

powerful technology, in this case abundant cheap fossil—  

BRIAN LEHRER 

One—   

RICHARD C.J. SOMERVILLE  

—fuel energy, with unanticipated side effects, has brought us a 

Faustian bargain.  Once again, the world finds itself at a point 

where difficult decisions must be made.  That’s the definition of a 

crisis.  Nothing to do with alarmism or catastrophe.   Once again 

doing nothing or too little will lead to dire consequences.  

Belittling the science, attacking the scientists, impugning their 

integrity and, and competence and motivations, refusing to 

recognize what we have learned about climate change in the vain 

and naïve hope that the problem will somehow solve itself is 

irresponsible.   Action is needed, meaningful action, soon.  Global 

warming is a crisis.  Thank you.  I hope you voted against.  

[APPLAUSE]   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Philip Stott, your closing statement.   

PHILIP STOTT  

May I say that the last thing I want to do is to demean any 

scientist.  The whole point about science is that it is a constant 

debate.  And actually, what has worried me deeply about this is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 72. 

 

 

 

not the demeaning of scientists but the attempt to close down the 

debate, and actually take it away from science.  [APPLAUSE]   If I 

may use a musical analogy, my other great interest, trying to 

reconstruct the climates of the moment as we’re talking about is 

a bit like trying to play Mozart’s wonderful Symphonia 

Concertante 364, when you’ve no viola part and only a quarter of 

the violin part.   In other words we know remarkably little about 

so much of the climate that, that we are facing.  And, what I 

would like to stress is, it—it’s a debate on the crisis.  We’ve 

mentioned the crisis of poverty, and I think the crisis of 

hypocrisy.  Actually where I think we probably agree entirely as a 

panel, what there really is in the world, there’s not a crisis of 

climate, a crisis of energy.   That is certainly true in my country.  

And I’ll tell you what worries me particularly about attaching it to 

climate.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

One.    

PHILIP STOTT  

In the world, there are groups, including some very reputable 

groups in Denmark and in Russia and in other countries, which 

are predicting actually that we will enter a global cooling phase 

between 2012 and 2015.  Now, I no more necessarily believe that 

than I do about the global warming.   But just supposing that 

happens, and just supposing what the public reaction is to the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 73. 

 

 

 

hype that there has been about global warming, I actually think 

that we have to face up to a genuine energy issue in the world, 

and that most of our politicians are not doing that, in fact they’re 

dressing it up in this idea of global warming and saving the 

world, and what we desperately need are very practical decisions 

about energy, on the ground.   And I think the idea of using the 

climate to do this is potentially a very dangerous one.  So, what I 

am worried about is that everybody is now using the global con—

global warming construction for their own agendas.  From 

capitalist carbon trading, right the way to making you wear hemp 

underpants.  [LAUGHTER]  I distrust that because in the end—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Philip Stott—   

PHILIP STOTT  

—it’s an ism—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

—thank you very much—   

PHILIP STOTT  

—and I distrust isms.  [APPLAUSE]    

BRIAN LEHRER  

Gavin Schmidt, your closing statement.   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

Hemp underpants, ugh.  [LAUGHTER]  Climate change is not a 

new issue.  Even human-cause climate change is not new.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 74. 

 

 

 

Richard Lindzen was arguing these same points 15 years ago, 

Michael Crichton is recycling talking points that are decades old.     

Philip Stott is grasping at extremely flimsy straws.  Serious 

scientists in the 1960s made predictions for what would be found 

if human emissions of greenhouse gases were to continue.   They 

said the planet would warm.  It has.  They said the water vapor 

measurements would show rises.  They do.  They said that hos—

ocean heat content would rise.  It has.  They said the 

stratosphere would cool.  It did.  If I had time I could go on listing 

the number of challenges this basic idea has faced and come 

through.   But you only need to know that it is still standing, and 

that there are no coherent theories that fit the observations 

better.  Given that understanding, and the ever-increasing 

emissions that we are putting into the air, to deny this is a crisis 

on a planetary scale is truly to fiddle while home burns.    

BRIAN LEHRER  

One.   

GAVIN SCHMIDT  

I’m done.   

BRIAN LEHRER 

That’s it?  [APPLAUSE]  Richard Lindzen, your closing statement.   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN  

Yes.  I think it’s a little bit difficult to know how to respond, to be 

told that, uh, one shouldn’t attack scientists while you’re 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 75. 

 

 

 

attacking scientists, to go and say you have to control methane 

without explaining that methane has stopped growing.   You 

don’t explain why there’s global warming on Mars, Jupiter, Triton 

and Pluto.  You don’t look at the ocean data and see, that 

whereas your boss Jim Hansen was saying that the heating of the 

ocean proved the flux that he needed for high sensitivity, that in 

the last year there’ve been two papers in the same journal, that 

point out that the original Levitus data’s wrong, that the ocean is 

cool, and that the new numbers would call for one-tenth the 

sensitivity that Hansen mentioned.   If all this is so certain,  why 

is the data changing, or is it a case when the data changes you 

ignore it, and—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

One—   

RICHARD S. LINDZEN 

—stick to the point.  [APPLAUSE]    

BRIAN LEHRER  

You have a minute, do you want the other minute?  You have a 

minute—no?  Uh, okay.  Brenda Ekwurzel, your closing 

statement.    

BRENDA EKWURZEL  

Global warming is here today and is accelerating.  Many business 

leaders are already realizing that it makes economic sense to 

start fighting global warming.  Wal-Mart, DuPont, BP, General 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 76. 

 

 

 

Electric, they all are asking for action.  And, businesses need a 

clear signal from the national level.   Because they want to have a 

level playing field, and, they want to plan for the future.  And 

that’s what makes good business sense.  We need a national 

policy because people, cities and states cannot reduce global 

warming enough to make a significant dent in this issue.   

Ultimately the atmosphere is gonna register all of our choices 

from today onward.  We must act now because if we leave it to 

our children, the risk will be too great and it will be too late.   

Fortunately there already exist solutions, all we—we need now is 

the will to implement them rapidly.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]   

BRIAN LEHRER 

Michael Crichton, your closing statement.    

MICHAEL CRICHTON  

There was a time when I worked in a clinic and, uh, one day a 

young woman came in, she was in her early twenties for a routine 

checkup and, I said what’s going on with you and she said I’ve 

just become blind.  And, I said, oh my gosh, really, when did it 

happen, she said, well just, uh, coming into the clinic, walking up 

the steps of the clinic I became blind.  And I said, oh, and I’m—by 

now I’m looking through the chart and I said, well, has this 

happened before, she said yes, it’s happened before.   I’ve become 

blind in the past, and, what she had of course was hysterical 

blindness.  And the characteristic of that, is that, the severity of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 77. 

 

 

 

the symptom is not matched by the emotional response that’s, 

that’s being presented.   Most people would be screaming about 

that but she was very calm, oh yes, I’m blind again.  And I’m 

reminded of that whenever I hear, that we’re facing, whether we 

wanna call it a crisis or not, a significant global event, of, of, of 

importance where we’re gonna have species lost and so on and so 

forth—   

BRIAN LEHRER 

One—   

MICHAEL CRICHTON  

—that we can really address this by changing our light bulbs.  Or 

that we can really make an impact by unplugging our appliances 

when we’re not using them.  It’s very much out of whack.  And so 

if…if it were only gonna do symbolic actions, I would like to 

suggest a few symbolic actions that right—might really mean 

something.   One of them, which is very simple, 99% of the 

American population doesn’t care, is ban private jets.  Nobody 

needs to fly in them, ban them now.   And, and in addition, 

[APPLAUSE]  let’s have the NRDC, the, the Sierra Club and 

Greenpeace make it a rule that all of their, all of their members, 

cannot fly on private jets, they must get their houses off the grid, 

they must live in the way that they’re telling everyone else to live.   

And if they won’t do that, why should we.  And why should we 

take them seriously.  [APPLAUSE]

BRIAN LEHRER  

I wanna thank the debaters…  and the audience for all your good 

work.  Before I announce the results of the audience vote I wanna 

take care of a few little things.  First, the next Intelligence 

Squared US debate will take place on Wednesday, April 18th, here 

at the Asia Society and Museum.  The motion to be debated is, 

“Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11.”   The 

remaining two debates in this spring series including that one are 

all sold out.  The good news is that packages are available on-line 

and by phone for the Fall 2007-Spring 2008 series.  Priority will 

be given to full-season subscribers, so avoid disappointment and 

buy those series packages now.  [LAUGHTER]   Tonight’s debate 

can be heard locally on WNYC AM 820, on Friday, March 23rd at 

2 p.m.  You can also purchase DVD’s from previous debates 

upstairs in the lobby or on the Intelligence Squared US website.  

Finally, please be sure to pick up a copy of the Times Literary 

Supplement—are those actually available, there was some 

question about that.  Is that a—yes, yes, they are available, uh, 

as you leave the auditorium, and in a minute you can all go home 

and watch the “American Idol” results show.  [LAUGHTER]  And 

now the results of our debate.  After our debaters did their best 

to sway you…you went from, 30% for the motion that global 

warming is not a crisis, from 30% to 46%.  [APPLAUSE]   Against 

the motion, went from 57% to 42%…  [SCATTERED APPLAUSE,  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz-Intelligence Squared US-“Global warming is not a crisis” Page 79.
