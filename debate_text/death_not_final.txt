John Donvan: 
I’m interested to hear what he has to say about this one, so let's please welcome to the 
stage Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Hi, Bob.  How are you? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Good. 
 
John Donvan: 
So I was just saying, you know, normally we're doing foreign policy and defense 
spending debates.  And tonight we're going a little bit in a different direction with this 
discussion of the afterlife.  So what's the thought behind putting this on the stage now? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, one of the things that kind of got me to think that this would be a very interesting 
debate is a sermon I heard in a Catholic church many, many years ago, in which the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 2 -

priest was challenging people to believe in an afterlife.  And the argument he made was 
quasi scientific.  He said, imagine a fetus in his mother's womb that's almost ready to be 
born, nine-month, full-term baby.  
 
18:49:18 
And you're trying to convey to this baby what's about to happen, that it's going to have 
an incredibly painful experience going through the birth canal, that its ties to its mother 
through which it's getting all kinds of nutrients and all the oxygen is going to be severed.  
But not to worry, there's going to be a great life afterwards.  There's going to be all kinds 
of experiences and sensory things and development and emotional growth and just an 
incredible world that you cannot imagine.  And when you think about that, of course, 
you say, of course you could -- there's no way you could communicate that.  And there's 
no way that the baby could understand it.  And yet we all know it's true.  So it kind of 
invites you to think, is it possible that there's something that we can't -- we can not 
imagine, that we don't understand, but nonetheless is true about life after death? 
 
18:50:20  
 
John Donvan: 
I mean, I want to ask you one point about the approach we're taking to this.  But before 
we get to that, do you have a lot of these epiphanies in churches? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I'm Jewish, actually.  But -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
You know, the Jews do have the highest resurrection rate in the world. 
[laughter and applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
My question is, we're not looking at this is a religious debate, speaking of which, we're 
really taking a different cut at it. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
No, of course.  And that's what I think sort of makes it much more of a factually 
grounded and intellectually grounded argument, and it's the reason we're doing this, is 
to take it away from the questions purely of faith and try to do as scientific an approach 
as we can to this topic which obviously interests a lot of people.

Well, the great thing is we have four scientists debating tonight, so let's welcome them 
to the stage, and thank you to Bob Rosenkranz. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Thank you, John. 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Now I can see.  And I just want to actually invite one more round of applause to 
Bob Rosenkranz for making this all possible. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
So the difference between going to heaven some day and getting hit in the head with a 
hammer right now is that going to heaven some day sounds so much better than getting 
hit in the head with a hammer right now.  
 
18:52:18  
But at least with the hammer, you know that the hammer is real.  Science can see the 
hammer.  Science can weigh it and take its measurements and even cut it up into little 
pieces and put it into test tubes.  But heaven, the afterlife, science cannot see that, not 
with a telescope, not with a microscope.  So does that mean that heaven is not as real as 
the hammer?  Or does it just mean that science and scientists don't know yet how to 
find heaven, how to look for it?  Well, that sounds like the makings of a debate.  So let's 
have it.  Yes or no to this statement:  Death is not final, a debate from Intelligence 
Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four superbly qualified debaters, scientists all, 
but they divide on this issue:  Death is not final.  They will argue two against two for and 
against.  We are at the Kaufman Music Center in New York City.  
 
18:53:16   
 
As always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then the live audience votes to 
choose the winner, and only one side wins.  Let's meet our debaters and the team 
arguing for the motion, death is not final, please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome Eben 
Alexander. 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And Eben, in a way, you are our founding story in this debate tonight.  You are an 
academic neurosurgeon, 15 years on the faculty of Harvard Medical School.  But in 
2008, you got very, very sick.  You went in a coma for seven days.  Your brain effectively 
stopped showing signs of life in the higher functions.  And you came back, and you said,

  Arlington, VA 22203 

"I was there.  I saw it.  I've seen the afterlife."  In one word, what did you see?  What 
was it?  
 
18:54:17 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Astonishing. 
 
John Donvan: 
Astonishing.  And if you had heard somebody, back before you had this experience, 
make that same sort of claim, what would you have said? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
"no way," at least not until I knew all the facts. 
 
John Donvan: 
We'll hear more of the facts from you tonight.  Ladies and gentlemen, Eben Alexander. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And Eben, your partner is? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
My very good friend, Dr. Raymond Moody. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Raymond Moody. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And Raymond, you are also arguing for this motion that death is not final.  You're a 
psychiatrist, and you have a medical degree, a doctorate in philosophy.  You are 
described as "the founder of the near death experience."  You coined that phrase in 
your book in 1975, "Life After Life," in which you looked at more than a hundred cases 
of people who had experienced clinical death and come back.  You've been looking at 
this now for decades.  But it's interesting to us to note that your curiosity in this whole 
thing was piqued not by religious conviction.  What was it? 
 
18:55:22  
 
Raymond Moody: 
No, I'm -- I was not --

John Donvan: 
Can you just move a little closer to your mic. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
Yes.  I was not religious.  I got interested in the afterlife question at age 18 when Plato 
convinced me, through his argument, that the afterlife question is the most important 
question of existence. 
 
John Donvan: 
We're going to be hearing about Plato tonight? 
 
Raymond Moody: 
Yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
We're looking forward to it.  Ladies and gentlemen, Raymond Moody.  And that's the 
team arguing for the motion.  And now the team to argue against this motion, "Death is 
not final," please, ladies and gentlemen, welcome Sean Carroll. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Sean, you are a physicist at the California Institute of Technology.  Your research focuses 
on fundamental physics and cosmology, the study –of the origin and the evolution of 
the universe.  You've written a lot of books, including "The Particle at the End of the 
Universe," which is about the quest to discover the Higgs Boson, which is a celebrity 
among particles.  And you have described yourself as a naturalist.  
 
18:56:24  
 
So for the purposes of understanding where you're coming from, what does that term 
briefly mean? 
 
Sean Carroll: 
A naturalist is one who believes there is one world, the natural world.  And it is our job 
to deal with it. 
 
John Donvan: 
And are you dealing? 
 
Sean Carroll: 
Okay.  So far so good.

John Donvan: 
Steven, you are also arguing against the motion that death is not final.  You are a 
neurologist at Yale School of Medicine.  You're the founder of the website, "Science-
Based Medicine," cofounder of the New England Skeptical Society.  We sense, you 
know, there's a theme running through this.  
 
18:57:21  
You know, you -- The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe is your podcast.  So you're doing all 
of this neurology.  Why did you decide to put yourself out there as a skeptic? 
 
Steve Novella : 
Well, I had briefly considered a career in interpretive dance. 
 
[laughter] 
 
but sadly, I had to conclude that my talents lay elsewhere.  So I thought science 
skepticism was a good match. 
 
John Donvan: 
The dance of skepticism. 
 
Steve Novella : 
The dance of skepticism.  I'll work on that. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our debaters tonight.

John Donvan: 
And this is a debate.  Our motion is "death is not final."  And in this debate, we go in 
three rounds, and only one side will win.  And that side will be chosen by you, our live 
audience.  By the time this debate has ended, we will have asked you to vote twice; 
once before the debate and once again afterwards to tell us where you stand on this 
motion.  And the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point 
terms will be declared our winner.  So let's go to the first vote.  If you go to these key 
pads at your seat, look again at the motion on the screens:  Death is not final.  If you are 
for this motion, push number one. 
 
18:58:14 
 
If you are against it, push number two.  And if you're undecided, push number three, 
which is, by the way, a perfectly honorable position with which to start this debate.  You 
can ignore the other keys.  And if you push the wrong one, just correct yourself, and the 
system will lock in your last vote, and we're going to wrap this up in about 12 seconds.  
Okay, looks like everybody's done.  So let's move on.  Let's start this debate.  Let's get on 
to round one.  Round one, our motion is, "Death is not final."  In round one, we have 
opening statements from each debater in turn.  They will be seven minutes each.  And 
here to speak first for the motion, Eben Alexander.  He is an academic neurosurgeon 
who taught at Harvard Medical School.  He is author also of the bestselling book, "Proof 
of Heaven."  Ladies and gentlemen, Eben Alexander. 
[cheering and applause] 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Thank you very much, John.  
 
18:59:14  
 
I've been an academic neurosurgeon for over 20 years, and I fully believed in reductive 
materialism, our modern conventional science.  In fact, six years ago I would've been 
sitting over on that side of the stage with Steven and Sean.  Now, at that time I believed 
that the brain creates mind and consciousness, that we have no free will, that it's birth 
to death and nothing more.  Then something happened.  I now know that those ideas 
are false.  In November 2008 I was driven rapidly into coma due to a severe bacterial 
meningoencephalitis which I much later came to realize is the perfect model for human 
death, destruction of the neocortex, the outer surface, the human part of the brain.  
Sadly almost no one returns, much less recovers, from a case of meningitis as severe as 
mine.  The last evidence of any activity in my neocortex was in the first hour, so in the 
emergency room and afterwards I demonstrated only very pathological reflexes 
including severe brainstem damage.  



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
19:00:16 
 
Given my gram negative bacterial meningoencephalitis, which I was found to have, and 
my descent into coma over three and a half hours, I had at best a 10 percent chance of 
survival at the very beginning.  It only got worse.  Mine was an absolutely lethal 
meningitis.  My white cell count in my cerebral spinal fluid was 4,300 and a protein of 
1,340.  Both those numbers should be zero.  In fact, the glucose in that fluid, normally 
60 to 80, and maybe as low as 20 in a severe case of bacterial meningitis, went all the 
way down to one.  None of the consultants in my case, from Harvard, UVA, Duke, or 
Wake Forest had ever seen that severe a case.  My doctors never found a cause.  The 
scan showed diffuse destruction of my neocortex with blurring of the gray-white 
junction over all eight lobes of my brain.  No area was spared.  Later in the week, off all 
sedation, my neurological activity was almost nil.  
 
19:01:12 
 
With what's called a glass glaucoma scale, which in everybody in this room would be 15 
and a corpse is three, my scale was ranging from three to five.  This was a very severe 
meningitis.  On day seven, with no residual neocortical function, brain stem badly 
damaged, reflecting the deadly nature of my illness, my doctors recommended, because 
I was down to a 2 percent chance of survival by that point, with a best case scenario that 
if I survived I'd spend a month or two in the hospital, be transferred to a nursing home, 
and die in a coma months later, hence, they recommended just stopping the antibiotics.  
My journey deep in the coma began in a very primitive unresponsive realm, which I later 
called the "earthworm's eye-view," the best consciousness my brain could muster, 
soaking in pus.  My prior neuroscientific view would've dictated that the next step 
would be one of no awareness at all.  Yet, it was just the opposite, like the blinders 
coming off.  I ascended into far more crisp, vibrant, ultra real realms of pure joy, love, 
and understanding, realms I called the "gateway in the core," far too rich and complex 
to fully describe.  
 
19:02:22   
 
Soon thereafter I started to return to this world, but with my brain so wrecked that I had 
no memory of words or language, nothing of Eben Alexander's life before coma, any 
religious concepts, et cetera, yet I knew the entire ultra-real odyssey that I had just been 
deep in coma, went [spelled phonetically] so extensive it seemed to last for months, 
even though it had to fit within seven days of earth time.  Words came back to me over 
hours and days, childhood memories over weeks, and knowledge of brain-mind 
consciousness of more than 20 years' experience in neurosurgery came back over two 
months.  My doctors have no explanation at all for my full recovery.  Other cases of 
medically inexplicable healing do occur in transcendental near-death experiences, like 
those of Anita Moorjani and Dr. George Rodonaia.  In the 36 hours after emerging from 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

coma, I was in and out of a delusional, paranoid, psychotic nightmare that was 
completely different, not even in the same ballpark, when compared to the ultra-reality 
of the deep-coma experience in the gateway in the core.  
 
19:03:27 
 
Those experiences deep in coma seem almost seem to weigh too real to be real. My 
doctor's believing that the brain creates consciousness, and knowing the destruction 
they had seen in my brain, had told me that I could not have had any such experience in 
the depth of coma, and therefore just to forget about it. I knew I'd experienced 
something and sensed that it had to do with the fundamental flaw in the models of 
consciousness and the -- and the role of the neocortex. Early on, I tried to explain all of 
this as a brain-based phenomenon based on my old paradigm, writing it up as a report 
for the neuroscience literature. It's important that when I was emerging from that 
coma, I saw six faces at the very end. And these were faces that were very important in 
helping me to realize that the entire coma experience happened between Days 1 and 5 
of my coma, and not at the very end. 
 
19:04:20 
 
Over those weeks of recording my experience after coma, I also began to talk with my 
doctors and review my medical records, especially neurological examinations and the 
scans, and came to realize just how deathly ill I was and how there was no way that such 
an ultra-real crisp and vibrant experience could have happened in my physical brain. 
Modern neuroscientific ideas of the neocortex and consciousness would dictate that I 
should have experienced nothing at all beyond that earthworm's eye view. I wrote the 
entire experience down, 20,000 words that I wrote over six weeks, before I read 
anything about near death experiences. I have never read that literature before. 
Initially, I was very worried that the memories would fade. Those memories are as sharp 
today as when they happened. Memories of the delusional paranoid psychotic 
nightmare that occurred over those 36 hours after I came out of coma faded within 
weeks. 
 
19:05:15 
 
Very different origin. I had never read NDE literature before, and was shocked to find 
that the experience seemed hyperreal in over half of NDE accounts, and the memories 
do not fade like those of hallucinations, dreams, confabulations, or drug effects. People 
recount their own NDE stories to me by the hundreds, usually starting -- I'd never told 
anyone this before, but even from over 50 years ago, as if they happened yesterday, I 
came to see that the similarities in the NDE and afterlife literature far outweighed the 
differences. And the commonalities across cultures, beliefs, continents, and millennia 
indicate an underlying constant reality of that realm. Many of the petty differences are 
due to our being so restricted by our earthly language. This is not like we're describing a 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 -

trip to Disneyland. Personal biases and religious beliefs might taint the telling of those 
stories. But the core similarities remain striking.

[applause] 
 
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Eben Alexander. Our motion is Death Is Not Final. And 
here to speak against this motion, Sean Caroll. He is a physicist at the California Institute 
of Technology. He is the author of several books, including "The Particle At The End Of 
The Universe." Ladies and gentlemen, Sean Caroll. 
 
[applause] 
 
Sean Carroll: 
Thanks, John. It's a pleasure to be here defending such a cheerful and uplifting 
proposition, as death is, in fact, final. Driving around the streets of Los Angeles, where I 
live, you can't help but notice these gigantic billboards telling us "All Men Must Die." 
Turns out they were advertisements for "Game of Thrones," but I thought that they 
were advertisements for --  
 
[laughter] 
 
-- our event here tonight. It's a similarly -- you know, not quit as happy message as we 
might like to accept. Fortunately, we can open Dr. Alexander's book. It begins with a 
quote from Albert Einstein. Einstein says, "A man should look for what is, not for what 
he thinks should be," to which I would like to reply, "Exactly."  
 
19:07:20  
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
We human beings are not always perfectly rational. Let me tell this shocking news to 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

you. We are bundles of cognitive biases. And one of the strongest biases we have is that 
we go easy on propositions that we would like to be true. What we should, in fact, do, is 
go especially skeptical on propositions that we would like to be true. And even I want it 
to be true, that death is not final. But we should hold something like that to an 
extraordinarily high standard of evidence. So, what are we actually being asked to 
accept? What should we expect the world to be like if death were not, actually final? For 
one thing, I would expect that the existence of souls persisting in the afterlife should be 
perfectly obvious. It should be just as clear that heaven exists as it is clear that Canada 
exists. But in fact, it seems that the souls persisting in the afterlife are kind of shy.  
 
19:08:17 
 
They don't talk to us, except sometimes they do talk to us. I would expect, also, that 
when people did have near death experiences, and really talked to other souls in the 
afterlife, that they would come back with consistent, interesting, non-trivial stories to 
tell. But in fact, when Christians have near-death experiences, they often say they've 
met Jesus.  When Hindus have near-death experiences, they meet Hindu deities.  There 
was a little girl who had a near-death experience, and she met a portly man wearing a 
red cap.  She met Santa Claus.  And we are told by some defenders of this that, well, 
Jesus dressed up as Santa Claus so as not to scare the little girl.  Possibly, that is true.  
But we should be asking, are there other plausible explanations?  I especially think that 
if we went and had a life after death and then came back to visit us, bringing some 
message back, that message would -- should be as useful as possible.  We are told that, 
you know, people have after death experiences, and they come back saying, you know 
what?  
 
19:09:20 
 
Love is really important.  I agree with that.  But actually, I knew it already.  What I would 
like to know is the cure for Alzheimer's disease.  What I would like to know is something 
that I didn't already know brought back to us.  But it seems that the souls in the afterlife 
tend to speak in platitudes.  The story that we're told of life after death doesn't really 
hang together.  What we have are personal testimonies like that from Dr. Alexander.  So 
people say, with very sincere voices, that what they experienced was totally real.  And I 
have no doubt in the sincerity of this testimony.  What I'm asking is, is it possible that 
our brain is telling us that something was real, but that thing does not actually 
correspond to something that really happened.  And when you ask it that way, the 
answer is obviously yes. 
 
19:10:06 
 
Our brains are fooling us all the time.  Steve Novella, my partner, will tell us about the 
neuroscience behind this.  But basically, our brains are not like video recorders or photo 
albums.  They're more like little theaters.  When we try to remember something, it's 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

much like imagining something that hasn't happened.  It's more like running a script 
than reviewing a tape.  And that's why, when we dream, when we hallucinate, when we 
have a near-death experience, it is just as vivid as something that actually happened.  In 
the legal community, they will tell you that eyewitnesses who tell you that -- have a 
certain sincerity and conviction that their eyewitness testimony is true, that conviction 
is essentially uncorrelated with now true it actually is.  The vividness or reality of a 
memory does not tell us that it was really real.  So what is going on?  We had this 
informal idea that there is a soul that sort of is a blob of spirit energy that takes up 
residence near the brain and drives us around like a soccer mom driving an SUV.  
 
19:11:02 
 
But we've known for a long time that this picture doesn't make sense.  Back in the 
1600s, princess Elizabeth of Bohemia carried on a correspondence with René 
Descarteswho was trying to defend mind-body dualism.  And Elizabeth demands, no, 
how could something immaterial like the soul affect something material like the brain or 
the body?  Descartes was never able to answer that question.  And these days, science 
has gone way beyond that.  We know a lot more about what is happening.  We can 
literally see memories being formed.  We can see the chemical changes in neurons.  So 
the soul is supposed to also have memories.  How do the memories get from the 
neurons to the soul?  We know that brains often have false memories in them.  Does 
the soul in the afterlife carry those false memories, or are they somehow corrected after 
death?  We even know the laws of physics by which the atoms, the electrons, the 
elementary particles in our brains behave.  
 
19:12:01 
 
We know the equations that the electrons that are responsible for chemistry obey.  And 
there's no ambiguity in these equations.  They could always be wrong.  It is always 
possible to say, well, we just don't know what is going on.  That's fine.  But what we 
have is the evidence of every experiment ever done telling us that these equations are 
correct.  To overcome that, we would need very, very strong evidence, just one 
experiment, telling us how the soul is pushing around the chemicals in our brain.  But 
we don't have that.  What science says is that life or consciousness is not a substance 
like water or air.  It is a process like fire.  When you put out the flame on a candle, the 
flame doesn't go anywhere, it simply stops.  And that is what happens when we die.  So 
we're faced at the end with two scenarios.  One scenario says that everything we think 
we understand about the behavior of matter and energy is wrong in a way that has 
somehow escaped notice by every experiment ever done in the history of science. 
 
19:13:04 
 
And instead, there are unknown mechanisms that allow information in the brain to the 
transferred to blobs of spirit energy that persist after we die and can talk to the other 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

blobs of spirit energy, but don't talk to us, expect sometimes they do.  The other 
scenario says that physics is right and that people under stress sometimes have 
experiences that are not actually real.  On the basis of rationality, it not a difficult 
decision to choose between these two options.  On the basis of emotion, it might be 
difficult.  But we need to have the courage to live life here in the actual world.  Thank 
you.

Thank you, Sean Carroll.  And here's where we are.  We are halfway through the 
opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is:  "Death is 
not final."  We have two debaters, two against two, arguing for and against this motion.  
I'm John Donvan, your moderator.  We have heard from the first two debaters and now 
onto the third.  Here to argue for the motion, "death is not final," Raymond Moody.  
He's a medical doctor with a PhD in philosophy, author of numerous books on near-
death experience, including, the seminal "Life After Life."  Raymond Moody.  
 
19:14:11 
 
Raymond Moody: 
Thank you.  Since 1965, I've had the honor of interviewing thousands of people from all 
over the world who had near-death experiences.  And unless you've been hiding in a 
cave somewhere for the last 40 years, you've all heard about this, that people on the 
brink of death tell us that they leave their bodies, and they go into a beautiful light 
which they find very difficult to describe.  And in that light say that relatives or friends of 
theirs who have already died seem to be there to meet them and to help them through 
this transition.  And they have panoramic memory in which they see all of the events of 
their lives displayed around them in a sort of holographic panorama of which they 
witness instantaneously.   
 
19:14:59 
 
My assessment from 40-something years of working on this, and I will underline that 
word "assessment" is that in the words of the proposition, death is not final.  But I want 
to translate a little bit to say that what I'm trying to say with that is that in my opinion, 
at death, personal consciousness is taken up into a more inclusive state of reality or 
frame of existence in a way that people who go through this find it very difficult to put 
into words.  One of the most common things they say is, however articulate they may 
be, they say that this experience is ineffable, or indescribable.  I want to emphasize here 
something at the very beginning.  And please hear me out on this one.  I have decided, 
or sort of assessed the situation, that there is a life after death.

However, I want to say anybody who tells you in the year 2014 that that is a scientific 
matter is not thinking clearly.  In 2014, the question of life after death is not yet a 
scientific question.  I am not a parapsychologist.  And I think parapsychology is a pseudo 
science.  So there's a different frame of reference to think about this, though.  And that 
is that reason is a much bigger category than science.  Scientific method is about, say, 
400 years old.  Reason itself is about 2300 years old, a much bigger institution that 
includes history and philosophy and literary theory and the law in addition to scientific 
thinking.   
 
19:17:00 
 
So what I am suggesting to you is that the solution to the afterlife question is not going 
to come initially from science, but rather from, I think, the whole area of critical thinking 
and logic.  As I look back on the debate that -- on near-death experiences that's gone on 
for almost 2500 years now, what strikes me is that a big part of the problem is that the 
format of the debate is basically twisted.  Since Democritus and Plato fought this out 
2300 years ago, the way we've debated this is we say that some people look at these 
near-death experiences, and they take it at face value, as Plato did, and they say, well, 
this is an indicator of an afterlife.  Other people Democritus being an example, said, as 
Democritus famously did, "There is no such thing as a moment of death," implying that 
therefore what he's getting is that these near-death experiences are just the patient's 
perception of the winding down process of the body.  
 
19:18:12 
 
The trouble with this whole debate is that that format of debate itself is incoherent.  We 
can't keep debating it that way.  Let me give you an indication of why.  All of the 
elements that we think of as a near-death experience, getting out of the body, going 
into this light, seeing a panoramic review of one's life, seeing apparitions of the 
deceased occur very commonly, not just to people who almost die and are brought 
back, but rather to the healthy and uninjured bystanders at the bedside of someone 
else, shared death experiences, as I call these.  As the person in the bed, it's fairly 
common that bystanders will say that they themselves leave their bodies and 
accompany their dying loved ones partway toward this light, or they see the apparitions 
of relatives and friends of the dying person come into the room.  
 
19:19:23 
 
So my question is, if the causation of these near-death experiences is the physiological 
distress and the events going on in the brain, why should the bystanders who are not ill 
or injured have identically the same experience?  So I think that we're into a situation 
with this now where really the problem has sort of outgrown the format that we use to 
debate about it.  In my opinion, we really are on the verge of breakthroughs in the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

genuine, and I will underline "genuine," rational investigation of the question of life 
after death.   
 
19:20:07 
 
And in that context, I think there are two people in history who have more than anyone 
else I think stated this afterlife question very clearly and the major problems that come 
with it, Plato being one, who said that, "Whenever we talk about the afterlife, there's 
always going to be the narrative aspect, a story, because we've got to have some sort of 
story just to get thought about this kind of thing started, but also we've got to have 
some sort of set of concepts to link the -- these narratives with the statement of what -- 
that there is life after death."  I think that's coming.  I think that we are on the brink of a 
breakthrough in rational study of an afterlife, but it's not going to come initially from 
science, but initially from the realms of logic and critical thinking.  So thank you very 
much. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:21:11  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Raymond Moody.  And our motion is, "Death is not final," and here is our 
final debater against this motion, Steven Novella.  He is an academic clinical neurologist 
at Yale University School of Medicine, as well as the host of the weekly science podcast, 
"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe."  Ladies and gentlemen, Steven Novella. 
 
Steve Novella : 
Thank you.  Thanks, John.  I want to say thank you to the Intelligence Squared Debate 
for inviting me here.  It's an honor to be here.  So I'm going to convince you that you 
need to vote against this proposition because if you vote for the notion that death is not 
final then you -- that by necessity means that you are voting against the conclusion, the 
scientific position, that the mind is what the brain does.  The mind is a process of the 
brain itself.  You would have to reject that in order to accept that the mind exists 
without the brain.  Well, how sure are we?  How confident are we in -- as a scientific 
conclusion, which is what we're here to talk about, that the mind is essentially the 
brain? 
 
19:22:06 
 
Well, we're very certain about that, and we're as confident of that as we are of anything 
in science.  We have a mountain of neuroscience, countless experiments, that look for 
the neuroanatomical correlates of consciousness, of the brain functioning, of the mind.  
Everything that you think, feel, believe, is something that's happening inside the brain, 
demonstrably.  But let's take that as a scientific hypothesis.  If the mind is entirely the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

brain, then what must also be true?  Well, then if the arrow of causation's going from 
brain to mind, then if we change the brain, that should change the mind.  And if we 
damage the brain, that should damage the mind.  And if we turn off the brain, that 
should turn off the mind.  Well, if all of those propositions are correct, that strongly 
supports the notion that the mind is essentially the brain, and that is, in fact, exactly 
what scientists have discovered over and over again over the last one to two centuries 
of neuroscience.  
 
19:23:12 
 
I can give you -- I'm a neurologist, so I can give you tons of examples from my own 
personal clinical experience.  But let me just tell you about one very interesting 
neurological phenomenon called Capgras Syndrome.  This is a syndrome in which -- well, 
I'll give you -- I'll back up a little bit.  So when you're looking at, let's say, the face of your 
wife or your spouse, what's forming on your retina is just shapes and shadows and 
colors and lines, but your brain has to construct that into an actual image. But then it 
also have to give meaning to the image. It has to tell you that these shapes are, in fact, a 
face. And then another part of the brain tells you, "That's not just any face. That's the 
face I know well. That's the face of my spouse, the face of my wife." Now, assuming, 
however, you have feelings about your wife -- let's assume that -- then --  
 
[laughter] 
 
 -- there's also a connection between that part of your brain that tells you that that face 
is your wife to the limbic system. That's the emotional part of your brain. And that 
connects your emotions, your feelings about your wife to that image. 
 
19:24:11 
 
So, when you see your wife, those feelings are connected to it. Those are all circuits that 
are happening demonstrably in your brain. Now, in Capgras Syndrome, that last 
connection is broken by a stroke, by damage, by something. So, when someone sees 
their spouse, they recognize them as their spouse. But the feelings aren't there. So, 
what do people conclude when this happens? Well, it's interesting. When people have 
brain damage, it affects how their brain constructs their image of reality, because as my 
-- as Sean was saying, are -- we don't have a tape recorder in our minds, in our brains. 
We are constructing reality and image of reality all the time. It's a very active process. 
And when you -- when that process breaks down, then your construction of reality 
breaks down. So -- and you usually don't have insight into that, especially initially, 
because we tend to assume that our experience is a real, continuous experience. That's 
also something your brain constructs. 
 
19:25:09 
  



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

So, what do people conclude when they have this syndrome, that circuit is broken in 
their brain? They conclude that their wife, their spouse must be an impostor . That's the 
only explanation that they can come up with. There's, in fact, a documented case of a 
husband who murdered his wife because he was convinced that an impostor had 
replaced his wife, you know, with an exact -- you know, it makes no sense, but that's the 
only way his brain could make sense of its broken construction of reality. And there's 
endless examples of this. There's no limit -- there is no practical or functional limit that 
neuroscientists have encountered so far to the degree which we can mess with your 
mind by messing with your brain. Your -- your sense that you're in your body, that you 
control your body, that you separate from the universe -- basic fundamental things 
about your concept of yourself and your experience of reality are all things 
demonstrably happening in the brain, and we could turn it off like a switch. Now we 
actually have the technology to do that. 
 
19:26:08 
 
So, given the mountain of evidence that the mind is the brain, we wouldn't reject this 
easily. Do near death experiences provide such compelling evidence that there is mental 
activity outside of brain activity, that we need to reject the mountain of neuroscientific 
evidence that's growing every day, that tells us that the mind, in fact, is the brain? Well, 
I think the answer there is definitely no as well. There are -- as Sean said, there are 
stories -- anecdotes, compelling narratives. We're all about compelling narratives. That's 
what our brain does -- that people have had very unusual experiences. We don't doubt 
that they have had, you know, life-altering, unusual experiences. Whenever your brain is 
constructing reality in a different way that you're not used to, that's going to be a very 
weird, profound experience. It's going to be memorable. It's going to be amazing. 
Astonishing, even. We have no doubt about that. But it's demonstrably something 
happening in the brain. What we don't have are any documented cases of mental 
activity occurring when there could not be brain activity. 
 
19:27:14 
Now, proponents will often say that, "Well, but the person remembers being, you know, 
in the emergency room, or they remember -- they have these memories that were 
forming while their brain wasn't functioning." But we don't know that. There is no case 
in which that's been documented. They easily could be forming their memories when 
they're coming out of their -- whatever state, whatever coma that they were in. Dr. 
Alexander even says he had a prolonged recovery. We have no idea what was 
happening in his brain during that period of time. When people are in a coma, there's 
still some break activity. There are animal experiments showing that sometimes even 
during an acute stress, there could be even a burst of neural activity. Who knows what 
kinds of astonishing memories are occurring there? We have a reality testing module in 
our brain, a circuit in our brain that says, "This feels real to me." And that testing 
module could break down. And then things -- you don't test reality. It just seems 
hyperreal. Every element of a near death experiment -- experience can be duplicated, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 -

can be replicated with drugs, with anoxia, with lack of blood flow, by turning off circuits 
in the brain. 
 
19:28:21 
 
Every single component is a brain experience that we could now reproduce. And we're 
zeroing in on the exact circuits in the brain which reproduce them. That's why you must 
vote against this proposition. Thank you.  
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Steven Novella. And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. 
Debate, where our motion is Death is not Final. Now we move on to round two.  Round 
two is where the debaters address one another and take questions from me and from 
you in the live audience.  Our motion is this:  Death is not final.  We have two teams of 
two arguing for and against this motion.  We have Eben Alexander and Raymond Moody 
who have made a presentation based very significantly on the personal experience of 
Eben Alexander.   
 
19:29:12 
 
It's an argument based on one very, very compelling anecdote of a guy who's been 
there.  He has seen it, and he is not a gullible guy and never was.  He was trained as a 
scientist.  He comes back saying that consciousness is something that is a lot bigger than 
the brain, that what he experienced could not be explained by brain activity, especially 
given the illness and the state of illness he was in when his brain was functionally 
nonfunctioning.  They're also arguing that there are thousands and thousands of cases 
like this and that there is a consistency to these cases.  At the same time, they say that 
science -- no, science cannot prove that the afterlife exists, but that through the use of 
reason and logic, we can get to that conclusion in a way that laboratory experiments 
cannot.  The team arguing against the motion, Sean Carroll and Steven Novella, they 
agree with their opponents that science cannot prove that there is an afterlife. 
 
19:30:03 
 
But they also say that science can more or less tell us that there is not and cannot be an 
afterlife, that the existence of an afterlife would not fit in with everything else that we 
know about how the way the world works, that there are all sorts of other possible 
biological explanations for the experiences that people come back and describe and that 
psychologically, we're wired to want to believe in the story of an afterlife and that that 
wiring influences the kinds of accounts that come back.  So there are a lot of ways to 
take cuts at the debate -- at this debate based on what we have seen so far.  But I want 
to -- you know, we're going to talk about the power of anecdote, the validity of 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

anecdote.  We're also going to talk a little bit about what we know about brain function 
and the state of brain function.  And I want to start with that point as the opening, as it's 
the thing that we most recently heard Steven Novella talk about.  And I want to go to 
Eben Alexander.  And this debate is not Eben Alexander on trial.  We agree with that.  
But you're the one with the experience.  You've had -- I think you also -- your partner, 
Ray Moody, did you have a near-death experience? 
 
19:31:09  
 
Raymond Moody: 
No. 
 
John Donvan: 
No?  Okay.  I didn't, either, just for the record.  Eben, your opponents are arguing that 
what you said you experienced can be explained by -- by what we already know about 
the brain; that as they put it, you had a real experience about something that was not 
real.  And I think we all understand the logic of what they're saying.  That could be the 
case, could it not be the case? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Well, I think the important thing to point out is I get asked to give a lot of talks at 
medical groups, neurosurgery and other surgical groups, physician groups, because they 
realize the power of the medical situation.  And I think this is what certainly grabbed me 
and challenged me within weeks after my coma is my knowing mybrain mind 
consciousness came back, and I started to review the records to reveal just how sick I 
was.  I think the problem is that any other reason for being in deep coma, I probably 
would have been stuck because usually if there's some part of the neocortex that's still 
working, you could make an argument that that part was part of the process of putting 
it all together.  
 
19:32:17 
 But I think the important thing to point out is, with my neocortex so badly damaged, it 
became very difficult to try and come up with a way to explain how this very rich, 
elaborate set of memories occurred. 
 
John Donvan: 
So in answer to my question, there are -- you're arguing there really can be no other 
possible explanation, that you had a real experience about something that can only be 
real. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Well, it was a very real experience that had no way of occurring in my physical brain.  
Now, initially, I looked at all kinds of possibilities; could it have happened early going in, 
could it have happened coming out, was there some way that other structures in the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

brain or some part of brain was participating and generating this very long, elaborate 
journey?  And yet that's where I kept running into trouble with it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Let's bring it over to Sean Carroll then, where your opponents -- your opponent, 
Eben Alexander is saying that what he experienced can only be explained as a real 
experience.  And Sean Carroll, why don't you respond to that? 
 
19:33:18 
 
Sean Carroll: 
Well, I think that Steven can talk about the specifics that might have been going on in 
the brain.  But my emphasis is on weighing two different comprehensive pictures here.  
We have personal testimony from someone who says he experienced something, and 
it's very real and says that, well, we can't imagine that, even as a neurosurgeon, he just 
doesn't know what could possibly have been going on in his brain that would make that 
happen, therefore let's throw out all of the laws of physics.  And I think that that is not 
nearly enough. 
 
John Donvan: 
Stop right there.  Stop right there.  Eben, is that true? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
No, that's not at all true.  In fact, they still teach quantum mechanics, right? 
 
Sean Carroll: 
They do.  I could teach it right now -- 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Because I think it's important to point out, from my point of view, what drove the 
Founding Fathers at that field into mysticism was the fact that getting at the very depths 
of trying to understand subatomic reality they were led to believe the consciousness, 
the observing mind actually played a role in the unfolding of what was being observed.  
 
19:34:21 
 
And I think that that mystery, to my satisfaction, has not really been solved in a way that 
says that the concerns of people like de Broglie and Dirac, Einstein, Bohr, and others, 
that they were trying to understand how consciousness influenced them. 
 
John Donvan: 
So is your point, for those of us who are just not as well steeped in the conversation 
that's already happening here -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Is your point that there is a kind of reality that you are saying is beyond science, the -- 
total of science that we know now?  Let me ask Raymond.  Raymond, can you move in 
just -- you need to be really right on top of that mic.  Great.  Thanks. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
 
19:35:11 
 
Well, I believe at some point science can be very useful at determining a lot of this. 
 
John Donvan: 
But I'm going to -- and I'm going to move on because I don't want to belabor this topic, 
but -- but what Sean -- what Sean was saying to you was that you're basically saying 
there just cannot be any other explanation other than the one that I have, and therefore 
science really isn't relevant at this point. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
I think that -- in my view, this is all about how understanding the true nature of 
consciousness, soul and spirit, has a lot to do with helping to take physics to the next 
level in terms of understanding -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Thank you.  Sean Carroll. 
 
Sean Carroll: 
The thing about Einstein, Bor, de Broglie, et cetera, the founders of quantum mechanics, 
is that they're all dead, and they have been dead for many decades.  And we know 
what's going on much better now than we did back then.  They were inventing quantum 
mechanics, and occasionally they toyed with the idea that somehow consciousness had 
something to do with the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics.  Now we know 
better. 
 
19:36:02 
 
We know how laws of quantum mechanics help explain how electrons move in the 
brain, and there's nothing in there -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Take 15 seconds and tell us why quantum mechanics has been brought up by your 
opponent, why that has relevance here. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Sean Carroll: 
Well, it's -- I can only quote MIT physicist Scott Aaronson who says, as far as he can tell, 
quantum mechanics is confusing, and consciousness is confusing, so maybe they're the 
same. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Raymond Moody, let's bring you into the conversation. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
You know, really, I think the end reality, what we're dealing with here is not a 
scientifically decidable issue, but a philosophical question.  And what it's called is the 
mind-body problem, probably first articulated in the West by Pythagoras, but there have 
been many, many different theories of it.  The one that's current in the neurosciences is 
called epiphenomenalism, which says, in effect, that there is no independent reality to 
what we experience as consciousness.  But it's a secondary byproduct of the primary 
reality which is the brain and the electrochemical events going on in the brain.  
 
19:37:13 
 
In my opinion, that's a philosophical statement, really.  And my answer is, I don't know.  
I think the mind-body problem is still unresolved. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let's go to your opponent, Steven Novella, who specializes in whether the 
mind is in the brain or not. 
 
Steve Novella : 
I think, you know, Dr. Alexander said that the experience that he remembers -- again, I 
don't doubt he has a memory of a profound experience -- that it could not have 
occurred as he was coming out of his coma.  But you have no basis for that statement, I 
don't think, that you have no sense of time.  Your brain also constructs your sense of 
time.  And when your brain is only partially working, you can have experiences that are 
hyper-real, that are both bizarre, that it's hard for you to reconstruct.  And then your 
memory struggles to sort of construct a narrative that makes sense.  It takes these bits 
and pieces of things that were firing in your head when you were in this semi-conscious 
state, and it constructs a narrative out of it based usually culturally on your pre-existing 
beliefs.  
 
19:38:18 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
You know, near-death experiences, whether, -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Steve Novella : 
 -- as Moody said [unintelligible] in a cave, in a cave [unintelligible] -- 
 
John Donvan: 
You're providing a lot of other ways that what Eben says could have happened -- could 
not have happened any -- okay, so. 
 
Steve Novella : 
Perfectly consistent with what we know about the brain. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to take that back to Eben then.  So your opponent, Steven Novella has just laid 
out many, many scenarios in which you experienced could not -- could have been real to 
you, but not -- not real. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Well, I would say the --  
 
John Donvan: 
-- and what are your responses to his specifics? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Well, the interesting thing to me in looking back on it is the fact that, you know, I started 
for a very long time in what I call this "earthworm eye-view," a very primitive, coarse, 
unresponsive realm that had absolutely no kind of interactivity to it, and yet I remember 
that prolonged period.  And that's what I said earlier is that the next step beyond that 
should have been one of no awareness at all, and yet what really happened was the 
blinders coming off and emerging into this far grander reality that was -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But, I mean, you -- 
 
Eben Alexander: 
-- which was much crisper than my [inaudible] -- 
 
John Donvan: 
-- but your response -- your responses to your opponents' criticisms keep returning to, 
"What I saw, this is what I saw, this is what I experienced," and that's not a response to 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

the point he made, that there are other ways in which you could have seen what you 
saw. 
 
19:39:25 
 So that's what I want you to do, is to respond to Steven Novella's, you know, two or 
three scenarios for ways in which what you experienced may have been generated by 
your ill brain. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Well, to have that be an explanation, one would want at least some part of the 
neocortex still in a state that could participate because all of our modern thinking in 
neuroscience -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
During your recovery -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let him finish.  Go ahead. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
-- is that there really was no part of my brain -- I mean, the factors that showed me 
when it happened, which was between days one and five and not at the end on coming 
out of it, basically those are part of the experience itself that to me were very difficult to 
explain, because they showed that it happened when my doctors told me my brain was 
way too sick to manufacture anything. 
 
19:40:15  
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, so that's a very solid answer.  He's saying his brain was flat.  Nothing, nothing was 
going on, therefore, the kinds of experiences you are saying his brain could have 
generated, they could not have generated.  It was shut. 
 
Steven Novella: 
Well, we don't know and he didn't give an answer to the question of when did those 
memories form?  We don't know.  They were not necessarily happening when you were 
at your worst.  And when you were at your worst, there wasn't the kind of functional 
monitoring that we would've needed to know that your brain was not functioning at all.  
We don't know that.  We saw anatomically, we had edema, swelling, and that certainly 
would have kept you unconscious, but you weren't getting an fMRI, a PET scan, or an 
EEG as far as I could see anything that you've written or said about it that would have 
documented zero brain activity.  You can't say that.  Nobody can say that.  And even 
still, the memories that you have now were not necessarily formed when you were at 
your deepest part of the coma.

19:41:14 
 
They could've been forming in the hours and days when you were coming out of the 
coma.  Then you had a later delusional period, but at different points in time, different 
parts of your brain were working or not working, and you were constructing reality in a 
very bizarre way, in ways that we can reproduce with drugs and hypotension and, you 
know, with electromagnetic stimulation of different parts of your brain. 
 
John Donvan: 
Is that valid, that the entire near-death experience, as described by thousands of 
people, can be recreated by drugs and putting electricity across the brain? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
No, I would say that's not true at all.  There are tremendous examples of people 
encountering souls of departed loved ones, learning information that they couldn't 
possibly learn in any other way.  You had said earlier that there were no cases of any of 
these memories being generated when the brain was out, and yet there are examples of 
that, where the brain -- people under deep anesthesia, with complete circulatory arrest, 
things like that, where they do have some astonishing stories of getting information that 
it doesn't seem to be any other way that they could have gotten it.  So those cases are 
out there. 
 
Steven Novella: 
But those cases are not controlled or documented, so, in other words we don't know 
that they couldn't have gotten that information any other way 
 
19:42:21 
A lot of those cases I've read, that they're like cold readings, you're getting information 
that is either plausible or later was retrofitted to the scenario.  It's all a lot of special 
pleading, the same kind of information you get from a psychic.  It's not controlled 
scientific information.  There are, in fact, attempts at putting controls in place like 
putting playing cards on top of a shelf that could only be viewed if you were actually 
floating above the ceiling.  And to the extent that those have been done, no one has 
been able to demonstrate any information that could only have been obtained while 
they were extracorporeal, floating above their body.  And, by the way, we could make 
you float above your body. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Raymond Moody, did you want to comment or -- I can go back to Eben.

19:43:04 
 
Raymond Moody: 
Yeah, you can go to Eben. 
 
John Donvan: 
Because I actually want to move on to a different point that was made, and that was, 
Sean Carroll, you were making the point that we're wired to want this to be true, we're 
wired to want to -- to shape strange events into narratives and into narratives that we 
particularly like, and my response to that is maybe that's true, but that doesn't 
necessarily mean that's what happened over here.  And there's a little bit of an 
argument, ad hominem thing about it, is you're not a reliable reporter because you just 
want that to be true.  And it's a little bit insulting almost to say, "You can't be trusted 
because you want everything to be happy."  Respond to that. 
 
Sean Carroll: 
Yeah, I hope it's not insulting.  It's certainly not ad hominem because the message is that 
nobody can be trusted. I think that that is part of what science has taught us, that if 
someone makes an extraordinary claim, the very first questions we should be asking 
ourselves are, number one, is there a different, simpler alternative explanation? And 
number two, how would we know if our purported explanation were false?  
 
19:44:03 
 
How would we disprove it? How could we possibly test this idea? And I think that, you 
know, when you look at the bigger picture of how the universe works, how the laws of 
physics work, the enormous success of understanding matter, energy, the brain, life -- 
everything that we've had -- there's just an enormous presumption against the idea that 
somehow, through ways that there are no equations, no experiments, or no direct 
evidence to tell us, the information in our brains persists after we die and is there 
forever and talking to other people who died. So, it's just a matter of presumption. 
There's plenty of things that I would like to be true -- and I have been tricked into 
believing they're true. So, I know that I should be especially skeptical about them. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. Raymond Moody, you're the philosopher on the panel. And you've said that 
this essentially a philosophical question. So, take on what Sean Carroll has just said, 
from the philosophical point of view. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
What I would say about what Sean says is I agree with it up to a point, in the sense that, 
yes, I love physics, too.

19:45:07 
 
 I was an astronomer from the age of seven and so on. And I accept there's a physical 
realm and so on. But that doesn't rule out that there could be a state of being that 
doesn't operate by physical principles. I noticed, Sean, when you were trying to think of 
some other realm, you were thinking in terms of energy or soul substance or whatever. 
But I'm talking about something entirely different. There's no inconceivability in thinking 
that everything that we know is true. And yet, there is a higher dimension or a higher 
domain of existence that sort of -- in which this one is included. 
 
Sean Carroll: 
But this -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Sean Carroll. 
 
Sean Carroll: 
-- I mean, that's -- I think that's a perfect thing to have said in this debate, because it 
illustrates the difference here. 
 
19:46:00 
  
No evidence was given for this claim. No reason to believe it was given. All we are given 
is, "Well, maybe it's true and you can't absolutely disprove it." Maybe it is conceivable. 
We have laws of physics that tell us how the moon moves around the earth. And they 
work very well. It is conceivable that there are also angels living inside the moon, gliding 
it around in exactly the way that Newton's Laws tell us. But we don't take that seriously 
as an idea, because there's no need for it or evidence for it. So, the question is not is it 
conceivable that there are other realms. The question is, is the evidence in favor of that 
other realm so overwhelming that it causes us to dismiss the enormous successes of 
physics, chemistry, biology and neuroscience? 
 
Raymond Moody: 
No. I would say absolutely not. It doesn't require you to dismiss the findings of science 
to – 
 
Sean Carroll: 
Come over here to this side. We'll welcome you. We'll put your chair over here --  
 
[laughter]

Raymond Moody: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And yet, you know, I think it's entirely conceivable that there's some other domain of 
existence over this that some people gain access to it sometimes. 
 
19:47:11 
 
And I know hundreds and hundreds of them. 
 
Sean Carroll: 
And how would we know if there weren't? 
 
Raymond Moody: 
You know something? You're right about the false of viability problem, Sean. That's very 
big in the afterlife question. But I think the way that this is going to work out is that 
what we need to do is prepare people in advance, before they ever have a near death 
experience, in new ways of thinking about these things. You know, the standard -- the 
standard objection to mystical experience has always been -- as A.J. Ayer  put it -- that if 
the mystic tells us that he can't possibly describe what he experienced, then he's got to 
admit that he's talking unintelligibly when he talks about it. And that's the problem that 
we can change, because I think it's -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But -- but Raymond -- but your argument said -- and I'm not taking sides on this, but my 
role in this, to some degree, is to push the arguments on both sides.  
 
19:48:15 
 
You were -- what you were saying sort of reminds me of the editorial to Virginia about 
Santa Claus, written in the 19th century, in which Francis Church wrote this editorial, 
said to the little girl, "Do you see fairies dancing on the front lawn? No, of course you 
don't, but that doesn't mean that they're not there." And I feel, to some degree, that's 
the argument you're presenting is -- "No, we can't prove it, but that doesn't mean it's 
not real." 
 
Raymond Moody: 
What my argument -- 
 
John Donvan: 
And I just need you, again, to come close to the mic. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
Yes. Yes. My argument is that when thousands and thousands of people whose 
judgment I trust and other -- in all other circumstances, a lot of medical friends -- 
 
John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Okay.  Give us one example, because I know you've written about this, examples where 
people who were not the person lying in the bed, but other people -- 
 
Raymond Moody: 
Okay. 
 
John Donvan: 
 -- had an experience.  And let the other side respond to that. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
Okay. 
 
John Donvan: 
And just lean into that mic. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
And artist I met a couple of years ago, Jeff Olson, by name, a very well-known graphic 
artist, had a horrific car crash in which he lost his leg, he -- his wife was killed instantly, 
and he had a profound near-death experience. 
 
19:49:28 
 
As he was thinking about this, what am I going to do about this?" his doctor had not 
been informed about this.  So he decided to write this story up, and then he wanted to 
use the name of his doctor.  So he called the doctor and invited him to lunch.  The 
doctor came and Jeff told him the store I have his near-death experience, whereupon 
the surgeon said, "Well, I've never told anybody this, but that night you were in the 
hospital I knew that you weren't going to die.  Your wife was talking with me in the 
surgery room.  And the --" 
 
John Donvan: 
His dead wife. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
Yes. 
 
19:50:16 
 
And so did the scrub nurse also had an experience of vivid sense of presence and seeing 
the -- so my point here is that it's not proof, but at a certain point, you know, where do 
you draw the line and -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.

Raymond Moody: 
 -- give people respect? 
 
John Donvan: 
So you put an example out there where it's not simply about the brain activity of the 
person lying in the bed, but that the notion of an afterlife represented by this 
apparition, we are talking about ghosts now, and I'm sorry that sounded pejorative, but 
we are talking about something that a lot of people would challenge as incredibly 
implausible.  But you’re making the argument seriously, so I want your opponents to 
respond to it seriously. 
 
Steven Novella: 
Well, we want to know what's really, really true, not just what seems to be true, what 
we want to be true.  And, you know, again, our brains are narrative generating 
machines.  It tries to construct a story that makes sense to us, appeals to us, stream -- 
puts everything together seamlessly.  And you know, we can have what we believe -- we 
have memories of experiences that mean something to us, but don't really relate to 
reality.  We know this is true. 
 
19:51:23 
 
If you accept that level of evidence -- and this is not about respect.  I believe that people 
have these memories of these experiences.  It's just about the interpretation of them. 
 
John Donvan: 
Are you talking about the scrub nurse and the doctors? 
 
Steven Novella: 
Anyone.  I mean, think about it. 
 
John Donvan: 
But these scrub nurse and doctors were at separate -- met this woman at separate 
places, right, on the same night. 
 
Steven Novella: 
But all we have is a story constructed after the fact.  We have similar stories about 
people being abducted by UFOs, seeing big foot, any weird kind of experience you can 
imagine.  If you accept this level of evidence, then you have to believe every paranormal 
claim out there because we have that level of evidence for thousands of stories that are 
conflicting in mutually exclusive, often culturally dependent.  It's simply not acceptable.  
And we know -- we know for a fact that the brain can absolutely manufacture those 
memories, come to absolutely believe a story like that, that's absolutely not true.

John Donvan: 
I want to go to audience questions.  And while you're raising hands, I just want to ask 
very, very quickly for Eben Alexander, do we know that the brain can manufacture those 
experiences? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
I would say the brain does not create consciousness.  That is something a lot of 
scientists, those interested in neuroscience are far along that pathway.  Now it's called 
the hard problem of consciousness.  In fact, no neuroscientist on earth can give the first 
sentence to explain the mechanism by which the physical brain creates consciousness. 
 
[applause] 
 
Steve Novella : 
We don't have to know how the brain creates consciousness. 
 
John Donvan: 
Steven Novella. 
 
Steve Novella : 
In order to know that it creates consciousness.  That it creates consciousness, we 
absolutely know, just like we don't have to know how the earth generates gravity to 
know that it generates gravity. There's no question we have gravity even though we 
haven't untangled the deepest understanding of every possible thing. 
 
19:53:05   
So yes, we don't know exactly how the brain creates consciousness, but the evidence 
can only lead to one interpretation, that it is consciousness.  The consciousness is what 
the brain does, no question. 
 
John Donvan: 
Eben Alexander. 
 
[applause] 
 
Eben Alexander: 
As I said, no neuroscientist on earth can give the first sentence to explain a mechanism 
by which the physical brain gives rise to consciousness. 
 
Steve Novella : 
But not knowing the mechanism -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
John Donvan: 
Is that -- is that true? 
 
Steve Novella : 
I don't -- I disagree with that because there are -- there's consciousness research.  There 
are researchers who are doing a very good job of making progress of understanding 
consciousness as a neurological phenomenon.  We certainly are not all the way there of 
understanding exactly what it is.  It's a very difficult nut to crack.  But that we are not at 
the -- but not knowing the mechanism is not the same thing as saying it's not possible, 
or it's impossible, or we need a nonphysical mechanism.  We certainly don't. 
 
John Donvan: 
Given that point, but is he accurate that we don't know the mechanism by which the 
brain gives rise to consciousness? 
 
19:54:06 
 
Steve Novella : 
Well, it's not a black or white thing.  We have some knowledge.  We don't have 
complete knowledge about it.  It's like saying, do we understand -- do we understand 
everything about genetics?  No.  But we know that DNA is the molecule of inheritance.  
That's not questionable. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
But not one sentence.  Give the first sentence of how you would trace from the physical 
brain that it gives rise to consciousness. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's go to some audience questions.  Right down front here.  A mic will come to you.  I 
didn't explain this before.  A mic will come to you.  And if you can stand up, tell us your

Hello.  Hi.  My name is Arthur Kramer.  My question is to the panel arguing for the 
motion.  If a person was to take a strong hallucinogen, let's say LSD, and they were to 
have a very distorted experience, hallucinations, would you accept their version of 
reality, or would you just merely dismiss it as them having an experience because of -- 
 
John Donvan: 
That was a perfect formed question.

John Donvan: 
And very relevant.  Which of you would like to take it?  Raymond Moody. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
Yeah, I think William James was kind of right about that, that whatever experience one 
has one can say that by definition almost there's some correlated state of the central 
nervous system.  The question of reality is an entirely different question.  Can I imagine 
that maybe by taking some substance someone could gain access to some other kind of 
reality?  Yes, I can imagine that.  However, I think it boils down to the particular, doesn't 
it?  I think you have to look at a much broader set of information to make a -- but 
generally speaking, yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
I don't think this side needs to add to that.  I think your side was in the question.

Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sir.  You were starting to stand up.  Well, you too.  I'll come back to you. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Richard Spencer.  I've got a question for Eben and specifically about the issue of other 
people having experiences.  Eben, in your experience, you seem to have met your 
biological sister who you had never met before or seen a picture of.  And I gather from 
your book that you actually drew a picture of her or somehow had a picture done 
before you subsequently had an actual picture of who she was, which you learned later.  
I'd like you to describe that in a little bit and say if in fact you -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to pass on that question because it's not going to -- I don't think it's going to 
advance our understanding of whether science relates to this or not, but thanks very 
much.  Ma'am in the center there.  Is your book on sale in our lobby?  I like always being 
able to say that. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
I have no idea.  It should be out there somewhere.

19:57:17  
Female Speaker: 
Okay.  Hi.  My name is Eleanor.  And I have a question for this side as well.  I did read 
both of your books, by the way, which are super interesting.  But it left me with a 
question which hasn't been answered yet, so why wouldn't everyone that experiences a 
death experience or a near-death experience have one of these experiences? 
 
John Donvan: 
Right.  It's about one out of ten or one out of eight, something like that. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Right.  Why wouldn't -- 
 
John Donvan: 
 -- who comes back. 
 
Female Speaker: 
 -- more people have -- and why is there no mention of hell?  It's all about heaven, which 
could be a good thing.  But -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
I think this side has an answer to that question. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Eben Alexander, would you like to take that? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Well, I think that, to me, is a very interesting question.  The number out there is roughly 
15 percent, 20 percent of people who have a medical situation that might lead to a 
near-death experience, about 15 to 20 percent seem to report them.  That's a historical 
figure that I think is probably low because it comes from an era when we weren't asking 
people to volunteer that kind of information.  
 
19:58:16 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

I think the actual number is probably higher.  If I had just come back from my 
earthworm eye view, you know, that very prolonged initial phase, that very dumbed-
down consciousness that I think was the best my brain could do, I would have had a 
hellish NDE.  Turns out that hellish NDEs are probably, what -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Just remind people. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
 -- 3 or 4 percent. 
 
John Donvan: 
NDE stands for near-death -- 
 
Eben Alexander: 
A near-death experience.  And the hellish ones are quite rare by comparison, 3 or 4 
percent.  My own feeling is that that is because they're incomplete, that souls don't go 
in with quite the oomph and that exactly in my case, I went in with plenty of oomph and 
went through that phase and up into the much higher levels of ultra-reality. 
 
John Donvan: 
I think the other side should get a crack at this question and why it's only one out of 
eight or one out of 10 people who have had these experiences, [unintelligible]. 
 
Steven Novella: 
Yeah, I mean, it’s perfectly compatible with the neuroscientific hypothesis of these 
experiences depends on what parts of your brain are working and not working at any 
given moment.  What's the mechanism of your being in a coma or unconscious?  Was it 
traumatic?  Was it lack of oxygen?  
 
19:59:14 
You know, we could put pilots in a centrifuge, spin them up until they pass out -- a lot of 
them have near-death experiences, too, they're not near death, but we're depriving 
their brain of blood flow -- you know, with similar numbers, very, you know, profound, 
memorable, vivid experiences.  So it just depends on the particulars of what parts of the 
brain are working or not working. 
 
John Donvan: 
And nobody's seeing hell, whew.

there's actually a reality to that realm, to those lower spiritual realms, that you can see

it's something that's been referred to for a long time.

information that the people having the experience gained through no other mechanism.

So -- and there are experiments ongoing -- preliminary ones have been negative, there 
are bigger ones ongoing -- to see if people could, for example, look up on the top shelf 
and see a card that's placed there, that you could only see if you were actually floating 
above, near the ceiling, so that would be compelling evidence.  I mean, it would need to 
be enough to -- that would be enough to me to at least take it seriously, but then to be -
- to say that it's probably true, you need as much evidence as we have for the 
neuroscientific model which says it's not possible. 
 
John Donvan: 
Steven Novella, could you be convinced?  Is there any piece of evidence that would 
convince you that there's an afterlife?

I could be convinced of anything if the evidence were sufficient. 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm sorry, I meant to ask your partner, but thank you for your answer.  Sean Carroll, 
would -- could you be convinced? 
 
Sean Carroll: 
Yeah, I think that -- you know, the idea that we could be convinced of another realm in 
addition to the natural world is obviously, "Yes."  There's a million pieces of evidence 
that would help convince me.  None of -- I mean, if this -- if there's a ghost in the room 
that could lift up that glass right now, then I would be convinced.

John Donvan: 
Move to the light. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Female Speaker: 
I'm Andrea, hello.  I wanted to ask a question to the pro side, which is what is your 
definition of "final," because in your description of what it was like in this what you 
called sort of a transcendental state you were feeling things but it didn't seem as if you 
could do anything, as if you were really talking to anyone.  So I wanted to know what 
your definition of "final" is. 
 
John Donvan: 
How will that help you vote on the motion seriously? 
  
Female Speaker: 
Because, you know, the motion is "Death is not final," so [unintelligible] -- they have to 
convince me that there's something beyond when the body, you know, decomposes 
into the earth, so that doesn't end what we know to be life, so I wanted to know -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But I think -- I'm going to pass because I think that's the thrust of their entire argument 
is that, that -- unless I'm really missing your point, [unintelligible] have argued is that 
"Death is not final."  Am I missing something? 
 
20:03:19  
 
Female Speaker: 
I just -- oh, I had hoped for some clarification on their definition of "final," but if it seems 
as if -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to pass on it because I think -- [inaudible] right down there.  Okay. 
 
Male Speaker: 
I'm Michael, and, Dr. Moody, in your opening comments you said that we -- you believe 
we're on the verge of understanding through philosophy and logic this other realm. Can 
you elaborate on that? 
 
Raymond Moody: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Yes. I think that probably about one out of five people I meet socially -- and when the 
conversation develops, "So, what do you do?" "I write books on near death experiences" 
-- about one out of 10 people say, "Oh, I don't believe in life after death. When you're 
dead, you're dead." 
 
20:04:13 
Then I go on and I ask them, "Well, how did you reach that conclusion?" Most of them 
say, "What are you talking about in the first place, life after death? It's just illogical." And 
you know, the sentence "There is life after death" is a self-contradiction, if you look up 
the words in the dictionary. And this may sound trivial, but this is really a major 
problem, because that -- it helps us understand why life after death is not yet a scientific 
question. Question is one of intelligibility. What does it mean? And the person, I think, 
who stated that point of view most eloquently was David Hume, who said, "By the mere 
light of reason it seems difficult to prove the immortality of the soul." Then he went on 
to say, "Some new species of logic is requisite for that purpose. 
 
20:05:11 
And some new faculties of the mind that they may enable us to comprehend that logic." 
That sounds like a tall order, but it's not really that difficult. The trouble is that you have 
to stop thinking about stories for a while and beautiful narratives, and really get busy 
with some conceptual thinking. But when that's all said and done, I think that we do 
now have new ways of thinking about things that are illogical that will open up entirely 
new ways to investigate the afterlife question. This is not geared to the afterlife, per say. 
What somebody who wants to go through this pathway has to do -- first is to say, "What 
I'm going to focus here is on learning new logical principles and going through a process 
of learning." Then, as a corollary, much later down the road, this has implications for the 
afterlife question. 
 
John Donvan: 
We're going -- we're going to book you in about seven years and see where that -- see 
where that process is. Let me go to more questions. Sir? 
 
20:06:22  
 
Male Speaker: 
My name's Rob. My question is for the Against side. Thank you. How can you be so sure 
about your position when you base it upon what we now know in science -- and by the 
mere fact of what we now know, we're constantly evolving in science? So, how can you 
base -- be so sure about your position when science may learn things that we don't yet 
know? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Well, I mean -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 -

John Donvan: 
That's a pretty -- that's a pretty good question. 
 
Male Speaker: 
That's a good question. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah.  
 
[applause] 
 
Steven Novella. 
 
Steve Novella : 
So, as I said -- as I was saying, I'm a skeptic, so I'm in a perpetual state of doubt about 
everything. I need lots of evidence and logic to convince me. And all we could say within 
the scientific realm is what does the best evidence tell us today? Right now, we have 
lots of evidence that we could be highly confident in the conclusion that the mind is 
what the brain does. And we have no compelling evidence -- only narratives and really 
dubious evidence to -- against that proposition, against that notion, or for the notion 
that there is some consciousness separate from the brain. So, the scientific conclusion 
today is that the mind is the brain. 
 
20:07:27 
 
If new, dramatic evidence comes to light that changes that, I will happily move along 
with the evidence. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sean Caroll, take a crack at the same question. 
 
Sean Carroll: 
I think -- you know, it's a great question because there's this image -- like, when we're 
teaching high school and science, that it's a bunch of facts that are absolutely 
established, whereas professional scientists like to brag about the fact that -- like Steven 
just said -- that, you know, we're always skeptical and we're always ready to throw out 
everything. And both are true, but because there's some intermediate ground. There 
are many, many things that science does not understand, and we're hoping to get better 
at it. Many, many things. And there are also some things that science does understand 
and are not going to go away. This table is made of atoms. We will improve our 
understanding of what an atom is, what the elemental particles and fields are that make 
it up, how they interact. That is not finished yet.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

20:08:13 
 
We can do better. But a million years from now, our best scientific understanding will 
still say that the table is made of atoms. In my judgment, the current status of our 
scientific understanding, the parts that we're not going to give up, are enough to 
conclude that death is, in fact, final.  
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to remind you, we are in the question and answer section of this Intelligence 
Squared U.S. Debate.  
 
[laughter] 
 
I'm John Donvan, your moderator. We have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing it 
out over this motion -- death is not final. Did somebody come downstairs? He did. I see 
standing there. Again, I need you to walk to the light. Thank you. A little bit more just so 
that the camera can see you.  Great.  Terrific, thank you. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Hi.  My name is Jessica.  We've been talking a lot tonight about personal experiences 
and self-created memories of near-death experiences, whether those are real or just 
crafted by the mind.  But I want to know what the against side has to say about 
admittedly self-proclaimed psychic mediums, or people completely removed from the 
situation that seem to have knowledge of events that they were not present for. 
 
20:09:20  
 
John Donvan: 
I think that's relevant because your opponents have actually brought up situations like 
that.  So let's go ahead.  Thanks for the question.  Sean Carroll. 
 
Sean Carroll: 
Yeah, I mean, I think that, again, there is evidence in favor of those kinds of things.  
There is other evidence against those kinds of things.  And the kind of remote seeing or 
telepathy or telekinesis or clairvoyance that is being talked about here is in utter and 
complete violation with everything we understand about the current laws of physics.  
So,  if something is seeing something, it has to be able to absorb photons.  How does 
that happen?  I think that there's, again, an overwhelming presumption that stuff that is 
in so flagrant violation with everything we understand about the fundamental way that 
matter and energy works better have amazingly good evidence in favor of it.  And the 
evidence in favor of psychic phenomena comes nowhere near that standard.

John Donvan: 
Eben? 
 
Steven Novella: 
Even if we put plausibility aside, a hundred years of parapsychological research has not 
been able to produce one bit of compelling replicable evidence that shows that it's a 
real phenomenon. 
 
20:10:21  
 
John Donvan: 
So, Eben Alexander, that sounds like the most powerful salvo against your side yet.  So 
what is your response to that? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
My response is that the evidence for things like telepathy, precognition, remote 
viewing, out of body experiences, past life memories in children, the afterdeath 
communications is overwhelmingly positive evidence that it exists and is real.  For those 
out there in the scientific -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Eben Alexander: 
 -- community who want to know more, I would urge them to check the book, 
"Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century," 800 pages of very dense 
science data and analysis that shows the absolute reality of nonlocal consciousness in all 
of those forms.  It shows that we have a long way to go in beginning to understand 
anything about consciousness and that the model that brain creates consciousness and 
that we can only know things locally with our connected senses is completely false and 
disproven by a lot of scientists, not just in that book, and those who participated in that, 
but in multiple other books. 
 
20:11:26 
 
And, I mean, for example, the afterlife experiments Dr. Gary Schwartz, that's a pretty 
powerful documentation of the power of mediums.  There are -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Two sentences, what were they so we have something concrete for those of us who 
have not read the book, which is a lot of people. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
I'm sorry.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
John Donvan: 
Of Gary Shwartz’s experiments.  Give a two-sentence example of what he did. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Basically, did a scientific assessment of mediums and their ability to work especially with 
-- 
 
John Donvan: 
And showed what?  Established what? 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Well, established that they could communicate and know things that only could be 
known by the departed relative. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  So your opponents are saying that there are scientific experiment that's prove 
paranormal activity is valid, happens, it's real.  Steven Novella. 
 
Steve Novella : 
Demonstrably not true.  I mean, everything you said is the exact opposite of the truth. 
 
[applause] 
 
20:12:19  
 
 
Gary Schwartz's methodology was massively flawed.  It's been absolutely picked apart 
by other scientists.  He essentially allowed himself to be bamboozled by charlatans and 
by cold readers.  He did not produce anything reliable, anything that I would consider to 
be credible scientific evidence. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Steve Novella : 
So that's the bottom line. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah.  Eben, do you want to respond to that, or should we move on? 
 
Eben Alexander: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 45 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Well, simply to say, I guess with this kind of thing maybe we're at a bit of an impasse 
because I think that his methodology was actually quite solid.  I've met mediums who 
have convinced me very strongly they're absolutely real. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  There are moments in these debates where we reach impasse, and we move 
on, and we have just done that.  Ma'am.  Mic -- microphone is coming to you. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Hi.  My name is Stephanie.  So it feels like we are conflating two different questions, and 
one is whether the mind and consciousness come from the brain, and the other is 
whether there exists an afterlife. 
 
20:13:16 
And I don't understand why the existence of an afterlife would show up in the brain.  
And so I'm wondering, for the -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to clarify you -- after you, and then move on.  The argument that's being made 
by the team arguing against the motion is that life stops when the brain dies, and that's 
why those two things have become conflated.  And I think it fits pretty -- together pretty 
well.  Right down in front, ma'am. 
 
Female Speaker: 
[inaudible] 
John Donvan: 
You need the mic too. 
 
Female Speaker: 
My name is Jane, and my question is for the opposing side.  We have energy while we're 
alive.  Where does our energy go when we die? 
 
Sean Carroll: 
It doesn't go away.  It's up in your head.  They're just not continuing to live.  It's exactly 
the same place the flame goes when you put out the candle. 
 
John Donvan: 
Does the other side want to -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Does the other side want to take on the candle argument or -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Eben Alexander: 
I would say it's more a question of the information, you know, than the energy.  It's not 
a conservation issue around energy.  
 
20:14:13 
 
People often use that one to argue against a soul being able to influence the material 
world.  I would say it's much more a question of the information, and especially when 
you -- as I said, when you -- for example, a very renowned skeptic and scientist, Carl 
Sagan  admitted that past life memories in children, the evidence for that is 
overwhelming. 
 
Steven Novella: 
That's not true.  Come on, Carl Sagan, please. 
 
Eben Alexander: 
He said that in his book, in his book, "The Demon Haunted World," on page 302, he says 
exactly that. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Steven Novella: 
I've read that book a hundred times.  Carl Sagan did not believe in past lives.  He did not 
believe in anything paranormal or supernatural.  That is just not true. 
 
John Donvan: 
Impass on Carl Sagan.  Question down front. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Okay.  Building on the past lives, I wanted to preface my question by saying I'm a 
student of Dr. Brian Weiss who is an expert in past life memories.  
 
20:15:06 
 
My question is actually for the against.  I recently became aware of a study by a man 
named Dr. Kenneth Ring who had done research around near-death experiences for 
people who were born in this lifetime blind.  And they described having experiences of 
seeing and describing color and describing paintings and the color of the carpet.  How 
can you explain that?  Is there some kind of brain mapping that happens, you know, 
that's inherently human that doesn't, you know, involve needing that particular sense? 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Female Speaker: 
How can you explain that? 
 
John Donvan: 
I [unintelligible] that question.  Go ahead.  Who would like to take it, Steven Novella? 
 
Steve Novella : 
Yeah, I mean, I haven't read that particular study, so I don't have any detailed 
information about the specifics, or I'd certainly be interested in taking a look at it.  But 
just the notion that somebody can explain something beyond their experience is not 
unusual.  We are actually pretty creative, inventive people.  You know, our human 
brains have no problem inventing things that we haven't directly experienced.  So again, 
I would need to see details that could not be explained as a brain experience in order to 
find it compelling. 
 
John Donvan: 
And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our 
motion is "death is not final." 
 
20:16:18 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And now we move on to round three.  In round three, we will have closing statements 
by each debater in turn.  They will be two minutes each.  And remember how you voted 
at the beginning of the debate because immediately after their closing statements, you 
will vote a second time, and the team whose numbers have changed the most in 
percentage point terms will be declared our winner.  On to round three, closing 
statements by each debater in turn.  Our motion is "death is not final."  And here to 
summarize his position supporting the motion that death is not final, Eben Alexander, 
an academic neurosurgeon and author of the bestselling book, "Proof of Heaven." 
 
Eben Alexander: 
Well, I would like to go back to what Sean had said about how consciousness is very 
confusing to us as is quantum mechanics.  And I would put out there, I think they're 
related. There's a reason why they're both so confusing. 
 
20:17:13 
 
And that's -- you can chuckle, but in fact, that's what drove brilliant people like Einstein 
and others into mysticism.  And in fact, I would say that that mystery has only gotten 
much deeper over time.  We have not answered that at all.  In support of my claim 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

earlier about brain damage allowing enhanced function, which really goes against the 
materialist model that Steven talked about earlier, I point out two very common 
examples in clinical practice; acquired savant syndromes, in which strobe brain trauma, 
autism, can allow super human mental function, something that's often seen, that 
certainly has no explanation from the brain makes mind model; and also terminal 
lucidity, in which demented elderly patients often have periods of great clarity, 
especially around the time that they are encountering souls of departed loved ones that 
are there to escort them over.  And I would say that these very commonly observed 
phenomena really demand a much deeper model of consciousness than we get out of 
the materialist models.  
 
20:18:15 
 
I'll point out that Dr. Wilder Penfield wrote a book in 1975, "The Conscious Mind."  He 
probably still holds the record for having stimulated the brain in awake patients more 
than any other neurosurgeon.  And never once did he duplicate any kind of situation of 
free will.  He concluded very strongly that the mind consciousness is not created in the 
physical brain.  And I think it's important to point out that the pure materialism fails.  It's 
a hard problem of consciousness and at the enigma of quantum mechanics, that the 
brain actually confines and limits consciousness, that science acknowledging 
consciousness, soul and the spirit becomes much stronger than the overly simplistic 
science of reductive materialism.  Death of the physical brain and body is not final.  
Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Eben Alexander. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that is our motion, "Death is not final."  And here to argue against the motion, 
Steven Novella.  He's a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine and founder of science 
based medicine. 
 
20:19:14 
 
Steve Novella : 
So up until a couple hundred years ago, every culture in the world believed that there 
was a life energy.  They knew intuitively, they sensed that there was something 
fundamentally different about living things from nonliving things, and they hypothesized 
that there must be some energy, some [unintelligible] vital, spiritus, chi, whatever you 
call it, that fundamentally makes living things different than nonliving things.  But over 
the next 100, 150 years, basically the 19th into the 20th century, we discovered 
biochemistry and genetics and developmental biology, and all different principles of 
biology, until essentially there was nothing left for the life force to do.  We had 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

explained everything that living organisms do, and we explored the blurry line between 
living and nonliving, and we realized that there is no fundamental difference there.  It's 
just, as you get increased complexity at some point you cross this fuzzy line, and you're 
doing a process that we call "life."  Well, we're kind of going through the same process 
though maybe a little bit delayed with consciousness.  
 
20:20:09 
You -- we understand that the brain causes consciousness.  We certainly don't 
understand a lot about how it is produced exactly.  But we're making progress.  Our 
research paradigms are working quite well, thank you, and we're making lots of 
progress.  It's just as irrational, if you will, to hypothesize that there is some magical 
energy or some non-corporeal thing, stuff, that is consciousness, as it was 200 years ago 
to say that, "Well, because we can't explain life, then we need a life force."  We don't 
need a brain force, a mind force any more than we needed a life force 200 years ago.  
The fact is that the neuroscientific community is progressing relentlessly with the 
paradigm that is materialist, reductionist.  We're looking for neuroanatomical correlates 
of everything that the mind does, and that research program is very, very successful.  
And it -- how well an idea advances in science is more telling about how valuable it is, 
how true it is, than what our current state of knowledge is.   
 
20:21:08 
 
Our current state of knowledge is always going to be incomplete.  It doesn't mean that 
our ideas are wrong or are weak.  That's why you have to vote against this proposition. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Steven Novella. 
 
[applause] 
 
And the proposition is, "Death is not final."  And here to summarize his position in 
support of the motion that "Death is not final," Raymond Moody, he's a medical doctor 
and author of the book, "Life After Life," in which he coined the term, "Near-death 
experience."  Raymond Moody. 
 
Raymond Moody: 
First of all, I want to say that to me to this day the notion of life after death is very 
counterintuitive.  I think as a nonreligious person I had no background in that.  It never 
occurred to me, as a young astronomy buff, that there might be something beyond this.  
I've been through a process now of 40+ years that finally drove me into this situation 
where I'm sort of forced to say, almost against my will, that "Death is not final," there is 
a life after death.  
 
20:22:16 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Basically what happened to me was that hearing thousands of people with near-death 
experiences, hundreds of people with shared death experiences who had the identical 
experience we call a near-death experience, except they weren't ill or injured, they were 
simply there at the bedside of someone else who died, and I have seen joint 
transcendent experiences where, for example, a physician and a critically ill patient 
would have some sort of joint transcendent experience at the same time.  That leads me 
to be forced almost into a position to say that I trust these people's judgment.  It seems 
to me that they've been somewhere where I haven't been, and I can begin to put a little 
picture together of what they're talking about.  So for that reason I would say I'm 
onboard.  I think there is life after death. 
 
20:23:20 
 
So vote, vote, vote for the afterlife. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
And -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Raymond Moody.  Our motion is, "Death is not final," and here to summarize 
his position against the motion, Sean Carroll.  He's a theoretical physicist at the 
California Institute of Technology and author of, "The Particle at the End of the 
Universe." 
 
Sean Carroll: 
When I was about six years old, I had an emotional formative experience that 
apparently many other people share similar things.  I was in bed, you know, going to 
sleep, sort of thinking about the day and so forth, and I started crying. I was just bawling 
uncontrollably, so much so that my mom heard me from her bedroom and came 
running in, saying, "What is wrong?" And I said, "Some day, our grandmom is going to 
die. And someday, you're going to die. And someday, I'm going to die. We're all going to 
die." 
 
20:24:17 
 
And you know, she had to explain, "Well, yes." And so forth. And she had her own 
version of the story. And the reason I'm telling this story because even as convinced as I 
am that death is final, I have absolutely no desire to belittle the people in the room who 
disagree, who feel the other way. This is an incredibly important, central issue to our 
lives. I personally am convinced by the overwhelming scientific evidence from physics, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

from neuroscience, et cetera, that there is one world, the natural world. Biology is a 
process that can end. And death is final. And to me, that fact -- the finitude of our lives -- 
gives enormous poignancy and importance to the finite number of years that we have 
here on earth. Our lives here are not dress rehearsals. This is the act. This is the one 
performance that we get. That does not remove meaning or value from the lives we're 
leading now. 
 
20:25:17 
 
It gives -- it forces us to give meaning to everything we do, because we only have a finite 
number of things to do. If evidence came in on the other side, I would change my mind 
quickly, if the evidence was good enough. But I think that we're past the point where it's 
a scientifically interesting question. I think that we know enough to conclude that death 
is final. And personally, I think that that is okay. Thank you.  
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you. Sean Caroll. And that concludes closing statements.  
 
[applause] 
 
And now it's time to learn which side has argued best. We're going to ask you to go 
again to the keypads at your seats and vote for the second time. And it will be the 
difference between the first and second vote by you, our audience members here in 
New York, that will determine our winner. The team whose numbers have changed the 
most will be the team that wins. Our motion is Death is Not Final.  
 
20:26:18 
 
Okay. Are we good? We can lock out the system. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Which numbers? 
 
John Donvan: 
Oh, numbers are the same as before. If you are for the motion, push #1. If you are 
against the motion, push #2. And if you became or remain undecided, push #3. And you 
can ignore the other -- the other keys. The other numbers are nothing. I'll give it another 
15 seconds. And my apologies for that. Okay. It looks like everybody's good. So, while 
we're waiting for the calculation to come in, I just want to say this. You know, Sean 
Caroll just made the point in his closing statement very, very brilliantly, about -- this is 
not a debate that in any way was meant to disrespect anybody.

And in fact, that would go very much against the spirit of Intelligence Squared, which -- 
it's goal is to raise the level of public discourse. And what I heard, not only from Sean 
Carroll, but from all four of these debaters, were four people who disagreed vehemently 
on something very personal, meaningful, and metaphysical. And yet, they did it in a 
respectful way. And I have to really give them a round of applause for the way they did 
that.  
 
[applause] 
 
And also, to everybody who asked a question, including the questions we didn't take -- it 
takes a lot of guts to get up in front of an audience and ask questions. Some of them 
were terrific and the other ones were just darn interesting.  
 
[laughter] 
 
And I think it might sell some more books for Eben Alexander, but to everybody who got 
up and asked a question, thanks very much for doing it. 
 
 [applause]  
 
I -- we would love to have you Tweet about the debate.  
 
20:28:16 
 
As I said at the beginning, our hashtag tonight is #afterdeath. That -- our Twitter handle 
is @IQ2US. And this was our final debate of our spring season. We -- this was Debate 
#91, I think, that we've put on since Bob Rosenkranz started this thing. And it was a new 
zig-zag for us. I think it went really well. It was very interesting. A little metaphysical for 
a night out in New York. I mean, if this is anybody's first date, you're probably --  
 
[laughter] 
 
-- it's probably going to stick for a while. We're doing a debate, though -- the National 
Constitutional Center -- Constitution Center in Philadelphia next month, our second time 
going there. And we're going to be looking at the question of whether independent 
political speech is the linchpin of our democracy, or is it its Achilles heel? We're looking 
at the question of the ability of individuals and organizations to influence campaigns 
through campaign spending and whether the Constitution actually presents that 
expenditure as a matter of the First Amendment.  Tickets to that will be available 
through our website, wwwiq2us.org.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 53 -

And we are going to be announcing our fall lineup soon.  We'll be back here at the 
Kaufman Center, and the debates for that are in tonight's program.  On the list of topics 
that we're considering, "Income inequality," "Assisted suicide," "Genetically modified 
food," "Cybersecurity," "Privacy," "Monogamy," "Climate engineering," "The private 
lives of public figures," and "Google Glass." 
 
[laughter] 
 
So those of you who can't join the debate, of course we are on fora.tv and on NPR 
stations across the nation.  Okay.  So I have the results all in.  Remember, we had you 
vote twice on this motion, "Death is not final," once before the debate and once again 
after the debate, and the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared 
our winner.  Here are the results.  In the first vote, "Death is not final," 37 percent 
agreed with that, 31 percent disagreed with that, 32 percent were undecided. 
[cheering] 
Those are the first results. 
 
20:30:11 
 
Now, the second vote -- remember, the team whose numbers have changed the most 
will be the winner -- in the second vote, the team arguing for the motion, their second 
vote was 42 percent.  They went from 37 percent to 42 percent.  They picked up 5 
percentage points.  The team against the motion, now -- 5 percentage points is the 
number to beat -- the team against the motion -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- they went -- their first vote was 31 percent, their second vote was 46 percent.  That's 
up 15 percent.  The team arguing against the motion "Death is not final," has won this 
debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
Basically saying, "Death is final," sorry.  Thanks very much, everyone.  Thank you from 
me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared.  We'll see you next time. 
 
[applause]
