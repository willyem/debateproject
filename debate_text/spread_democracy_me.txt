ROBERT SIEGEL  

I’d like to introduce at this point, uh, the person who, who really, 

uh…makes these, these debates possible.  And that’s Robert 

Rosenkranz who’s chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation, 

sponsor of the evening’s debate.  And Bob is gonna make some 

opening remarks.  And I’m hearing some—  [APPLAUSE]    

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Well, thank—thank you, Robert, very much, …with me tonight is 

Dana Wolfe, our executive producer, and I’d like to just extend a 

very warm welcome to all of you, at this, the opening debate of 

our second series.   Intelligence Squared was formed with the 

goal of raising the level of public discourse in America.  The 

concept is to frame a provocative proposition on a hot-button 

topic.   The panel of experts attempts to convince us to vote, 

either for or against the proposition.  The audience votes before 

hearing the debate, participates during a question period and 

then decides who has carried the day with their final vote.   The 

response to this format has been really wonderful.  Every one of 

our debates has sold out.  Uh, we’re produced for radio by WNYC

and carried on, uh, 70 National  Public Radio stations around the 

country.  And tonight’s proceedings, uh, will be aired on public 

television as well, on Channel 13 WNET here in—in New York.   

Well, American foreign policy has often been energized by a sense 

of moral conviction.  Most of us have a strong conviction in the 

merits of the system that includes freedom of speech, free 

exercise of religion, rule of law, respect for property rights, and an 

elaborate balancing of power between the, uh, various branches 

of government.   Uh…this is perhaps, uh, are the elements of 

what Fareed Zakaria has called liberal democracy.  And they may 

be the elements we have in mind when we seek to encourage 

democracy in other nations.   But our founders were as fearful of 

the tyranny of the mob as they were of the tyranny of the king.  

They constructed a Constitution that requires far more than a 

simple majority at a single moment in time to subvert these 

liberal elements.  When democracy means simply the use of a 

ballot box to choose a leader, the merits become far more 

problematic.  And that’s the subject of tonight’s debate.  Should 

the US encourage democracy in countries where the best-

organized and most politically powerful groups are Islamic 

radicals?  How should we react to an elected Hamas?  What do 

we make of polls that show that 65% of Middle Easterners do not 

believe that spreading democracy is a real US objective?   On the 

other hand, if the US does not encourage democratic ideas, are

we merely cynical supporters of despotic regimes and narrow 

elites?  Do we ignore the large, uh, majority of Muslims that 

believe that democracy will work in their countries?   Can such 

an approach galvanize, uh, domestic support.  And if not, can we 

prudently, uh, take a hands-off approach to a region of the world 

that is so— of such enormous geopolitical significance.  Well 

these are vexing questions indeed and present a real conundrum 

for US policy.  But fortunately we have a distinguished panel of 

experts to turn to this evening.  Our moderator, Robert Siegel, is 

the senior host of National Public Radio’s award-winning program 

“All Things Considered,” and is the radio host of the Intelligence 

Squared series.  He got started in radio broadcasting when he 

was a college freshman, in 1964, and he’s still at it.   He’s 

reported from Europe, the Middle East, and across the US, and 

for four years, directed NPR’s news and information department.  

Welcome back, Robert.  [APPLAUSE]    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

I’d like to welcome you to this, the first debate of the second 

series of the Intelligence Squared US debates, tonight’s motion is, 

“Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea.”  I’m 

gonna give you a brief rundown of what will happen this evening, 

first, the proposer of the motion will start by presenting that side 

of the argument, and the opposition will follow, and each person 

will get a maximum of eight minutes and we’ll go back and forth,

from one side to the other.   Second, when all six speakers are 

finished with their opening remarks, I’ll open up the floor to brief 

questions from the audience.  Third, when the question-and-

answer is complete, each debater will make a final statement, no 

more than two minutes per person.   Fourth, after the final 

closing statement is made, you will vote on tonight’s motion with 

the keypad that’s attached to the arm-rest of your seat.  And fifth 

and last, I will announce the results of the audience vote, and I’ll 

tell you which side carried the day.   Now, before hearing from 

our panelists, I’d like to start with a pre-debate vote.  And I’d like 

you to pick up the keypad that’s attached to the, uh, arm-rest on 

your left.  For audience members who are sitting on the aisle to 

my right, uh, your keypad is attached to the arm-rest on your 

right side next to your neighbor’s.   And when I tell you, after my 

prompt, you will press “1,” to vote for the motion, “2” to vote 

against the motion, and “3” if you’re undecided, I’m gonna repeat 

the—the motion, which is that “Spreading democracy in the 

Middle East is a bad idea.”  “1” is for, “2” is against, “3” is 

undecided, and you may begin voting now.

Let’s start a debate.  Flynt Leverett.    

FLYNT LEVERETT 

Good evening.  It’s a pleasure to kick off tonight’s debate.  I’m 

gonna start by telling you a couple of things that my colleagues 

and I are not arguing, in our support for tonight’s resolution.   

First, in arguing that spreading democracy in the Middle East is a 

bad idea, my colleagues and I are not arguing that the people of 

the Middle East—whether defined as Arabs, Muslims, or in any 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

                                                   “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea” (9/18/07) Page 6. 

 

 

 

other way—are inherently less capable of democratic 

development than any other ethnic, cultural or religious group.   

Second, we do not question the desirability of democracy, or the 

benefits of living under a democratic political order.  I have the 

good fortune of being an American citizen solely through the 

accident of my birth.   But my two colleagues tonight, came to 

this country from elsewhere, and embraced American citizenship 

by choice, precisely because they are convinced of democracy’s 

desirability.  In arguing that spreading democracy in the Middle 

East is a bad idea, my colleagues and I want to look at tonight’s 

resolution through the prism of American national interests.  Of 

course US interests in the Middle East are complex and 

multifaceted, but I’m gonna boil down our most important 

interests in this critical region to three things.  First, the free flow 

of oil from the Persian Gulf, second, the security and welfare of 

the state of Israel, and third, keeping the Middle East from 

providing a platform for further mass-casualty terrorist attacks of 

the sort that we suffered on 9-11.  I will argue for tonight’s 

resolution because I believe that promoting democracy in the 

Middle East is not just not helpful for these interests, it is 

downright harmful to them.   Let’s look first at terrorism.  

President Bush and his administration’s defenders have argued 

since the United States began preparing to invade Iraq, that 

spreading democracy in the Middle East is the essential antidote 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

                                                   “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea” (9/18/07) Page 7. 

 

 

 

to jihadist terrorism originating in the region.   But there is 

literally not a shred of hard evidence supporting that proposition.  

From Osama bin Laden on down, that claim that jihadist 

terrorists are products of economic and political marginalization 

is simply false.  The 9-11 hijackers were truly trust-fund 

terrorists, from economically and politically advantaged 

backgrounds.  Proponents of democracy promotion in the Middle 

East also argue, that democratization is needed to counteract the 

distorting effects of madrasa educations on the mind-set of 

millions of young Arabs and Muslims in the region.  But the fact 

is that Al Qaeda and other internationally active terrorist groups, 

don’t recruit from madrasas.   Look at it in practical terms.  To be 

an internationally active jihadist terrorist, you need, for example, 

English language skills, you need a certain level of technical 

competence.  Madrasas are not the place where one acquires that 

kind of skill-set.  That’s why Al Qaeda and other internationally 

active jihadist terrorist groups recruit primarily among university 

students and university graduates.  Indeed if you look at the 

backgrounds of terrorists who have been recruited over the years 

by Al Qaeda, you find the number-one subject that they studied 

at university was engineering, the number-two subject was 

medicine.   Democracy promotion is not going to win the war on 

terror, in fact the Bush administration has tacitly acknowledged 

that promoting democracy is not winning the war on terror.  Since

                                                   “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea” (9/18/07) Page 8. 

 

 

 

2005, in the annual Patterns of Global Terrorism report, the 

administration has, as a matter of policy, withheld publishing the 

aggregate statistics showing the number of significant terrorist 

incidents around the world each year.   They withhold that 

information, I would suggest, not because the data show that the 

number of incidents is getting less.  It is actually getting greater--

democracy promotion will not help us win the war on terror.   

Now let’s turn to Israel’s place in the region.  Proponents of 

democratization in the Middle East often advance what I call the 

garbage-collection model of lowering Palestinian and Arab 

expectations.  This model assumes that Palestinians and their 

sympathizers in the Arab and Muslim worlds don’t really care 

that much about Palestinians living under occupation, that 

Palestinian and other Arab leaders use Israel as a convenient way 

to deflect popular attention from their own performance.   I 

myself heard President Bush argue in the White House Situation 

Room, that a democratically-elected Palestinian government 

would be more focused on collecting garbage, and less, quote-

unquote, “hung up” on territory and the status of Jerusalem.  

Well, we tested this theory in the 2006 Palestinian elections, and 

the result was Hamas’s victory in internationally supervised 

balloting in the West Bank and Gaza.  The hard reality is that 

negotiating peace between Arab states and Israel is not popular 

in the Middle East.  Arab-Israel peacemaking requires that Arab

states—that, that the United States work with indigenous 

regimes in Arab states that are prepared to pursue peace with 

Israel,  not because it is popular, but because those leaders judge 

it to be in their countries’ national interests.  This is the 

approach that was pursued by Anwar Sadat in the Camp David 

accords.  Sadat paid the ultimate price for that initiative.   But it 

is the model that has been followed by his successor, President 

Mubarek, by King Hussein and his successor King Abdullah in 

Jordan.  It is the model that is being followed today by Saudi 

King Abdullah in the Arab League Peace Initiative.  Promoting 

democracy in the Middle East will not enhance the prospects for 

Arab-Israel peacemaking, it will in fact, harm prospects for peace.  

The same argument can also be extended to eliciting the 

absolutely essential cooperation of regional regimes, to enable the 

United States to play its critical role as the guarantor of physical 

security for Persian Gulf oil fields.   The legacy of 20th century 

colonialism in the Middle East, oil concessions, and all the rest, 

mean that it is not popular for regional regimes to cooperate with 

hegemonic power.  While there is no evidence that democracy 

reduces the incidence of terrorism, there is ample evidence—from 

places like Egypt and Saudi Arabia—that holding more open 

elections in these and other societies would produce governments 

that are more anti-American than incumbent regimes.   Given 

this reality, how is it in America’s interest to rush these

countries’ populations into voting booths?  A couple of final 

points.  Advocate of democracy promotion in the Middle East, 

oftentimes argue that—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

One.   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

—by promoting democracy, we are also promoting the spread of 

liberal values, the emancipation of women, um…and other things 

that Americans hold right and dear.  And…they often suggest 

that, if we are not engaged in promoting this kind of agenda, we 

really are—to use Mr. Rosenkranz’s phrase—cynical supporters 

of despotic regimes.  But, if you look at popular attitudes in the 

Arab and Muslim world, these attitudes are not just increasingly 

anti-American in their orientation toward international issues.   

They are less reformist on internal issues than many incumbent 

regimes.  The best hope for modernization and ultimately 

liberalization, in the Arab and Muslim worlds today, lies in 

incumbent regimes who recognize that, first of all—   

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Thank you—

—economic modernization is essential to their country’s future.

Uh…[APPLAUSE]  Danielle Pletka, against the motion.   

DANIELLE PLETKA  

Good evening, everybody.  You saw me looking around in a little 

bit of a panic and that’s because I realized I left my glasses in the 

other room.  So I’m just going to hold this a little bit further 

forward, if you’ll forgive me.  Before anything else, let us all agree 

that democracy is a good, in and of itself.  It doesn’t require a wit 

as sharp as Winston Churchill’s to know that, stacked up against 

dictatorship, mob rule or even benevolent tyranny, democracy – 

notwithstanding all of its imperfections, is the best system of 

government.   

 

Let’s also accept that democracy means a great deal more than 

elections and that when we say democracy we’re really using a 

shorthand for a system that contemplates representative 

leadership, rule of law, economic as well as political freedoms 

and more.  Finally, let’s stipulate that while we expect our news 

to arrive instantaneously, our paychecks to be deposited 

immediately and our diets to work miraculously, democracy is 

indeed a long term project.  I’m pleased to see that Flynt, 

Shibley…Shibley, uh, Dimitri, uh, have accepted the idea that the 

system of government most admired in the Middle East is 

democratic and that they agree that people do indeed aspire to 

freedom in that region.  And I must say I agree with the caveat 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

                                                   “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea” (9/18/07) Page 12. 

 

 

 

that people do not aspire to freedom that is eclipsed by fear for 

the future and for their own security and well being.  So we have 

a moral good that we are all agreed upon in the abstract.  What 

we don’t agree about is the strategic imperative or the 

appropriate role of the United States.    

 

We can debate about that a little bit later but the foundation of 

that debate should be a proper understanding of the nexus 

between tyranny and terrorism.  How do groups like Al Qaeda 

operate?  It should be clear by now that in parasitic fashion these 

groups feed off of host nations that are weak.  They operate with 

a key, with a core group who are committed ideologues and do 

come from all walks of life.  But the real sustenance, but that is, 

that is only part of the story.  The real sustenance for Al Qaeda 

and other light groups is an environment that tolerates their 

methods in appreciation of their supposed ideals.  For many it is 

not necessarily the virgins that await or the triumphs of the 

return of the Caliphate.  Rather, it is the relief from the life in 

purgatory that constitutes the average lot of the average Arab.  

That life is about unemployment, real rates of up to thirty-five 

and forty per cent – and young men, who when polled 

consistently complain that their existence offers no hope and no 

opportunity.   

 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

It is about the fact that the United Nations development program 

estimates that nine per cent of every business deal in the Middle 

East goes for bribes and when students who want to vote step 

into the streets of Cairo they risk arrest and torture, like Karim 

Suleiman [PH], who was sodomized and tortured because he 

demonstrated in favor of the rule of law.  These victims of Middle 

Eastern oppression are the ones who provide the oxygen that 

enables Al Qaeda to operate and it gives resonance to their 

political messages.  And why?  If your life and your father’s life 

and your son’s life is lived under the yoke between this or 

dictator for life that, you cannot form a new political organization 

and you cannot change your system of government and you 

cannot begin to help yourself and you look for other options.  

 

And if the only haven in which you can talk about those options 

is in the mosque and the only thing the mosque is offering up is 

Islamic purity, a return to greatness and the uncorrupted life of 

the true believer, it shouldn’t be a great wonder that such ideas 

take hold.  If you find that argument unpersuasive let’s for a 

moment look from our opponent’s viewpoint.  They rightly 

suggest that in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, 

Kuwait, Palestine – I could go on – the main opposition parties 

are Islamist.  But why?  It’s because they have a proven record of 

delivering on a better life?  Is it because somehow they have more

charisma than other opponents of the regime?  Or is the fact that 

the Islamists have successfully used the vast religious networks 

and cash available to them to promote their own political cause – 

occupying the only political space that exists in the authoritarian 

Arab world.   

 

There are only two places for breathing room in the current 

Middle Eastern political construct -- the dictator space and the 

Islamists.  Oppression gives the Islamists the popularity to move 

their agenda and further the environment in which Al Qaeda is 

tolerated and worse.  And they know it.   In extensive writings, 

including by Bin Laden and Zarqawi--  and here I really disagree 

with what Flynt had to say – they rail against democracy because 

they know it represents a threat to their lifeline.  Zarqawi wrote to 

Ayman al-Zawahiri bemoaning the future of their fight in Iraq.  

Democracy is coming, he wrote, and there will be no excuse 

thereafter.  So what is the answer?  The answer cannot be that 

because Hamas and others take advantage of the democratic 

process, therefore, democracy is discredited.   We must confront 

systems that tolerate Islamists and provide ideological safe haven 

to Al Qaeda.   

 

And the way to do that is by insuring that there are other 

opposition parties, genuine reformers, who have the power and 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

the money to make their voices heard.  Our opponents will argue 

that the United States has no role to play, that where we interfere 

we make things worse and that with our inconsistency we risk 

destabilizing the region.  That is an unacceptable formulation.  It 

is certainly true that the United States is not a fault free advocate 

for democracy.  I can now agree that there are times when the 

reality of foreign policy demands that we do business with 

objectionable leaders.  But there is no reason to rely on the 

brutality of dictators because that brutality at the end only 

besmirches us.  Worse still, there is clear evidence that Jihadists 

flourish where dictators rule.  In supporting the PLO, what did we 

do to rid Gaza and the West Bank of Hamas in supporting 

Mubarak?   

 

What have we done to rid Egypt of the Muslim Brotherhood?  

Sixty years of rooting for the dictator’s stability, as my colleague 

Liz Cheney will make clear, didn’t protect us on 9/11.  Our role 

must be to facilitate and educate, to hold open the door for 

democrats like Ayman Nour in Egypt.  It should be to use our 

influence to see laws rescinded to stop the formation of new 

parties and constrain the grass roots activities of political and 

economic reformers.   It should be to insure that mosques are not 

the only place where political parties and reformers can meet and 

it should be to insure that economic reforms go hand in hand

with political change.  Ultimately, when young men can expect 

unemployment in a thriving market economy, there will still be a 

few who are attracted to Al Qaeda – those medical students and 

those engineers.  But the vast mass will not.  They will be less 

attracted to the answers they hear from radical preachers.   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

One.    

DANIELLE PLETKA   

Or do our opponents here this evening really believe that reform 

is not possible, that reformers do not exist?  No one among us 

has suggested the only way to prize open the closed doors of the 

Middle Eastern palaces is with Middle Eastern…is with Middle 

East – excuse me – military force.  To the contrary – if that is our 

system it will fail.  The same holds true for Al Qaeda.  We cannot 

kill every Pakistani that tolerates an Al Qaeda operative in his 

midst.  We cannot bomb houses of worship that preach Islamic 

politics and jihad.  We can throw our considerable weight behind 

the people who do believe that rule of democracy – not jihad and 

bin Laden – offer real hope for the future.  We may never do it 

perfectly but that is certainly not a reason not to do it at all.

SHIBLEY TELHAMI 

Good evening.  I think, uh, America should stand up for 

democracy and freedom.  I think it should be an inspiring model, 

as it has been historically.  What we shouldn't be doing is trying 

to pretend like we’re capable of making spreading democracy a 

top priority in a world in which we face many threats – and 

certainly not to do it by force.  I think, if you look at what has 

happened over the past five years as a consequence of this policy 

of spreading democracy by force, is that we have a public and 

Arab world that doesn’t believe us:  we have a gov…governments 

that don’t believe us:  we have less democracy, more anarchy, 

more instability, more terrorism – and even worse, the growing 

American dependence on the very institutions and the very…very 

governments that need to be reformed.   

 

In essence, we have given democracy a bad name.  It is hard for 

people in the region, including people who badly and desperately 

are looking for democracy and freedom, to think of democracy 

and freedom the American way without thinking about the 

horrors of Iraq.  We have paid a price by diverting attention from 

the important issue of human rights, which we often confuse with 

spreading democratic systems.  That issue which we should 

trump and advocate has paid a price as a consequence of this 

policy.  Let me begin with some of the facts.  The vast majority of

people in the Arab world, all polls show, do not believe that we 

mean to spread democracy in the Middle East.  Most of them 

believe that we’re in Iraq and in the region for oil, Israel and 

weakening the Muslim world.  Even the governments who have 

faced pressures from us – and yes, they have faced pressures 

and, yes, they have been told to liberalize – all have believed that 

this is essentially tactical, that this is done in order to coerce 

them to cooperate on strategic issue or as a political domestic 

issue to divert attention from the absence of wea…uh, the 

weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.    

 

And as a consequence, they dealt with it tactically.  They said, 

The President needs a little political – give him a little election so 

he can say, I’ve got more democracy in Libya, I’ve got more 

democracy in, in Saudi Arabia.  And then once he claims that he 

has a success -- he’s not gonna claim it as a failure the next day -

-  and then you can go on with business.  And look at the reality 

that we have at the moment.  The vast majority of people in the 

Middle East – when you poll them – those people whom we’re 

supposed to be giving democracy to --  uh, the vast majority 

believe that the Middle East is less democratic today than it was 

before the Iraq War – less dramatic today than it was before Iraq 

War.

And it was horribly undemocratic before the Iraq War, no doubt.  

And how is that the case?  Is this simply made up by the media?  

Is this what people tell them?  Is this what leaders tell them?  I’m 

afraid there’s a little bit of reality to that and we now see it in 

many of the places that we celebrated early on as examples of 

democracy.  Remember, the three big examples – Iraq, [NOISE 

ON MIC]  Lebanon and the Palestinian areas --  and you look at 

where we are in these areas.  But separate from that there was 

some other dynamic that goes on that we are not coming to grips 

with – something that our policy does because in, in reality we 

are not making democracy our priority.  And we, in essence, 

deceive ourselves when we think we are.  Let me give you an 

example.  Ninety per cent of the Arab public passionately 

opposed the Iraq War, didn’t want to see it take place.  They told 

the governments, Don’t do it.  It’s gonna bring about ruins.   

 

Their government’s instinct was, Don’t support the Iraq War.  But 

when we went to the Iraq War -- these governments are certainly 

dependent on the U.S. --  in the end they came along and they 

provided logistical support and bases and everything else.  And 

they were telling us that they’re worried about their public 

opinion.  Well, we had, it was more important for us that they 

support our policies on terrorism, on Iraq, on the Arab/Israeli 

issue, despite the anger of the people, than the liberalization.

What happens in the process?  How is the Jordanian government 

or the Egyptian government or the Saudi government going to 

face up with that pressure that comes from the public at a time of 

war?  What they do is they unleash security services.  Yes, they 

have elections  -- and by the way, some of those elections we’ve 

had as little as twenty per cent and possibly only ten per cent of 

the public participating.  It tells you how people, how seriously 

people took it.   

 

But in the end these governments became more repressive in 

order to quell, to, to, to put down any possible opposition, given 

the anger of the public.  And this is essentially what we do, even 

in the war on terrorism.  Who do we think our most important 

allies in these, uh, countries --   It’s not the Democrats.  Yes, the 

Democrats we theoretically want to empower them.  But who do 

we give most aid to?  With whom do we institutionally cooperate – 

the security services who are embedded with our security 

services, the military, which are in bed with our military?  These 

are the institutions of the repressions that need to be reformed.  

But those are the ones we have to deal with.  And I’m not saying 

we don’t need to deal with them.  We have to deal with them.  But 

the reality of it is that the consequence is perpetuating 

repression, increasing it even as we pretend to be promoting it.  

Let me, just a couple of, make a couple of points to end.  One is

that I believe that all people in the world and all Arabs and all 

Muslims want to see freedom and democracy.   

 

No one likes dictatorship.  And yes, you, I don’t think they want a 

different kind of democracy and freedom.  When I ask them, uh, 

Name two countries where there’s most freedom and democracy 

for their people they name primarily Western countries – Western 

Europeans and the U.S.  They know what democracy and 

freedom are.  People aspire to it.  But one thing they don’t want is 

they don’t want anarchy.  They want anarchy even less than they 

democracy.  And they want to see no occupation.  They want 

freedom but they want to avoid anarchy and they want to avoid 

occupation.  And when they see what is going on in Iraq, if a 

leader in Egypt looks at their citizen and say, Do you want Cairo 

or do you want Baghdad?  I want Cairo over Baghdad any day of 

the week, with all the pain that people face every day. And that is 

the reality of how the choices are seen in the region.  Let me end 

by saying I am not in harmony with the view that we –

…shouldn’t advocate democracy.  I think we need to advocate 

democracy.  But I believe that there is a better way.  I think we 

should focus on those issues over which there is international

consensus, like human rights.  We should hold people 

responsible to treaties that they have signed and in order for us 

to be powerful in that regard we have to uphold our end of the 

bargain.  We have to be an inspiring model, not just lecture to 

people while we have the Abu Ghraib prison.  And we need to 

work in economic reform because that is the structure that 

enables true democracy to emerge from within.  We’re treating 

Arab as a passive people that, that need to be told from the 

outside.  No, they need empowerment from the outside – not 

manipulation.  Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]

 [OVERLAP]  Thank you, Shibley Telhami, uh, speaking for the

LIZ CHENEY 

Uh, there are clearly a number of issues that our opponents 

would like to debate tonight.  And I, too, would welcome those 

debates.  I would readily accept a debate on the topic, "Was it 

Right for America to Go to War in Iraq?"  I would readily accept a 

debate on the topic, "Is America Effectively Promoting Democracy 

in the Middle East?"  Or perhaps one on, "How Accurate Are 

Opinion Polls in the Middle East?"  And I hope Intelligence 

Squared invites me back if they’re gonna have those debates.  

But those are not the issues before us tonight.  Although I can 

understand why our opponents would rather discuss those

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

issues than have to stand before you and argue against 

democracy.   

 

But make no mistake, their protestations aside, that is what 

they’re doing.  The truth is that spreading democracy in the 

Middle East is not a bad idea nor is it a failed idea.  Nor is it an 

idea that would have been good except that George W. Bush 

adopted it.  [AUDIENCE RESPONSE]  It is, by any objective 

measure, a good idea, the right idea and a necessary policy 

choice for America today.  Here are some facts:  America is at war 

with an enemy driven by radical, ideological hatred to destroy us 

and all that we stand for.  These terrorists were not created by 

U.S. policy.  They are religious zealots who will stop at nothing in 

achieving their objective of establishing a global Caliphate in 

which individual lives have no value, women are chattel and the 

only legitimate faith is a perverted version of Islam.   

 

To accomplish their objectives, the terrorists or the trust fund 

terrorists – as my colleague Flynt has called them --  need 

recruits.  Because the truth about the trust fund terrorists is 

they don’t do the dirty work themselves.  They’ve got to find 

young men and women willing to strap bombs onto their bodies, 

detonate them, killing themselves and taking as many innocents 

with them as possible.  For decades the terrorists have known

that they can prey most effectively in societies where young 

people live in despair, where they have no hope for a better future 

here on earth – in societies that are characterized by brittle, 

autocratic regimes and closed status economic systems.  For too 

many years America perpetuated this status quo.  We supported 

those authoritarian regimes, we ignored the aspirations of their 

people.  This policy, essentially the one that our opponents would 

have us return to tonight, brought only a false sense of security 

and stability.   

 

It is true that young people in the Arab world, as elsewhere, 

yearn for the freedom to be heard.  They yearn to stand for 

something larger than self.  They yearn to control their own 

destinies and choose their own leaders – and only democracy can 

fulfill those aspirations.  Our opponents argue there is no 

evidence that democracy combats terror.  To make this 

argument, you have to ignore the words of the terrorists 

themselves.  If you read the captured letters of former Al Qaeda 

and Iraq Chief, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi -- who my colleague Dani 

Pletka quoted – you will see, in 2005 he wrote, quote:  We have 

declared a bitter war against the principle of democracy and all 

those who seek to embrace it.  The terrorists have done this 

because they know the fundamental truth – that people never 

choose to ru…be ruled by Al Qaeda or the Taliban.  Those are the

ideologies that must be imposed by force.  Our opponents tonight 

also argue that supporting democracy is messy and that elections 

do not always turn out the way we would like them to.   

 

That is certainly true here in America, as well.  But that is 

essentially an argument about how to effectively promote 

democracy, not one about whether promoting democracy is a bad 

idea.  So let’s dispense with some straw men and agree on several 

things.  Promoting democracy is not only about supporting 

elections.  Elections are necessary but not sufficient and often 

they should come last in the reform process, not first.  America’s 

democracy policy should and does include supporting freedom of 

speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, women’s rights 

and a thriving civil society.  Asserting, as our opponents do, that 

somehow promoting democracy in the Middle East is an imperial 

imposition of American values requires ignoring two critical facts.  

The first is you have to ignore that the desire for freedom is a 

universal human desire.   

 

At its base this is an assertion, regardless of what they say, that 

only some people – maybe those of us fortunate enough to be 

born in the West – really desire human freedom.  At least fifty per 

cent of our panel tonight is living evidence that that claim is not 

defensible. Our opponents’ position also requires ignoring the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

                                                   “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea” (9/18/07) Page 26. 

 

 

 

massive change underway in the Middle East today.  Five or six 

years ago state dominated media, state press dominated the 

media in the region.  Today there’s been an explosion of 

independent newspapers, television programming and access to 

the internet.  Six years ago no woman had ever run for or voted 

in an election in the Gulf.  Today they’ve done both.  Six years 

ago a demo…and discussion about democracy in the Arab world 

would have brought ridicule and potentially jail time.   

 

Today leaders, reformers, journalists and millions of others are 

engaged in a constant ongoing debate and discussion about 

democracy.  And America’s actions in this regard matter.  As an 

Egyptian reformer said recently, When the outside world softens 

its call for reform regimes are emboldened to ignore their citizens’ 

rights.  Knowing that we are on the side of those fighting for 

freedom empowers them and it strengthens them.  Abandoning 

them or this cause would be unjust and unwise.  In that regard, 

our opponents tonight need to answer this question:  If you are 

truly concerned about America’s credibility and image in the 

Middle East, why are you willing to accept the grave damage that 

will be done to that credibility if America adopts your approach, if 

we return to the policy of support for autocrats and turn our 

backs on the aspirations of the, uh, Arab people?

Finally, consider this:  As we engage in this debate here tonight 

in Manhattan, a Saudi woman can sit in her home sixty-five 

miles, fifty-five hundred miles away.  She can blog about her life, 

her fears, her oppression, her hopes and her aspirations.  She 

can post that on the internet for all the world to read.  She has a 

voice, probably for the first time in her life.  If we were to tune in 

right now to any of the scores of Arabic satellite channels we 

would find young men and women from across the region 

debating the issues of the day, arguing and questioning 

authority.  Adopting the path proposed by our opponents would 

be to betray those young men and women.  Would our opponents 

have us tell young Arab men and women that America doesn’t 

believe they’re ready for democracy?  Would they have us say to 

women across the Gulf that although they have been able, over 

the last few years, to vote and run –  

ROBERT SIEGEL 

[OVERLAP]  One.

..for office, that was just temporary and America has now decided 

we won’t support their efforts any longer.  Would they have us 

assert that we, in our ultimate wisdom, have decided that instead 

of supporting freedom fighters, we will throw America’s great and 

unparalleled strength behind autocrats and against the people?  

That surely is a world in which the terrorists have won.  That is a

DIMITRI SIMES 

This was an interesting presentation.  I never knew that I 

believed in all those things.  But it’s always, you know, a learning 

experience, uh, particularly when you debate Bush 

Administration officials or many former administration officials.  

Your kind of plan, what you mean, what you sought and what 

you said.  I don’t think that this was our position and I hope that 

you will make your own judgment, whether the previous 

presentation really reflected our side's.  How can one be against 

democracy promotion?  A very prominent American leader once 

said, It is our destiny to promote democracy worldwide because 

we cannot yield moral ground to repressive regimes because it 

would be unjust and wrong and because, also, it could be never 

secure as long as there are repressive regimes.  Because they 

would not leave us alone and would continue to plot against us.  

Sorry, France, it was not a prominent American.  It was Leon 

Trotsky.  [LAUGHTER]  And of course, he spoke not about 

promoting democracy but promoting proletarian revolutions.  But

he believed in proletarian revolutions very strongly.    

 

He was a sincere man.  So were many Crusaders when they 

invaded the Middle East and you remember what has happened 

and what did it cost – to the Arabs, to the Christians, to the 

regions.  Uh, we are not talking about our private beliefs.  We are 

entitled to our beliefs.  But democracy is not a religion.  

Democracy promotion should be policy.  Therefore I will not 

hesitate to say that there are some things that are more 

important than democracy.  If, uh, and then in 1930s, we knew 

what Hitler would do to the Jews and to the others, would we 

allow him to come to power democratically?  Wouldn’t we 

consider stopping him a wise and honorable policy?  And I 

completely agree with the Israelis now when they would not want 

to recognize democratically elected Hamas.  And I do not care 

how many votes Hezbollah gets, but as long as they do what they 

do we should judge them not by the process to which they came 

to power, but what they’re doing to themselves, to others and 

what they present to the United States.   

 

I would yield to no one in my commitment to freedom.  Freedom -

-  to select democracy for us and to freedom to allow others to 

make their own choices.  I am touched by anecdotes about Arab 

women.  I don’t need anecdotes when I hear about two and a half

million Iraqi refugees – two and a half million, for whom in the 

name of democracy promotion we are doing almost exactly 

nothing.  And more than a hundred thousand civilians who have 

died so far in Iraq and more dying.  And our democracy 

promo…promoters don’t seem to be extremely concerned.  There 

was a very prominent American who said, in 1964, that 

extremism in defense of freedom is no vice.   His name was Barry 

Goldwater.  I disagree.  Extremism in the name of whatever is 

never a virtue.  And extremism is never a sound policy.    

 

First about democracy as something that stop…stops wars – 

remember, the Peloponnesian War among the Greeks.  More than 

twenty-five hundred centuries ago and there were democracies on 

both sides.  Now, I just came from Washington.  Who, uh, do you 

think burned Washington in 1812?   My impression is that this 

was the British.  And of course, they had a monarchy but they 

were very democratic by standards of the time.  Now, more 

Americans have died in the Civil War than in any other war in 

American history.  Would you disagree that the Confederacy was 

democratic – at least by the standard of the time?  And what 

about the British in South Africa, fighting each other at the end 

of the 19th Century.  Democracies do go to war against each 

other.  Now, about democracy and terrorism – well, you know, I 

think that one of the most democratic countries I know is called

Britain.   

 

And you see British born citizens engaging in the most vicious 

terror against their country.  Well, you would say, but this may 

be terror imported.  Well, about, what about the Basques in 

Spain?  What about IRA and their long war against Britain?  

What about the Oklahoma City bomber?   Come on, we know 

very well that there are many causes of terror.  And to say that 

the absence of democracy in Saudi Arabia and Egypt really is 

responsible for September 11th -- you know, a claim like that has 

no scientific evidence whatsoever, is not based on interviews with 

the terrorists themselves.  No senior CIA official who knows how 

these suspects were interviewed and what they said would ever 

claim that these people have attacked the United States because 

their Arab regimes were not democratic.  People love freedom, I 

completely agree with that.  But, you know, when people love 

freedom they may not only that they would be able to vote or 

even to enjoy free press or even, uh, freedom of religion or even 

that they would be able to travel.   

 

You know what they also mean?  They mean that they want to be 

able to make their own choices, including to make their own 

mistakes.  And that’s what the American Revolution was all 

about.  And when the only remaining super power is coming to

India is very strongly against democracy promotion.   We should 

believe in democracy for ourselves, we should promote freedom of

punishment cells were very small.   But because…the food is 

rationed.  And clothes come in one size.  So for tall people, they’re 

always hungry, and clothes simply doesn’t cover their body, and 

protect them from cold.  But for people of my size, it was easier 

with hunger, and I always had an extra cloth, to cover myself, 

from the cold.   And the winters are very cold in gulag.  There we 

were praying for global warming.  [LAUGHTER]  So…one can 

think that…living under totalitarian regime was a big 

disadvantage.  Of course I’m very happy that my daughters were 

born in freedom.  But, sometimes I really think, that having 

experience of living in a fear society, I have a big advantage.   

Because, I will never take freedom for granted.  I will never think 

that the grass on the other side could be greener.  I will never say 

what was said by one human rights, so-called human rights 

officer of the United Nations two years ago in Baghdad, when he 

was explaining why under Saddam Hussein it was better.   He 

said, you know, under Saddam, if only you object, give away your 

freedom of thought and expression, you’re physically more or less 

okay.  Now only the one who never had to give away his freedom 

of thought and expression can say such a thing.   People who live 

in fear societies, have different perspective, of the advantages of 

democracy.  And when they say democracy, exactly as all the 

colleagues who are against said, democracy’s not about elections.

only had elections but as just now was said, he has opposition.  

He was elected democratically, but nobody would think that 

Third Reich is…a democracy.  America’s strong democracy 

because, it has all these institutions of civil society, free press, 

independent courts, and so forth.   Because…when I—when I’m 

speaking about democracy …the society which as I call, can pass 

the town square test--you can come to the center of your city.  

You can speak your mind, you can express your opinions, and 

you won’t be punished, you will not be harassed.   That’s free 

society.  So, is promoting free institutions of free society, like, free 

press, or, or independent opposition, independent courts, is 

promotion of these institutions result us a better year?  Of course 

not.   What, that’s, exactly what America was doing, when you 

defeated Germany, and Japan in the Second World War.  You 

spent enormous efforts, economical, intellectual, financial, to 

support, to promote democracy, and today Japan and Germany 

is not a threat.   Take Russia, when Russia was part of the 

totalitarian Soviet system, it was your worst enemy.  When Soviet 

Union fell apart and Russia went towards freedom, it almost 

became your ally.  Today, when freedom is then in retreat, in a 

big retreat, it becomes again a threat to America.   And that is 

true about every part of the world.  Take Venezuela, you take 

North Korea, you take Iran…what—whenever there is a threat to 

America is means that democracy is there, in retreat.  If Middle

East today is a dangerous place, it’s not because of democracy.   

It’s because in the last 60 years, when democracy was spread to 

Germany, and to Japan, and to Spain, and to Latin America, and 

to South Asia, and to Eastern Europe, and even to Russia, it was 

never spread to Middle East.  And one can say, but you cannot 

impose democracy freedom from outside, of course you can’t 

impose freedom from outside.   But, we find out that you can 

impose dictatorship from outside, simply by supporting dictators.  

And that’s unfortunately exactly what so many leaders of the free 

world were doing.  They were supporting and they continued to 

support, royal Saudis.   Ignoring the fact what’s happening there 

with the rights of even [UNCLEAR].  They supported and continue 

to support…uh, au—au— authoritarian regime of Egypt.  

Ignoring the fact that practically every week, there is another 

human rights activist sent to prison.   They were supporting 

Saddam Hussein, until the last day.  Day before Saddam Hussein 

sent troops to Kuwait, leaders of Europe and United States of 

America believed that he was a good reliable partner, who can get 

[UNCLEAR] stability.   Decades before American President started 

speaking about promoting the freedom of the Middle East, Al 

Qaeda was born, that was already the place plagued with wars, 

with killing, and with repression.   Was Middle East safer, before 

America started talking about promoting democracy.  What is—

was it safer in the ‘70s, when Jordan had to fight PLO and Syria,

when Lebanon was almost destroyed with civil war, when Iranian 

re—regime in— emerged, and the American diplomats turned 

into refugees.   Was Middle East more safe in the ‘80s, when the 

American airplane was blown up by, uh, Libya.  When in Beirut 

and [UNCLEAR] hundreds of American soldiers were killed.  

When one million citizens became victims, killed and wounded, in 

the war between Iran and Iraq.   Has the Middle East been more 

safe in ‘90s, when Kuwait was sw—swallowed up, by Iraq.  When 

missiles were fired—falling on Tel Aviv and Riyadh.  When twin 

towers survived…the first attack of the terrorists.  And when Al 

Qaeda published its famous fatwa, about killing Americans.  

Promoting democracy in the Middle East is an excellent idea, by 

the way I, I [UNCLEAR] idea that it has to be connected with 

human rights.   That the policy of the free world has—in the 

Middle East has to be connected with the question of human 

rights, that’s exactly what I was promoting for all my years.  

Unfortunately, all the administrations of the United States of 

America in the ‘70s and the ‘80s and the ‘90s, never did it.   

Promoting democracy in the Middle East is an excellent idea, 

that’s very—the thing is, how.  It’s very difficult to overcome the 

resistance of all those who don’t want democracy there.

NATAN SHARANSKY 

And that’s a very important question.  But it’s not the question 

which we are discussing today, till this day the question which is 

discussed is, whether it is good idea or not.  The march of 

freedom, ladies and gentlemen, is very difficult.  It will not 

succeed in one day.  But there is no alternative.  Great struggles 

between those who on one side, those millions, hundreds of 

millions in the Middle East, who want freedom, and those who 

want to deprive them of freedom.   The problem is that sometimes 

we forget on whose side we are.  The globe was blessed, and I 

personally was blessed, with America for—which always knew on 

what side it is.  America which knew that, this divide between 

free world and fear societies, is much more important than divide 

between Republicans and Democrats, between this and that 

party.   America which knew that ideal freedom…is bigger than 

any president, any party, any country.    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Thank you, Natan Sharansky—   

NATAN SHARANSKY 

Thank you.   

ROBERT SIEGEL  

—speaking against the motion.  [APPLAUSE]  Uh…we have heard 

the opening presentations by all six of our panelists, we now 

enter our question-and-answer session, folks will come to, uh, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM             Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

get a microphone near members of the audience who want to 

pose a question, I want to start by, uh, picking up on something 

that Natan Sharansky has said and have…uh, we’ll  have Flynt 

Leverett or another member of this panel answer it.   Uh, can one 

be an advocate for human rights or should one be an advocate for 

human rights, without at least implicitly criticizing the entire 

dictatorial structure of a government that might violate human 

rights, or ultimately, if we’re going to support anybody whose 

human rights are violated…should we not follow through and 

say, why not become more democratic while you’re at it.   

SHIBLEY TELHAMI 

May—may—if I may, um, I’d like to answer this one.  Um, you 

know, I—I think there are two big differences here.  Uh, one 

difference is, that, when we are saying we’re spreading democracy 

or we’re shaping institutions a long ways, that we imagine 

ourselves but there is no consensus or international norms, 

that’s one thing.   But when we are talking about human rights 

there, uh, there are human rights treaties, there are international 

laws, there are norms against torture.  And many of these 

governments in the Middle East are signatories to these treaties.   

And therefore, it is a very different order of things, to hold them 

accountable to those treaties.  And it is—and you would get a lot 

more international support rather than be exposed and be alone 

in pushing a policy that other people are not doing.   And these

                                                   “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea” (9/18/07) Page 39. 

 

 

 

governments can and must respond, particularly when the 

international pressure comes.  So that’s one difference that is 

extremely important because we can mobilize supporter, we can 

strengthen institutions, we can do it, but the other difference is, 

is that we—   There are two…uh, the difficulty in imposing 

democracy, is a, another order beyond—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Mm-hmm.   

SHIBLEY TELHAMI 

—uh, trying to uphold people on, on human rights because I 

want to say this on, on democracy because I think, we don’t have 

modesty here, it’s like saying, trust us, we can spread democracy.  

And we don’t have a good record.  Even scholars don’t know how 

to do it.   And yet we want to make it a priority, when in fact, we 

haven’t been able to do even lesser things very well.    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Shibley Telhami answered that question.  Uh, are you satisfied 

with that, Natan Sharansky, that you can separate human rights 

out from a—a broader—   

NATAN SHARANSKY 

No, I—I think—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

—political critique—

NATAN SHARANSKY 

I think that’s exactly the ways of more, more, more than relatives 

[PH].  That there is constant attempt to separate the question of 

human rights from the nature of societies.  That, like 

some…organization of human rights say we are not make 

different mark— giving marks to regimes, we don’t say what 

regime is good and bad.   And as a result, we can have one page 

about violations of human rights in Syria, and 100 pages of 

violations of human rights, about in America, and everyone says, 

well you see America is much worse.   And I always say you 

know, have the same information, it’s very important to me that 

American [UNCLEAR] will all be criticized for human rights.  But 

rights [UNCLEAR] authoritarian regimes, or totalitarian regimes 

and democratic regimes.   And to be clear that, 100 pages about 

democratic regime is not the same as one line about 

authoritarian regime.  Unfortunately, the [UNCLEAR] of human 

rights was absolutely separated from the nature of the regimes 

themselves.   

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Well, at—at this moment, uh, perhaps we’ll have some follow-up 

on this point, but I—I want to, uh, report to you how you voted 

before you heard from our debaters.  On the motion, uh, that 

spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea, 46%, uh, 

of you in the audience using your keypads voted for the motion.

36% voted against the motion, and 18% were undecided.  So 

those were the pre-debate results, and we’ll vote again, a little bit 

later.  Uh…  Just on this—this point of human rights, uh, Flynt 

Leverett, did you, did you have something to add to—to your 

side?   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

Yeah—yeah, I just wanted to say, yes, it is possible to make that 

separation and it actually works in the real world.  Um, one of the 

few things I did in my, um, service at the Bush White House of 

which I am unreservedly proud, is that I drafted the letter that 

President Bush sent to President Mubarek in 2002 regarding the 

detention of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, the, the scholar—    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Democracy advocate in—   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

—yes—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

—in Egypt.    

FLYNT LEVERETT 

Um, and basically the tack we took in that letter was, um, we 

were at that point discussing the possibility of, um, uh, 

additional aid to Israe—to Egypt beyond what Egypt was already 

receiving.  And we simply said in the letter, you know, you’re 

doing this to Saad has made it impossible for us to move ahead

with any kind of initiative like this.   We also said in the letter, 

you know, existing aid and our strategic cooperation, you know, 

we hope will go on.  Um, but we sent the—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

[UNCLEAR]   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

—but we sent the signal that you can’t get—   

NATAN SHARANSKY 

That’s promoting democracy—

LIZ CHENEY 

Sure.  [LAUGHS]    

FLYNT LEVERETT 

…in the end, Saad was released in pretty short order after that 

letter was sent because—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

But the offense that you were addressing, Flynt, was, he’s in jail, 

you weren’t saying, we want to adopt his reform agenda for 

democracy—   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

No, we were saying we want him out of jail.   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Hmm.  It’s a start— 

LIZ CHENEY 

Can I respond on that, because I think that’s a—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Liz Cheney.   

LIZ CHENEY 

—that’s a—what, what Flynt has described is accurate, uh, and it 

is a key—a terrific example of how the US promotes democracy, it 

is one of the tools to use.  Um, Saad Eddin was in jail because 

he’d been a threat to the regime, because he’d supposedly written 

an article about the succession in Egypt, he’d written things the 

regime did not appreciate.   He was imprisoned, he was a

prisoner of conscience.  And at some point, from, from the 

perspective of US policy, it became unacceptable to us, and we, 

we said to the Mubarek regime we will no longer continue this 

level of aid, we will consider future levels of aid at risk—   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

Though we will continue at a present level—    

LIZ CHENEY 

Uh, if you—if you—  Right, we will consider future levels of aid at 

risk if you go down this path, and potentially, in following years, 

additional amounts would be at risk.  At the same it—   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

[INAUDIBLE]  

LIZ CHENEY 

Flynt, I was also there but let me finish, I gave you a chance.  At 

the same time, we said to the government of Egypt, we’re gonna 

take part of the assistance that we are already giving you, and we 

are gonna set it aside from democracy promotion activities.   And 

we are going to fund activities that you may or may not agree 

with us on, we are not gonna ask your approval every time we 

provide assistance to a women’s rights organization, or to a 

political organization.   Uh, we are gonna be promoting 

democracy, we would rather do this hand in hand, we would 

rather find ways that we can work together, but it’s US taxpayers’ 

money and we wanna see it spent in the cause of freedom.   So I

think it’s important to, to note that this is just one example of the 

kinds of tools we use, um, to effectively help to support the 

spread of freedom.   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Danielle Pletka?   

DANIELLE PLETKA 

I think it’s also important and it’s a little bit unfair perhaps but it 

is important to bear a little bit of witness to what Saad Eddin 

Ibrahim has done since he was released, uh, from prison, uh, 

with the good offices of Flynt, Liz, and, and other folks in the 

Bush administration, and that is that he has been an untiring 

and, extraordinarily annoying to the Mubarek regime, voice for 

change—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Reform—   

DANIELLE PLETKA 

—for reform, and he said to the President of the United States in 

the presence of Natan and others at a recent conference in 

Prague, why do you not do more.  Why do you not stand up for 

us.  Now, that’s not the three of us or the three of you.  That is a 

reformer in the Middle East who’s calling upon us to use our 

power.  And I think that that is what we need to reflect, those 

voices—

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Dimitri Simes.    

DIMITRI SIMES 

You know—   When I hear this argument, that we should criticize 

every government, uh, we disagreement with in terms of their 

domestic practices, I want to ask people in the audience before 

the vote, to ask themselves…when was the last time you 

assaulted, even if for rhetorically, your business partners.  When 

if you are a lawyer, when was the last time you told a judge that 

he was a jerk.  Uh, when you came to school where your children 

study, and there told the principal that you have no confidence in 

them.   You know what…if you have to work with people, not 

because you appointed them, not because you selected them, but 

because you need to work with them, you have to know when to 

stop.  You don’t need to praise them artificially.   You do not need 

to pretend like President Bush did, that, uh, President Putin had 

a wonderful pro-democracy soul.  [LAUGHTER]  But, you do 

understand that if you need Egypt, if you need the Saudis, to 

help you with the Middle East peace process, to create an 

impression that we are trying to overthrow their governments, 

well, you know, it’s a little inconsistent.  [LAUGHTER]   It is 

counterproductive.  And I think like with every good thing, we 

need to know when to stop.  And the Bush administration did not 

know, and still does not know when to stop.  [APPLAUSE]

LIZ CHENEY 

I need to say one thing in response to that though, and I know 

Natan wants to answer too.  9-11 changed that.  And after 

September 11th, we were very clearly in a situation where it 

wasn’t us talking to our children’s teacher.  It was us saying to 

governments in the region, conditions inside your countries have 

become a national security challenge, threat, concern for us.   It’s 

not us saying that we are going to…impose democracy, saying 

that we’re going to invade every country in the Middle East as are 

some of the straw men that are, that are held up, but much more 

us saying, look, we are threatened by the conditions in your 

country.   We are threatened as a nation because your children 

are living in despair, because your children have no hope, 

because they can’t speak, because they go to schools where 

they’re teaching hatred, and violence and intolerance.   Those 

things are not sort of your concerns which have no impact on us, 

and anybody who lived through 9-11 has thought about the fact 

that that danger came here to our shores, primarily from 

countries in that region which are not allowing freedom for their 

people.   You have to understand that their freedom is not just 

right but it’s a national security interest for the United States—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Shib—Shibley Telhami has the last word of this exchange—

SHIBLEY TELHAMI 

What Liz has just said is actually rather revealing, because I 

think that’s an argument about, uh, not democracy as an end in 

itself but as an instrument to en—to American security, it’s a—

it’s a—   

LIZ CHENEY 

It’s both.  It’s absolutely both—   

SHIBLEY TELHAMI 

Well—you, you know, you can’t have it both ways, and I think if 

this is the tack that was taken, uh, this is part of the problem, 

you have to make an evaluation, has it served our security, even 

if you don’t make a judgment about democracy, uh, in the same 

way that we did have a—   I think many people in the American 

political mainstream came to believe that, somehow terrorism is a 

function of the absence of democracy.  First of all, scho—scholars 

don’t agree on that necessary.  But, but, let’s assume that that 

was the case.   Then you have to make an assessment whether 

we have more terrorism or less terrorism, as a consequence of the 

policy that we have undertaken, and I think, everybody could 

look now and make an assessment on where we are in the Middle 

East, there’s more—  There’s no doubt, that there is more Al 

Qaeda in the Middle East than there was before, in our world 

certainly, and, there is more terrorism in the Middle East than 

before.  So it hasn’t worked with our national security, and it is

being in a way, argued both as an end in itself and an instrument 

of security, when in fact, even the scholars who believe it’s 

possible to do it, believe it’ll take years to do and then meanwhile, 

all you have is instability.   And what instability is correlated 

with, is more terrorism.  And that is why we can’t have it both 

ways, so when Hamas gets elected, uh, you’re stuck.  You don’t 

know what to do.  That’s the problem.    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Natan Sharansky’s gonna make a liar of me and insist on—   

NATAN SHARANSKY 

Yeah, I—I want only—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

—having the last word—   

NATAN SHARANSKY 

No, I want only to, to react to the jokes of Mr. Simes because they 

sounded for me like kind of déjà vu.  And I understood why.  

Because they are exactly those arguments of those who explained 

to us why Soviet Union should not be called Evil Empire.  Why 

Soviet Union should not be restricted in it trade with the United 

States.  Why should not be massive demonstrations for Soviet 

Jews when Soviet officials are coming.  If these jokes were heard 

then and there you were very strong.  If they would listen to 

them, I would still be in prison.  [APPLAUSE]

Well, you know—

Is there—no, is there a question for—

When I came to the United States, one of the first things, uh, I 

did, was, uh, to become a secretary of the advisory board of the 

Union of Councils for Soviet Jews.  And I was a strong supporter 

of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.   

NATAN SHARANSKY 

So—   

DIMITRI SIMES 

There is absolutely no contradiction, between, uh…helping 

people like Mr. Sharansky, who is a genuine hero, and whose 

courage I greatly admire, and also understanding some practical 

interests.  Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union an Evil Empire.   

Ronald Reagan also, immediately after his assassination, uh, 

wrote a handwritten letter to Leonid Brezhnev, suggesting that 

they should find a way to work together.  You need to find the 

balance.  The Bush administration doesn’t know how to do it.

from the audience on the, on the aisle, sir.  And, may I say that, 

uh… please, ask your questions after someone has arrived with a

yourself.   Uh, if you’re not a member of the press you—you have

ARTHUR SCHIFF 

What if you wanna be a member of the press.  [LAUGHTER]   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

If you’re an aspiring member of the press you may also identify 

yourself—   

ARTHUR SCHIFF 

My name is Arthur Schiff, my question is, uh, this, what is the 

moral responsibility of the United States, to that fraction of the 

population in oppressed countries, and specifically for example 

the people we left behind in Vietnam and the people we left 

behind in Iraq in ’91—   What is the moral responsibility of the 

US to those people who advocate, care about, are willing to 

sacrifice themselves, endanger their lives, because they are 

committed to democracy, and irrespective of everything else see 

the US as that bastion of democratic hope.    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Let me ask Liz Cheney, if people sign up in one of these countries 

for the campaign for democracy at America’s urging, and then 

they find themselves on the outs, uh, by a, uh, a new strong 

man, what’s our obligation to those people—

LIZ CHENEY 

Well I think it’s an excellent question, I think that, um, the record 

of the United States in 1991 in Iraq after calling on the Shia in 

particular to rise up and then not being there to support them, 

um, is a shame.   And I think it’s something very much our 

enemies look to.  I think it’s also, uh, something that our allies 

look to.  I think that, those who argue for example that we should 

leave Iraq today, those who argue that we should pull out of the 

Middle East today, um, I have not heard them explain what that 

would mean for the millions of people who have believed us when 

we’ve said that we are standing for freedom, we’re stranding for a 

new Middle East.   And in fact…I think that, that, in response to 

one of the points Shibley was making, we have a convergence, it’s 

a—it’s, often, uh, unusual, maybe too unusual.  But we have a 

convergence today, between what is the right thing to do morally.   

What is the right thing to do to live up to America’s heritage, and 

America’s proper role in the world, which is to promote freedom 

where we can.  A convergence between that and America’s 

national security interest, which is that today, promoting freedom 

in the Middle East will make us safer and has made us safer, and 

I disagree with Shibley, you don’t have to choose.   When you 

have a situation where there’s a convergence between those two 

objectives, um, it seems to me that it’s pretty clear that the path 

you go do down is to undertake that policy.   On the issue of

                                                   “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea” (9/18/07) Page 53. 

 

 

 

whether it’s made us safer I would only point out that during the 

1990s when the United States was in fact undertaking the policy 

that they have advocated, we were attacked in 1993, 1998, 2000.  

Since 2001, we have not been attacked again.   Now, you can talk 

about what’s happening in the region, we can argue about that, 

we can argue about the war in Iraq, as I said I welcome that, I 

welcome the opportunity to do that.  But you cannot ignore the 

fact that since we have been promoting democracy in the Middle 

East, since we have been standing on the side of those for 

freedom, as messy, as complicated, as difficult as it is, Al Qaeda 

has not attacked us here in the US again.   It’s not only because 

of that policy, absolutely, it’s because of…uh, our own policies to 

take the fight to the enemy, it’s because of what we’ve done to 

protect the homeland.  But surely that policy has been part of it, 

and you cannot ignore that absence of attacks if you make the 

argument that we’re not safer.    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

I think Flynt Leverett has something to say about that.   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

Yeah.  America’s moral obligation to the kinds of people that you 

were describing, is first of all, not to lead such people to believe 

that we will support them in ways that in the end, we will not 

provide.   Our first moral obligation is not to mislead people.  Our 

second moral obligation, particularly in relation to Iraq, is not to

go to war, when we do not have a coherent and plausible plan for 

stabilizing a country like that, after we have overthrown the 

regime.  To do that, I would argue, is the height of moral 

irresponsibility.    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

We have a—  [APPLAUSE]  A question from the audience.    

AUDIENCE MEMBER (male) 

Uh, I have a question for, uh, the side, uh, arguing for the 

proposition.  And granted of course that the United States 

sometimes does have to make compromises, uh, with dictatorial 

regimes and sometimes in fact has to wind up being allied with 

dictatorial regimes, most famously of course in the case of World 

War II.   But what I’m wondering is, are there any regimes so 

reprehensible in the world today or in recent history, that the 

side arguing for the proposition would say that we cannot be 

allied with them.   Would you for example say that we should 

have been allied with the Khmer Rouge as they were running 

Cambodia and killing 2 million of their citizens.  Is there some 

point at which we actually should draw the line in terms of 

regimes that we simply cannot stomach.   And if so what is that 

line and how do you differ, and differentiate between that, and 

some of the regimes that we in fact have supported for years in 

the Middle East.

DIMITRI SIMES 

Well, I—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Is there a red line.   

DIMITRI SIMES 

I most definitely would not be allied with Khmer Rouge.  I most 

definitely would not be allied with Ahmadinejad, and I most 

definitely think it was a mistake for us in the past to be seen 

allied with Saddam Hussein.  But I would have to make one 

qualifier.   That is unless of course, we are facing an apocalyptic 

threat.  That is why Winston Churchill decided to be allied with 

Stalin.  And if you would look at Churchill’s record, vis-à-vis 

Communism, he probably was most brutal in, uh, being quite 

honest about what a horrible regime they had in the Soviet Union 

at that time.   But in comparison with Hitler, and I’m not even 

sure quite that Churchill was making just a moral judgment, he 

was making a strategic judgment, he felt that Britain had no 

choice, and let me say this.   I wish our foreign policy was a 

morality play.  I wish there was never tension between what we 

wish, and what we know is security interests.  But there is 

tension.  And when we are talking about this tension, we are not 

suggesting that we do not care about the abuse, about those who 

have no voice.   But we are talking about realistic foreign policy 

choices.  And friends, if you believe in democracy, democracy

starts with the serious and informed conversation in home.  

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Shibley Telhami, you had something to add to that?    

SHIBLEY TELHAMI 

Uh, well I—I agree first of all that there are people you don’t deal 

with, but you know, the choice isn’t between having an ally and, 

and, and not, I mean, in, in, in most cases there, there are…uh, 

governments that are bad that you don’t deal with or you can 

ignore.   There’s a difference between, uh, uh, applying sanctions 

or applying some international, uh, punishment on a—on a 

regime, and between going to change the system.  Uh, I think 

that, uh, we’re in a great position, uh, and we were after 9-11, to 

mobilize the international community over issues that were of 

great importance not just to us but to everyone else.   And 

human rights is included in that.  And, we have international 

forums, uh, for a, in which we can take this, we still are the most 

powerful nation, and peop—we could’ve led in international 

organizations, uh, to tighten, to, to punish, to, uh, to, uh, exclude 

people who were violating human rights in the international 

system, I believe that we need to do that.   I think it is important 

to have moral values.  I think that, national interest cannot 

explain all of what we do, I don’t wanna just be serving my 

material interests, I’m a—I’m a moral individual, I want my 

country to stand for moral issues, I don’t deny that.   I think we

can—are capable of it, if we’re not capable of it as a—as the 

United States of America, no country is.  We’re far too powerful, 

not to have something extra to push for the good in the world 

beyond.  What I’m calling for, is more modesty, more selectivity, 

more…international, uh, organization, uh, type action.  Uh, not 

the sort of, uh, I don’t wanna say—arrogance probably is the 

word, in this particular case, to say that we know what is best 

and we’re going to bring it about, that’s not values.   Especially, 

when the morning after, people are far worse as they are in Iraq, 

than many of them were the day before.  That is not values, that 

is not spreading good in the world, that is not, when you have 

more than 2 million refugees, most of whom we’re not even trying 

to provide for.   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Danielle Pletka has a, has a response to what you’ve said, 

Shibley—   

DANIELLE PLETKA 

I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have a, uh, a ques—a response, I have a 

question, um, I would like to ask our compatriots whether, uh, 

had they had the opportunity, um, and were in a position to do 

so prior to 9-11, would they have worked to overthrow or change 

the regime in Afghanistan and remove the Taliban.

DANIELLE PLETKA 

Oh, good.  Go for it, Dimitri.   

DIMITRI SIMES 

I was, uh…uh, bus-riding.  And talking to people in the 

administration, including, uh, to the Secretary of State… about, 

uh, the need to establish American priorities.  And after World 

Trade Center, after what was done to American, embassies in 

Africa, I felt very strongly, that the big target had to be, Taliban, 

and of course Al Qaeda.   However, the administration at that 

time was so upset with what was happening in Russia, and so 

eager to reduce increasing [UNCLEAR] Russia down to size, that 

they ignored, then Prime Minister Putin, he was not President 

yet, Prime Minister Putin, suggestions, that the United States and 

Russia would work together against Taliban.   Similar felt, that 

we, instead of focusing on all kinds of things including democracy 

promotion in Pakistan, had to make that that very issue, 

Pakistani support for Taliban, the central issue in our dialogue 

with that government.   But we treated foreign policy as a 

Christmas tree.  We did not want to establish priorities.  We 

wanted to do everything at the time.  We cannot conduct an 

experiment in history, I do not know whether to attack Taliban 

with the Russians, and with the Pakistanis, whether we would be 

able to prevent September 11th.

One short note is simply in support of Winston Churchill, 

because it was mentioned correctly that Winston Churchill had 

no choice but to cooperate with Stalin to fight Hitler.  But 

immediately after the war, he was the first to declare the 

beginning of Cold War.  He was the first to recognize who—what 

is the nature of Soviet Union.  And he brought back that moral 

clarity, which is lacking so much today, thank you.   

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Well, thank you very much for your answers to my questions and 

the questions we’ve taken from the audience, and we’ve managed 

to debate not only the spread of democracy in the Middle East 

today but the, uh…uh, alliance between the United States,

Britain and Soviet Union during the Second World War—

and you’ll yet have another chance to raise these points now in 

closing, uh, statements which are to run maximum two minutes.  

Uh, and we begin with, uh, Natan Sharansky.  Against the 

resolution.    

NATAN SHARANSKY 

Well, uh, it was mentioned already today that some time ago, I 

together with Vaclav Havel organized an international conference 

in Prague on security and democracy.  And it became like a kind 

of international meeting of democratic dissidents from all over the 

world but first of all from Middle East.   For there were so many 

democratic dissidents from Iran and Iraq and Libya and Syria, 

and Sudan and Egypt and so on.  I know by listening to the 

stories of these people, I think they themselves, were surprised to 

discover how each of them has the same story.   Of personal 

struggle, a person who wants to be free and wants his country to 

be free, against totalitarian regime.  And, uh, it was easy to 

recognize the stories of our dissident stories, mine and Vaclav 

Havel’s then, and theirs today.   With one difference.  We knew… 

that if we go to prison all the free world will be with us.  They 

know that they, when they go to prison, the free world is debating 

whether it is in our interest to support them, or their…uh, or the 

people who jailed them.

ROBERT SIEGEL 

One.    

NATAN SHARANSKY 

And that’s a big problem.  Frankly speaking, I’d like on today’s 

debate, Abraham Lincoln who’s been speaking together with us.  

Because, this President when he came to the office… black 

Americans were slaves, and even had to rights to walk.  If he was 

asked if it is good idea to promote democracy, is it…good idea to 

impose democracy, is stability should be preferred to democracy, 

what he would answer.   He once said—I don’t remember exact 

quote, I don’t [UNCLEAR] something like this—we will not be the 

masters, we will not be the slaves.  We of course, we are, thank 

God, we are not slaves.  We must make sure that we are not 

supporting the masters.   To promote democracy, it’s first of all to 

stop supporting tyr—tyrants in the Middle East.   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Thank you, uh, Natan Sharansky, now…  [APPLAUSE]  Now for 

the resolution, Flynt Leverett.   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

I think that…in making your vote this evening, you have, in many 

ways, a quite simple choice.  If you believe that the alternative to 

the house of Saud, the alternative to the Mubarek regime, is a 

group of Western-educated Jeffersonian democrats, then you 

ought to vote against the resolution.   If you believe as I do,  that

under current circumstances the alternatives to these incumbent 

regimes will actually be worse for American interests, and, I 

think, worse for the people in these countries, then you should 

vote for the resolution.   It is a red herring to say that by saying 

democracy promotion in the Middle East is a bad idea, we 

basically are washing our hands of any concern about how the 

Middle East develops.   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

One—   

FLYNT LEVERETT 

That is simply not true.  There is an enormous ferment in the 

Persian Gulf today, around economic reform, around, as Liz 

pointed out, the spread of information technologies, the 

increasing involvement of the Gulf states, and other Middle 

Eastern countries in the globalized world of the 21st century.   

That is not a product of American policy, in fact I would say we’re 

not doing enough to support those developments.  Egypt can get 

a free-trade agreement with the European Union but it can’t get a 

free-trade agreement with us.   That’s nuts, we ought to be 

supporting economic reform in these countries, we ought to be 

standing up for human rights, and the political development in 

these countries will then, over time, take care of itself, and in the 

meantime, we will be much better positioned to fight terror, 

protect the security of the state of Israel, and protect our most

vital interests in the Gulf—   

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Thank you, Flynt Leverett.  Speaking for the resolution.  

[APPLAUSE]  Liz Cheney, against.    

LIZ CHENEY 

Um, I think it’s important as you vote tonight to think about the 

fact that all three of those arguing for the motion, have argued 

our point.  Flynt’s just argued that we ought to be supporting the 

changes that we’re seeing in the Gulf, not just the economic 

changes but the expansion of information technology, the 

expansion of freedom of the press, that’s part of democracy.   

Dimitri argued that we ought to be supporting freedom of choice.  

That’s what we’re doing.  Um, and Shibley said we should 

advocate democracy, we just ought to do it differently.  So I think 

that it’s important for us to focus on what is the debate here 

tonight,  but when we’ve got all three of our opponents arguing 

that, that the policy itself may have flaws but that in one way or 

another we ought to be advocating democracy, human rights, 

freedom, economic reform, uh, it is, uh…hard not to imagine 

that, that what is, um, urging them to argue for this motion, is a 

disagreement about our Iraq policy, a disagreement about George 

Bush, a disagreement about our foreign policy in general.

LIZ CHENEY 

And I think it’s critically important to recognize this isn’t a game.  

There are real people, real men and women, as I mentioned 

across the region today, tonight, tomorrow, who believe America 

will stand with them for freedom.   And I think that, that the, uh, 

great moral disservice that we would do, we could do to them, the 

greatest moral disservice we could do to them would be to fold 

our tent in the face of terrorist attack, to fold our tent in the face 

of extremists, who don’t believe that women should be equal, who 

don’t believe in freedom of religion, who don’t believe in freedom 

of speech.   Our opponents have also said we need a balanced 

policy, we need to work with regimes when they can help us in 

the war on terror, and at the same time we need to be supporting 

freedom.  That’s what we do.   You can say we don’t do it the way 

you would do it, we could have a debate about how to do it more 

effectively, but at the end of the day, that is what we’re doing, 

that is what the policy is, and I think it’s critically important that 

we don’t abandon those who are standing with us, to help build a 

world in which we don’t have to fear attack by terrorists.

rights, not words to claim we are doing it, and not promises that 

we can in fact do it.  The train wreck is too long to miss.  It is 

easy to sell dreams in times of pain, and many after the horror of 

9-11 so badly wanted answers.  And visions of spreading 

democracy were too good to resist.  If something is imaginable, 

we thought, it is possible.   If something is possible, we thought, 

it is likely.  Thus is the stuff of wishful thinking.  It would still be 

worth a dream if the costs and reality were not so unbearably 

high, if it weren’t for the fact that the morning after, has been 

even worse than the day before.  That millions are paying the

—and there is a time to go with your mind.  And this is the time 

to go with your mind.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Thank you…Shibley Telhami.  Danielle Pletka, against the 

motion.    

DANIELLE PLETKA 

Flynt suggested in his closing remarks that, uh, that if the United 

States harps on the treaty obligations of, uh, of our, our Arab 

dictator, uh, friends, then perhaps there will be a greater 

adherence to human rights.   Um, I recall the Iranian signature of

the International Atomic Energy Agency’s nuclear non-

proliferation treaty, um, which was not a very effective treaty that 

was signed, uh, North Korea, same.  Uh, all the counter-terrorism 

treaties, the genocide treaties, the chemical weapons 

conventions.   Pieces of paper make bureaucrats in Washington 

feel good.  They enable them to come home with victories that 

they can trumpet on the front page of the Washington Post and 

the New York Times.  But it doesn’t do a great deal for the people 

who live in these countries, the 300 million people of the Middle 

East and North Africa who don’t live in freedom.   As I came here 

today and looked out the window and you can see signs hanging 

from institutions, synagogues in particular that say—   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

One.    

DANIELLE PLETKA 

—“Save Darfur.”  Why is it that we have a special regard for 

Darfur, but not for the 300 million of the Middle East and North 

Africa who have lived so long with torture, without freedom, and 

yes, with genocide as well.  Our past failings should not dictate 

our future failings.   And our hearts and our minds should work 

together, for the right thing in the national interest.  Yes, it’s true, 

Hitler was elected by democracy.  But that does not discredit 

democracy.  To the contrary, those who are willing to accept that 

decision, and do nothing in the face of the reality that Hitler was

an evil, ruthless tyrant, were the Chamberlains.   And those who 

spoke out to depose and to act and to spread democracy and 

change in national interest, were with Churchill.  And I think 

history will judge those who stood on the other side very harshly 

in this regard as well.   

ROBERT SIEGEL 

Danielle Pletka.  [APPLAUSE]  And in conclusion Dimitri Simes 

for the motion.    

DIMITRI SIMES 

Like Mr. Sharansky, I also lived in the Soviet Union.  And, uh, for 

most of us, the United States was a shining castle.  And the 

United States stood, not only for prosperity and freedom for the 

United States, but also for freedom for the rest of us.   The big 

difference however, for—between standing for this kind of 

freedom, and what we have witnessed during last several years, 

that every American President, before this one, was taking the 

position that we would protect and defend freedom of Americans, 

and of the allies.   And whenever possible, would protect freedom 

of other nations.  The country was not taking upon themselves, 

telling others on a global scale how they’re supposed to live.  And 

when you go to the world, and offer indispensable guidance, 

particularly when you are not particular popular, when you—

DIMITRI SIMES 

—are not particularly liked, you know what?  It creates a 

backlash.  The debate tonight is not about freedom.  The debate 

tonight is whether we want to have a foreign policy which makes 

us feel good, or do we have to have foreign policy judged by 

results.  And I am convinced, the dissidents in Iran, democrats in 

Iraq, they want results, not rhetoric.  That is why I am in favor of 

this resolution.    

ROBERT SIEGEL  

Thank you, Dimitri Simes.  [APPLAUSE]  And so we’ve heard the 

concluding remarks, it’s now time to vote.  Uh, once again, please 

pick up the keypad that’s attached to the left arm-rest of your 

seat, and after my prompt, press “1” if you are for the motion, the 

motion again being, that spreading democracy in the Middle East 

is a bad idea, “2” if you’re against the motion, and “3” if you are 

undecided.  Please cast your vote now.   

[PAUSE]   

ROBERT SIEGEL  

We’ll have the results in a moment.  I want to thank the debaters,

before I announce the results of the audience vote I wanna take 

care of a few things, first, this is the first debate of the second
