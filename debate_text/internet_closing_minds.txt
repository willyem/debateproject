Robert Rosenkranz: 
Thank you and welcome.  Well, I don't mean to be a name dropper, but last week I 
posed our resolution to two of my dinner partners, Rupert Murdoch and George W. 
Bush. 
 
[laughter] 
 
They both had strong views, and both were against the motion.  Murdoch was 
vehement that FOX News is not polarizing, but presents -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- but presents a more balanced view than the other networks and attracts an audience 
that is 40 percent Democrat, which I thought was an interesting statistic.  And President

Bush argued that in most of the world, the internet has opened minds to the way of life 
in the liberal democracies and has been a hugely constructive force for change.   
 
18:46:45 
 
He acknowledged the extreme polarization of American politics, but blamed it on the 
class warfare rhetoric of his successor.  Whenever one thinks of their points, they do 
illuminate some of the subtleties in the language of our resolution.  Murdoch correctly 
grasped that it does not posit that the internet is the sole or even the primary driver of 
the narrow ideologies that seem to dominate politics.  Rather, he understood the 
internet as part of a broader trend toward a highly fragmented media.  And President 
Bush, by taking the resolution in a global context, prompts me to clarify that what we 
expect to talk about tonight is American politics.  Why might be the internet be closing 
our minds?  The first reason is that the internet makes it very easy to tailor the 
information we get to conform to a preconceived world view.   
 
18:47:46 
 
We can choose news aggregators on the left or on the right, not to mention highly 
ideological bloggers and live our lives without encountering any contrary opinion.  In a 
great little essay called, "Why Groups Go to Extremes," Cass Sunstein, the Obama 
administration's regulatory czar, demonstrated empirically that discussing issues with 
like-minded folks tends to make positions more extreme.  In addition to self selection, 
the internet makes it easy for websites to, "personalize our offerings."  It seems 
innocuous, even helpful when Netflix tells us that the viewers who enjoyed movie A also 
enjoyed movie B.  But if you Google federal deficit or Medicare reform, is it healthy for 
your search to come up differently than mine based on what Google has been able to 
infer about our political leanings?   
 
18:48:43 
 
Those against the motion will argue that the internet is a vast information utility which 
facilitates search, learning and communications.  Personalization may be a blessing, 
simply helping us make the choices we want to make.  We can turn personal filters on or 
off, so there's no real danger here.  And little hard evidence that Google has helped us 
erect mental fortresses through which contrary ideas are not allowed to penetrate.  
Indeed, the filters from the pre-internet era, three like-minded networks and a handful 
of local newspapers, were arguably less hospitable to views outside American census 
than the open marketplace and information and ideas we have today.  To illuminate the 
complexities here, we have four distinguished experts, and it's now my privilege to turn 
the evening over to them and to our moderator, John Donvan.

Thank you.  And I would just like to invite one more round of applause for the

[applause] 
 
Yes or no to this statement: "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our 
minds."  The state of the online debate, that is what we're debating here tonight.  
Welcome from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four superbly 
qualified debaters, two against two.  And what we're touching on here -- well, it starts 
with this, a sampling of this, and see if it's familiar.  This is a recent exchange among 
Wall Street Journal readers who were posting to each other about health care or 
actually posting at each other.  Glen, the liberal, just had his argument attacked by 
David, the conservative.  Glen gets mad.  “One wonders how you can even press the 
keys on the keyboard.  Please just go away."   
 
18:50:44 
 
David responds, "Now I know you're a liberal because liberals are rude and will not 
listen to any reason."  A guy named Kevin joins in the attack, and he tells Glen to read up 
on economics and civics.  Glen tells Kevin, "Put this in your pipe and smoke it, you 
pseudo intellectual rube."  From nowhere, a guy named Mark weighs in.  He tells Glen 
that he is "intellectually challenged” and advises him that he needs to “get some 
lithium." 
 
[laughter] 
 
When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds.  Is that what we just heard, 
our minds closing out there, or is it a great thing that these guys are actually out there 
engaging with each other at all?  Our debate goes in three rounds, then the audience 
votes to choose the winner.  Only one side wins.  On the side for our motion, when it 
comes to politics, the internet is changing our minds, Eli Pariser, a board member and 
former executive director of MoveOn.org. 
 
[applause] 
 
His partner is Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor and chair of the Department of Media 
Studies at the University of Virginia.

Arguing against the motion that when it comes to politics, the internet is changing our 
minds, Evgeny Morozov, a Schwartz fellow at the New America Foundation and author 
of "The Net Delusion." 
 
[applause]  
 
And his partner, Jacob Weisberg, chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is, "When it comes to politics, the Internet is closing our minds."  Let's meet 
our debaters now and welcome first Eli Pariser. 
 
[applause] 
 
And Eli, at the age of 20, you joined MoveOn.org to direct its foreign policy campaigns.  
And then a couple of years later, you became its executive director.  You have been an 
online organizer all of your adult life.  But now you are warning about the dangers of the 
internet. So what changed, you or the internet? 
 
Eli Pariser: 
The internet changed more than I did. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  We'll see when you -- when you get up there, we're going to see what you 
mean by that.  Your debating partner, let's welcome Siva Vaidhyanathan. 
 
[applause] 
 
18:52:46 
 
Siva, you are a professor and Department of Media Studies chair at the University of 
Virginia.  You're also author of this book, "The Googlization of Everything and Why We 
Should Worry."  This is actually your second debate with us.  And the first time you were 
debating for the motion, "Google violates its don't be evil motto," and you won.  Do you 
still think -- do you still think Google is evil? 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Well, I never thought Google was evil, but I did think that was an impossible standard 
for any company to hold, so it was actually not that hard to win.  I think the really 
interesting question is, does Google think I'm evil.

John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Our motion is, "When it comes to politics, the Internet is closing our minds."  
Let's meet the team arguing against.  First, Evgeny Morozov. 
 
[applause] 
 
You're a visiting fellow at Stanford University, a Schwartz fellow at the New America 
Foundation.  You wrote a book also, "The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet 
Freedom."  You have said -- this was in a TED talk, that when the internet reaches a 
remote Russian village, people are not going to be sitting there watching reports from 
Human Rights Watch; they're going to be watching pornography, Sex and the City or 
maybe funny videos of cats. 
 
18:53:51  
 
[laughter] 
 
So how worried are you about these cat videos? 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
Well, cats, I think are the new opium of the masses.  And the the  [unintelligible] have 
figured it out, and they exploit perfectly a little thought control. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  And let's meet your debating partner, Jacob Weisberg. 
 
[applause] 
 
Jacob, you are chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group.  Now, you wrote for 
print, for everybody in the old days, the New Republic, New York Magazine, Financial 
Times among other places.  But in 1996, you joined a new online magazine called Slate 
as its chief political correspondent.  That was very early in the game.  So what did you 
know back then? 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Well, John, I was an early visionary.  No, actually, I got very lucky when my friend, 
Michael Kinsley decided to found Slate, and it seemed like a fun thing to do. And it turns 
out it's impossible to go back.

The internet spoils you as a writer because of the freedom you have and the speed. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Thank you, Jacob Weisberg.  Our four debaters, ladies and gentlemen. 
 
[applause] 
 
Now, in this debate, you, our audience, are our judges.  By the time the debate has 
ended, we're going to have asked you to vote two times, once before the debate and 
once again after the debate on the language motion and on your position on it both 
before and after. And what we want to ask you to do now is go to the key pads at your 
seat.  On the right hand side, you'll see a keypad.  And we'll ask you to vote your 
sentiment on this motion as you're coming off the street.  Our motion is, "When it 
comes to politics, the Internet is closing our minds."  If you agree with it, push number 
one.  If you disagree, push number two.  If you're undecided, push number three.  And 
you can ignore the other keys.  And if you want to correct your entry, just correct it, and 
the system will register your last vote.  So that's locked out now.   
 
18:55:41 
 
Again, at the end of the debate, we're going to ask you to vote on the quality of the 
arguments that were presented here tonight, and the team that has the greatest 
differential between this opening vote and the closing vote will be declared by you, our 
audience, their winners.  So we go in three rounds.  The first round is seven minutes, 
each, uninterrupted by each speaker in turn.  So on to round one, opening statements 
from each of our debaters, and going up first for our motion, which is, "When it comes 
to politics, the Internet is closing our minds," Eli Pariser.  He's a MoveOn.org board 
member, CEO of Upworthy.com, and author of, "The Filter Bubble, What the Internet is 
Hiding from You."  That book was the inspiration for our having this debate tonight.  
Ladies and gentlemen, Eli Pariser. 
 
[applause] 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Good evening, everyone.  I find myself arguing that the Internet is closing our minds 
with a bit of regret.  This isn't the place that I would want to be, and actually as of a few 
years ago I would have been arguing the other side, but I've come to believe that the -- 
well, the Internet is incredibly good at getting groups of likeminded people to get 
together, think together, work together.

But it's actually quite bad at bridging between groups of different people, and that the 
view that the Internet is exposing us to all sorts of new ways of thinking and new ideas is 
kind of a dated view, that the Internet's changing, and that there are a few big 
companies that would like us to hold onto that idea that the Internet is still this kind of 
open place.  So the core of my argument is this, attention is the most valuable 
commodity out there right now.  If you command attention, then you can direct it 
towards products or services and you can make a lot of money, and that's why all of the 
big companies on the Internet are trying to figure out what the best strategy is for 
gathering as much of it as possible.  And most of them are focused on the same strategy 
which is gathering as much data about us as they can and then using that data to give us 
what they think, what they predict, based on their -- this data and their algorithms, 
we're going to be interested in.   
 
18:57:45 
 
Relevance is the big watchword here.  So, you know, if you talk to these companies, if 
you look at what they're saying, it's very clear that this is a big part of the business plan.  
Eric Schmidt says, "Very soon it will be nearly impossible to see something that has not 
in some way been tailored to you."  Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, says, "Within the next 
few years, it'll be anachronistic to visit a website that hasn't been customized to your 
personal interests in some way."  And Facebook is becoming this growing source of how 
people get their news and how people get their information.  So why are they doing 
this?  Well, I think Evgeny actually put it really well.  Why does Facebook employ filters?  
The more they know about us, the more they can make in advertising revenues.  And 
the thing is that these companies aren't blind to the psychology of all this. They've read 
all of the studies that show that when you present people with information that 
confirms what they already believed was true, you can actually see these little bursts of 
pleasure happening in people's brains.   
 
18:58:44 
 
And conversely, when people are presented with information that challenges what they 
believed, they get cranky.  That's just the way we're wired.  And so if you're a company 
that's trying to meet stockholder demands and you have this power to present people 
with information that tends to validate them, why wouldn't you?  As a result of this kind 
of personalization and self selection, we're more likely to see things we agree with and 
less likely to see things we disagree with.  Now, to be clear, I'm not arguing that all 
personalization is bad.  Personalization certainly can have benefits.  I'm a Netflix user.  
But the question is, what are the driving motives behind the kind of personalization that 
most people use, and what are the effects of that personalization?  And I'll argue that 
because of the motives of these companies, those filters that they're building are going 
to tend to surround us with information that's agreeable to us and not with information 
that's uncomfortable.

18:59:38 
 
So a few examples of what this looks like in practice, it looks like one person googling 
Egypt and seeing lots of information about the Arab Spring and another person googling 
Egypt at the same time and seeing nothing about the Arab Spring.  This actually 
happened, I've got the screenshots on my website.  And, you know, I could run through 
a number of other anecdotes, but actually there's been a study -- the only peer 
reviewed study I'm aware of on the Google search results and the effects of 
personalization there -- that shows that 60 percent of the search results on a given front 
page are usually personalized.  Either they're in a different order or they're actually, you 
know, totally different results based on who Google thinks you are and what it thinks 
you'll be interested in.  So what I think we have to begin to do is to tease apart what the 
Internet actually does from what we wish it would do or what it possibly could do.  And 
in particular we have to tease apart what's possible to access versus what people do 
access.  For example, now that the -- it's easy now to access the front page of Le Monde 
or Die Zeit, as it is, in fact to access the New York Times.   
 
19:00:47 
 
So you would think, given this vast increase in accessibility of foreign policy, 
information, of what’s going on in other countries, that people would know more about 
what’s going on there.  In fact that’s not true.  According to a Pew study from 2007, 
people actually were more informed on foreign policy matters before the internet than 
in 2007.  So when Jacob says you can find more sources than ever, it’s kind of beside the 
point.  What’s relevant is that people come into daily contact more frequently, is 
whether people come into daily contact with more different sources and more 
particular, different ideological ones.  I agree here again with Evgeny who says the 
regular folk don’t read sites like Global Voices, an aggregator of the most interesting 
blog posts from all over the world.  Instead they are more likely to use the internet to 
rediscover their own culture and dare we say it, their own national bigotry.  So to 
summarize, big companies are rapidly working to personalize your version of the web.   
 
19:01:44 
 
They want to show you what they think you’re going to be interested in.  And this isn't 
passive. This isn’t me turning on Fox News or me turning on -- or picking up a copy of 
the Nation. This is embedded in an increasing number of websites.  Yahoo News in 2007, 
was a gateway for 80 million people that looked the same.  But now, Yahoo runs 13 
million different variations of Yahoo News front page every day.  And they’re different 
for each person.  It’s hard to even see.  We don’t know how tailored our view of the web 
is because you have to sit down next to someone else and look at the differences.  So 
the object of this personalization is to get us to click more.  It’s to get us to like more.  
And importantly, it’s to get us to click on ads.  And there’s little benefit in that world to 
presenting us with information that makes us uncomfortable, that challenges our views,

or that makes us think differently.  I don’t think that this has caused the extreme 
political polarization that we’re seeing right now.  But I think it can’t help but exacerbate 
it.   
 
19:02:42 
 
Google says that it’s trying to provide relevance.  But what is the most relevant search 
result when you’re a 9/11 conspiracy theorist googling 9/11?  Is it the conspiracy links 
that Google’s algorithm would tend to promote or is it the Popular Mechanics article 
that would debunk that stuff?  I asked Google this question and they didn’t really have a 
clear answer. So it’s with regret that I think the Internet is not living up to its potential.  
The way that most people actually use the thing isn’t to broaden their political 
perspectives.  In fact the path that we generally travel on online will tend to mirror our 
political views. Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you Eli Pariser. Our motion is "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing 
our minds."  And here to speak against the motion, Jacob Weisberg.  He is a pioneer in 
online journalism.  Jacob is editor in chief of the Slate Group, the internet based arm of 
the Washington Post Company. 
 
19:03:42  
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Thank you John.  Eli, you can’t have Evgeny.  He’s committed to me till at least 8:15.  
Look, I’ll concede that the internet narrowing our political perspectives is an interesting 
theoretical problem.  People do have a tendency to prefer listening to what they already 
agree with. And the internet makes it easier in theory for people to live in a solid cystic 
bubble, where they mostly interact with people who have similar views.  But is that a 
phenomenon that’s getting worse?  And if it is getting worse, is it getting worse because 
of the internet?  Eli, and I think Siva, is going to argue that because, they think that 
because Google and Facebook are bad for us, it must be.  But their skepticism about 
these tools we use every day is kind of the mirror opposite of the cyber utopians who 
think that new technology only brings us good things.  There are a lot of interesting 
theoretical problems from the Malthusian food scarcity to the Y2K bug, that are just 
never born out in practice.   
 
19:04:46 
 
The Atlantic Magazine gets a cover out of this every month right?  Is Google making you 
stupid?  Is Facebook making you lonely?  That’s actually the cover this month.  Is Twitter 
destroying your attention span?  But cyber realists like Evgeny and me try to look at 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

questions like this in a more empirical way.  So what’s the evidence for tonight’s 
proposition, the internet is narrowing our views.  I won’t say there’s none, but I will say 
it’s laughably weak.  And there’s some really good evidence that the web’s doing the 
opposite of what our opponents claim, that it’s exposing us to a broader range of 
perspectives and making us less parochial in our outlook.  And it’s on that empirical 
basis and on the basis of your own experience of not becoming more narrow, that you 
should vote against tonight’s motion.  There’s of course some studies about this.  There 
was one a few years ago that showed left and right wing bloggers don’t just talk to their 
own side.   
 
19:05:40 
 
They respond to each other and link to each other a lot, and it’s not all the kind of 
exchange John cited at the beginning.  There's a Pew study from last year that show -- 
this is a quote, "No evidence that social network users, including those who use 
Facebook, were any more likely to cocoon themselves in social networks of like minded 
and similar people as some have feared."  There's another new Pew study that says that 
people's social network friendships tend to cross political boundaries.  The biggest study 
which involved 250 million Facebook users, yes, it was sponsored by Facebook, but it 
was a good study, showed convincingly that most people share links from people they 
aren't close to.  That is, we do reach outside of our personal circles for news.  So Eli said 
at the beginning of his very interesting book that he published last year, that "Google 
was tailoring search results to our politics."  He said that on the basis of one anecdote 
from a friend I don't think he named.  He had a similar anecdote tonight about Egypt.  
Allow me to be skeptical.   
 
19:06:42 
 
You can get -- you can do a funky search that gives you weird results at any time of the 
day for a variety of reasons.  But I did a test on this where I asked friends of mine, 
different parts of the country, different political views, different worlds, to search some 
parallel, very political loaded terms like "climate change."  And basically, they got 
exactly the same thing. And I don't think that there is more than anecdotes to support 
what Eli is talking about.  I've looked at the studies.  Now, since Eli wrote his book, 
Google has changed, and it now includes results from your social network and search 
returns.  So if you're spending all your time on Google Plus, and you're the only people 
in your circle or Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, you may in fact see some ideological 
bias in the returns.  But Google added social searching in a way that actually specifically 
addresses Eli's problem.  He had a lot of influence on this.  You can turn customization 
off by pressing the prominent button that says, "Hide personal results."  And you can 
toggle back and forth if you're curious about the difference.   
 
19:07:45

On Facebook, it's just as easy to turn off customization.  You change the sort option on 
your top stories to most recent.  In other words, the filtering they do, these giant sites, 
is completely transparent and optional.  I leave customization on most of the time 
because a social filter doesn't actually trap you in your own bubble.  And take music just 
as an example I think we can all relate to.  The reason I use Spotify, which is a social 
music service, is that I'm a little bored with the music I already know, and I want to be 
exposed to stuff I don't know, which I get through my Facebook friends.  So back at the 
level of theory, could an algorithm personalize the news to figure your -- your political 
perspective?  I think it's much harder to do that than it seems.  News organizations are 
really trying to do that. They actually haven't been very successful, which is why, when 
you go to newyorktimes.com, and I go, we get the same home page.  Of course, you can 
get narrow minded, politically filtered news, but you don't need the internet to do that.   
 
19:08:46 
 
You can go to Rush Limbaugh and the radio or FOX or MSNBC on TV.  Now, it is worth 
noting that we did used to have the kind of constricting filter bubble Eli's worried about.  
And that was the mainstream media before the internet.  When I was a kid in the '70s, 
you found out about the world through TV networks, a couple of news magazines, local 
newspapers. There weren't any national ones.  And it was a very limited range of 
viewpoints and voices. And if you want to create that kind of filter bubble, all you have 
to do is remove technologies before television, before radio, before newspapers.  So 
personally, I get a lot of my news these days through a tool called Twitter.  I use it as a 
filter for stories that are relevant to me.  And what it does is the opposite of narrowing 
my perspective.  Thanks to Twitter, I'm regularly getting news from global sources as 
well as American ones.  I tune into a lot of really interesting Arab voices during the Arab 
Spring.  I followed China in part through an English translation of Tweets from Ai Weiwei 
the Chinese artist who's become one of the most important dissidents in the world 
today.   
 
19:09:49 
 
And those filters broaden my perspective.  Twitter is a serendipity engine.  Finally, I 
don't think you need to look at all these studies or understand algorithms to make up 
your mind about tonight's motion.  All you have to do is ask yourself a pretty simple 
question:  Has the web narrowed my mind?  Has it made me less tolerant of people I 
disagree with and less interested in what they have today to say?  Or has it exposed me 
to a broader range of voices, sources and ideas than we all used to get when we relied 
on a consensus oriented mainstream media for all our information?  Unless you're 
convinced that the web makes you narrower, you should vote against tonight's motion.

Thank you, Jacob Weisberg.  A reminder of what's going on.  We are halfway through 
the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan.  We have 
four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion, "When it comes to 
politics, the internet is closing our minds."   
 
19:10:44 
 
We have heard the first opening statements, and now onto the third.  Debating for the 
motion, the author of "The Googlization of Everything and Why We Should Worry," 
chair of the University of Virginia's Department of Media Studies.  He's been called 
"Google's gadfly," Siva Vaidhyanathan. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
So the internet has so narrowed my mind that I didn't hear a word Jacob said. 
 
[laughter] 
 
So in these brief comments, I will explain what Eli and I mean by the internet as invoked 
in the resolution and what we mean by politics.  And I'm going to convince you to 
support the resolution.  First, try to remember 1999, the days of AOL, the days of 
Prodigy, the apex of our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity.  In 1999, 
Thomas Friedman wrote these words:  "the internet is going to be like a huge vise.  It's 
going to keep tightening and tightening that system” --meaning the system of 
globalization -- "around everyone in ways that will only make the world smaller, smaller 
and faster and faster."   
 
19:11:49 
 
Well, Thomas Friedman could not have been more wrong.  He's been exactly that wrong 
many times, but never more wrong. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Now, in 2012, it's clear that there is no such thing as "The Internet,” capital T, capital I as 
Friedman and others so often described in the 1990s.  There is no equalizing force, great 
democratizing force, there is no global network of networks that unites us all and gives 
us all equal voice to interact with each other across borders and across classes, for that 
matter.  In fact, the alleged network of networks is, in 2012, balkanized, nationalized, 
compromised, anesthetized, supervised, circumcised and hypnotized.  It's far from 
global, and it's getting less so every day.  The online experience of a person sitting in 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Turkey is so different from the online experience of someone sitting in India and so 
different from the online experience of someone sitting in Iran or someone sitting in 
China.   
 
19:12:48 
 
And all of those are even more different from the experiences of people in Brazil, in 
Russia or the United States.  And we're talking about more than censorship, although, in 
many of those countries, online censorship is a serious and crippling issue.  We're also 
talking about platforms, the platforms that people use, the platforms that governments 
will let people use. The rise of kill switches is something we have to take into account as 
well.  Kill switches that we saw a year ago in Egypt to wipe out internet communication 
in an instant, we've seen experiments in kill switches in China in early 2012, and we've 
seen people like Senator Lieberman even propose them in the United States.  Internet 
technologies amplify so much of what we already are and what we already want.  And 
the fact is, we're pretty provincial animals.  So add the internet to it, we just double 
down.   
 
19:13:44 
 
We get more provincial.  Platforms matter, defaults matter, and policies matter.  So 
here in 2012, or now in 2012, we are not all holding virtual hands with our Facebook 
friends across the globe singing, "We are the world."  There is no coordinated global 
movement for justice. There's no sophisticated online debate about our collective 
human state or even our basic human needs.  The dominant powers governing our 
digital experiences, the state, for instance, in China, or corporations in Brazil or the 
United States are not interested in such matters.  They are not interested in us being 
political.  Sometimes these powers actively restrict us, like in China.  More often than 
not, these powers seduce us into shallow consumption, consumptive behaviors like 
shopping or giggling at cats or clicking on cows. Not that there's anything wrong with 
clicking on virtual cows, but it ain't political.   
 
19:14:44 
 
Our minds are closing because our attentions are distracted, fractured and segregated 
into niches and nations.  But all hope is not lost.  There is nothing about the nature of 
the internet that prevents us from being political, richly political.  Many of us actually 
are, I would suspect that most of us in the audience have done a pretty good job of 
avoiding these traps. We're pretty elite.  We're pretty aware.  And we're pretty 
connected.  And we route around a lot of these problems.  We're also hungry for 
information.  If you weren't hungry, you wouldn't be here.  So many of us, despite what 
Facebook does with thoughts, despite what the Iranian government does in Iran, have 
managed to be richly political.  But we do know that the internet by itself does not 
topple dictators, does not undermine newspapers.  It's just not that simple.  If we 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 -

recognized the biases inherent in many of the platforms of our media systems, we can 
correct, we can adjust, we can invest, we can invent, we can resist, persist, and thrive.   
 
19:15:50 
 
We could build platforms that enhance Republican deliberation and extend 
cosmopolitan perspectives.  We just haven't done that yet.  We've been really busy 
clicking on cows.  But all that takes work.  It takes real human work in addition to 
invention and imagination, real human effort.  But the first step to recognizing that -- 
I'm sorry -- the first step to realizing that is to recognize what's happening.  When it 
comes to politics, the Internet, most importantly how we experience the Internet is 
closing our minds one cow click at a time. Please vote for the motion.  Thanks. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is, "When it comes to politics, the Internet is closing our minds."  And our 
final debater against the motion, he comes from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus, 
something that has shaped his interest in the Internet's role in politics, he is a Schwartz 
Fellow at the New American Foundation, and author of the book, "The Net Delusion," 
Evgeny Morozov. 
 
19:16:54  
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
Well, I'm glad that Siva has chosen to debate with Thomas Friedman rather than with 
us, but I'd like to begin with a few lessons from history.  First, technology always plays 
the scapegoat whenever it comes to debates about the closing of the American mind. 
Remember Allan Bloom and his bestselling book, "The Closing of the American Mind," in 
the '80s?  Well, let me remind you, Bloom has actually argued that the closing of the 
American mind occurs because of CD players and headphones.  And he actually argued 
that those might incite teenagers to kill their parents. We know what the late Allan 
Bloom would have made of the iPad, why his reactionary torch is now being carried by 
the liberal crowd from MoveOn is beyond me. 
 
19:17:47  
 
[laughter]

The second lesson from history is that concerns about online polarization are as old as 
the [unintelligible].  As early as 1995, the Nation Magazine carried an article by Andrew 
Shapiro, which argued, and I quote, "Cyberspace is shaping out to be more like suburbia 
than cy-Berkeley, where you interact only with people of your choosing and with 
information tailored to your desires."  That was 1995.  Six years later, Cass Sunstein 
argued that, "The Internet is serving as a breeding ground for extremism because 
likeminded people are deliberating with one another without hearing contrary views," 
end of quote.  So enter Eli Pariser.  In one respect, he follows in the tradition of Shapiro 
and Sunstein.  All of them present virtually no evidence that such online segregation is 
taking place.  But they're also different.   
 
19:18:41 
 
Where Shapiro and Sunstein worried that we, the users, might choose the easy way out 
and simply award our comfortable viewpoints, but Pariser argues that filters and 
algorithms are doing this for us.  It's a very important difference.  Shapiro and Sunstein 
blame the filter bubble on us, the users.  But Pariser blames it on the companies. Now, 
who doesn't like such an exciting conspiracy theory?  After all, it's always good to find 
someone else to blame but us.  I think this is a fairytale for many of the reasons that 
Jacob has outlined, but let me also provoke and give you three examples of how filters 
naturally enhance our political culture.  So let's take Twitter.  Many people think that 
Twitter, unlike Google and Facebook, does not engage in customizing and filtering. That 
is actually not true.  Twitter does hide certain types of messages.  Thus, if you follow me 
but you don't follow Siva, and I send Siva a public tweet, you will not see that tweet.  
Just think about it, you choose to follow me and you probably expect to get all of my 
messages, but you're actually not seeing my tweet to Siva.   
 
19:19:49 
 
And, mind you, Twitter made that filtering decision on your behalf.  Is it paternalistic?  
Sure. Are these types of paternalism justified?  Well, take my case.  I follow more than 
2,000 people on Twitter, and I'm very happy with the breadth of news I get.  But if I have 
to read every single conversation that these 2,000 people have with thousands of 
people that they know but I don't know, I will have never managed to follow 2,000 
people.  At best, I would follow 100.  This is the beauty of it, Twitter's [unintelligible] 
filter allows me to access more, not less useful information.  Now, let's take Facebook.  
It has 800 million users.  Some of them are heavy users, they have 5,000 friends and 
spend hours on it every day. Others open it every few weeks and only have a few dozen 
friends.  So Facebook has built this very collaborative differentiation.  If you are a heavy 
user, it presents you all updates from your friends in the chronological order. 
 
19:20:44 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

That’s the most recent updates from all your friends come first.  However, if you only 
use it occasionally, they will show you only the most interesting updates.  The 
assumption there is that if you have been away for three weeks and you only have 30 
minutes to catch up, why go through thousands of messages in chronological order?  To 
Facebook and to me, this seems like a reasonable assumption.  That’s why relevance 
rather than recency is the default filter for the occasional users.  If you want to see all 
the recent messages, all you have to do, as Jacob said, is just click a button called most 
recent.  Sure we can have a broad philosophical debate on whether social networking is 
good or evil, but as long as we accept that social networking is a legitimate activity, we 
should also accept that filters make it better.  Now let’s tackle the elephant in the room, 
which is Google.  Suppose I’m so keen on conspiracy theories that my blackboard is 
larger than Glenn Beck’s.   
 
19:21:45 
 
So I believe that 9/11 was an inside job.  I believe that Obama is a Kenya-born Muslim, 
that climate change is a non-issue manufactured by the lamestream media, that the 
government is hiding the truth about the UFOs and so on.  In other words, I’m exactly 
the kind of guy that Eli is worried about.  Furthermore, suppose that I became all of that 
before the filter bubble set in.  In the great age of unfiltered viewpoints that we used to 
call the era of cable television.  So now comes the filter bubble and Google starts 
personalizing my search results.  Instead of seeing generic search results say about 9/11, 
actually see that some search results have already been endorsed or liked by my friends.  
In turn, when my friends use Google, they see the links that I visited and I liked as well.  
Now this is the new mutual exposure, why is it a good thing?  Well if you think that all 
my friends are nut cases like me, then we do have a problem, because [unintelligible] 
exposure all of us may end up becoming even more paranoid.   
 
19:22:49 
 
But let’s leave Charlie Manson and the Unibomber aside for a moment.  I don’t think 
they’re representative of most internet users and their friends.  The way Google and 
Facebook map out our social connections, they try to be very comprehensive.  We see 
links from people we went to school with, our colleagues, our relatives, and so forth.  
It’s quite likely that many of these people will have radically different positions on 9/11, 
climate change, Obama’s birthplace, and UFOs.  So my point is this, that a link to the 
report of 9/11 commission that has been endorsed by someone from my social circle, is 
more trustworthy than a generic Google link that has not passed through a similar social 
filter.  In other words, it’s a possibility that people would now be paying more attention 
or at least more respect to positions they would otherwise find crazy and conspiratorial, 
only because their friends are known to endorse those positions.   
 
19:23:42

So, to conclude, there are many good concerns about the future of the Internet.   That 
of privacy ranks very high on my personal list, but the filter bubble is not one of them.  
It’s okay to hate Google and Facebook, but we should hate them for the right reasons.  
Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you Evgeny Morozov. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared US debate, where the motion 
being argued is, "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds."  Keep in 
mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening, because we’re going to ask you to 
vote again at the end and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be 
declared our winner.  Now we go on to round two.  Round two is where the debaters 
address each other directly and also answer questions from you in the audience and 
from me.  We have two teams of two, who are arguing over this motion, "When it 
comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds."  The side arguing for the motion, Eli 
Pariser and Siva Vaidhyanathan. They’re arguing that the internet is actually several 
internets, that they put up walls between the lands that are occupied by people of 
differing opinions, between nations as much as between liberals and conservatives.   
 
19:24:48 
 
And that especially with customization, designed to give us what we want, that the 
internet is getting worse at bringing together people who are not like minded.  The team 
arguing against the motion, Jacob Weisberg and Evgeny Morozov, they’re saying sure, 
maybe these bad things could happen someday but there’s not much evidence that they 
are happening a lot yet right now.  And besides a tool that can and does connect 
strangers globally around the world by definition, almost, is a good thing.  And that 
customization, perhaps helps to organize the way that we think.  So I want to put a 
question to the side that is arguing against the motion, that when it comes to politics, 
the internet is closing our minds.  Jacob Weisberg, you said as your sort of slam dunk 
point to the audience, you have to decide whether you think the audience is closing 
your mind.   
 
19:25:40 
 
But if the other guys are right, they won’t know whether the audience is closing their 
minds because if their minds are being closed, part of having their minds closed is not 
knowing that their minds are being closed.  I mean, but they're saying that it's an 
insidious thing, that it's a stealth thing, particularly with the customization, that it 
happens in a way that it comes to you -- you go through this process unawares.  Can you 
take that on?

Jacob Weisberg: 
Well, this is the minds in a vat -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Are you -- I'm sorry. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
This is the minds in a vat argument in philosophy, that if we were not actually 
embodied, but have our minds in vats being manipulated by space aliens, we have no 
way to know.  I'm not sure I can answer that.  But I do think -- Siva made this point that, 
well, for those of us in this room, this really isn't a problem.  I mean, we're media savvy.  
We're educated.  We're sophisticated.  It's a bit -- it's a problem for the hoi polloi out 
there, the unwashed masses who, you know, are just getting spoon fed whatever they 
get fed.   I find that argument condescending.  I mean, we live in a democracy, and it 
seems to me that we're all responsible for the information we receive.   
 
19:26:45 
 
And not everybody engages as deeply in different subjects.  But the difference with the 
internet is we can measure it.  You know, we never knew who read the stories in the B 
section of the New York Times about Albany and the state legislature.  On the internet, 
you know how many people click on them, but that doesn't mean -- 
 
John Donvan: 
It’s about 11, I think. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Yeah, exactly.  But how many people actually read to the end or even the beginning of 
the story before we had the internet? 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, Siva, take on, number one, Jacob's point that you're, I think, suggesting a little bit 
of snobbery here, that you're saying, we all can keep up with things, but that there's a 
great unwashed public out there that can be deceived by the power of these algorithms 
that are telling them what needs to show up in their searches. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
I merely meant that Jacob's test, whether it works for you, wasn't a good enough test, 
largely because you are just you, and you are not we.  You are not a greater sample, 
right?  
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

19:27:44 
 
So if we're going to be empirical, let's be good about the social science we deploy.  That 
is the worst possible empirical test, what happens to you.  It's almost laughable in its 
suggestion. So that can't possibly be the test when you address this question. 
 
John Donvan: 
But wasn't your partner using the "that's what happened to me when I typed in Egypt"? 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Let's talk a little bit about the studies about -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Eli Pariser. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
-- because I think it's worth digging into this a little bit.  There is one -- first off, the 
reason that it's so hard to study this stuff is because the easiest way to study it is to get 
inside the black box of these companies.  And these companies don't have any interest 
in letting people go in and prove that these companies are doing bad things.  But it's 
very hard to look at from the outside, which is why there's just not many studies that 
haven't been, as Jacob said, you know, funded by Facebook, funded by Microsoft, 
funded by the companies themselves.   
 
19:28:40 
 
The one clear study on Google personalization that has been peer reviewed is a study by 
a guy named Martin Feuz.  And it's pretty clear.  The methodology is good.  He looked at 
how a search history affects the personalization you get.  And it's very clear, again, 60 
percent of the search results on the first page are different for most -- for people who 
have a long web history in Google.  But actually, the study that's the most interesting 
here is the Gentzkow study that Jacob was referring to.  This is a study that was sort of 
initially described as a study that showed that people are linking to each other and that 
the internet isn't as polarizing as we thought.  And the interesting thing is that if you dig 
into that study, it actually arguably shows the exact opposite.  What they did was they 
created an isolation index for each different kind of medium.  And so the isolation index 
for cable news that that study used was about 3.3.  On the internet, the internet had a 7 
-- an isolation index of 7.   
 
19:29:47 
 
And so it's twice as polarizing as polarized as cable news.  Now, what's more interesting 
is that this was -- the study was done before the personalized internet.  So the main 
thing that that study was looking at was the fact that a lot of people, their online serving 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

patterns lead them to Yahoo! and then from Yahoo! out to a whole bunch of 
ideologically diverse links. But Yahoo!'s changed since 2007, since that study was 
written.  And so now, Yahoo! looks at your history on what links you've clicked at in the 
past and sends different people out in different directions. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me let the other side come in and take on -- 
 
Eli Pariser: 
One more [unintelligible], though. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, go ahead. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Which is that the other thing that's changed since that study was done is the rise of 
social media as one of the primary ways that people get information.  And they did this 
isolation index calculation on people's sets of friends as well.  So cable news is 3.3.   
 
19:30:41 
 
The internet in 2007 in the Yahoo! era was 7.  And people's groups of friends was 30.  
Now, that 30 has become embedded in every experience that we have on the internet 
now.  So you know, I think actually if you look into the studies that have been done -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, let's let -- 
 
Eli Pariser: 
-- it's quite clear -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's let Jacob Weisberg [unintelligible]. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
I read the same study.  It was a little baffling, but it said the polarization index for 
newspapers was 10.  So the old media is well beyond the mean.  I think you need to take 
all of that with a grain of salt.  I mean -- 
 
Eli Pariser: 
But you cited it.  I mean, this is the study that you were citing. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Right, exactly.  And it doesn't show that the internet is the most polarizing thing.  But 
there -- I looked at about half a dozen studies for this.  And I would have to say, just 
trying to be as objective as possible, that the preponderance, the studies I didn't cite, 
say that there's not clear evidence this is happening.  There's no evidence it's getting 
worse.  And I -- 
 
Eli Pariser: 
What do you think of the Feuz study?  Because we Tweeted about this. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
I don't think it showed what you're saying it showed. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's bring Evgeny in and -- 
 
19:31:42  
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
No, I just think, it's fine if we're talking about studies that no one but a few people in 
this audience have read, so they all sound [unintelligible].  But I think you also have to 
keep in mind that a lot depends on what kind of information you're trying to access 
online.  If you're searching for a piece on Manhattan and I'm searching it from my 
mobile phone, then Google knows where I am, I would actually want 99 percent of the 
searches also to be personalized, probably not 60.  Sixty is not high enough, in part 
because it's very obvious that what I want to do is to order a pizza.  Right?  So then if I 
am searching for political information, right, maybe the ratio should be 10 percent or 5 
percent or zero.  So to say that there is 60 percent of information that's personalized 
doesn't say much because it all depends on what it is that's being personalized.  Another 
point is that, again, take something like YouTube.  So if you don't sign in to YouTube, 
YouTube will show you at the very front page videos that are most popular with the rest 
of the crowd.  You see all those fascinating cat videos.  You will see all those videos from 
MTV.  You will see whatever is now popular in the online world.   
 
19:32:47 
 
They will all be displayed to you, and you will see them there prominently.  If I sign in 
with my Google account, with my search history, instead of cat videos, I'll see links to 
new exciting videos about history, about culture, about theater.  Why?  Because Google 
and YouTube know that those are the kind of videos that I like to watch.  So if Google 
can show me more videos about history than videos about cats, I can't really see how 
the internet is closing our minds. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Siva, are you arguing that the internet is closing our minds for your response.

Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Thank you, Evgeny, for making two of my points.  Number one -- that the notion of 
personalization, either through Facebook or another social network or through Google 
is actually tremendously helpful to us for shopping.  It's not so good for learning. When 
you want to learn -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
About cats. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
When you want to learn about anything complex, the worst thing you can do is subject 
yourself to a social filter.   
 
19:33:42 
 
The best thing you can do -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
You need better friends. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
-- is to challenge yourself -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- the best thing -- you're the person I retweet the most.  The best thing you can do, you 
need to get out of the bubble.  The best thing you can do is seek sources of expertise, 
seek sources that have -- that are particularly good at researching particular areas.  Use 
online sources that are focused in particular areas like health, like science, right?  That 
means call your librarian.  That means talk to an expert.  And that means go beyond 
asking a small set of people what the best way to explore a particular issue is.  But for 
pizza, not a bad idea. And we can talk later, because I'll tell you if you're still interested. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
[unintelligible] integrate 2,000 people that are following Twitter, one of whom is you, 
why not integrate those sources in my search results?  Why shouldn't I be able to see 
the searches of those highlights if no one is concerned about privacy?  Don't you think 
the links you share or click on are not smart or interesting for me? 
 
19:34:42  
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

They are for you.  That's why you're my buddy, right?  But that doesn't mean necessarily 
that what I'm doing is enhancing anybody else's -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
Why didn't you trust me to choose my friends and sources? 
 
John Donvan: 
Eli Pariser, I -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
You want to choose them for me? 
 
John Donvan: 
We also think your opponents who are arguing against the closing of American's minds 
through the internet have also made the argument that this personalization and 
customization, the filtering helps you think.  It helps you organize.  It cuts away the 
chafe.  It brings things down to a manageable amount of material.  And I can see the 
appeal to that argument.  So take that on, Eli Pariser. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Well, you don't hear me arguing that all personalization is bad or all filtering is bad.  
That's kind of a nonsensical argument.  As everyone has said, filtering has been around 
as long as there's information to filter.  But the question is, what are the filters -- what 
are the lenses through which we're looking at the world now doing for most people who 
are looking at the world through those lenses?   
 
19:35:43 
 
And I think we're talking a lot here about Twitter, but it's important to remember that 
Twitter -- actually it's hard to remember in a group of New Yorkers -- Twitter is a fringe 
phenomenon on the Internet relative to Google or Facebook.  Twitter has a tiny, tiny 
user base compared to these other -- sorry? 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Only 200 million. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Well, the -- but the actual -- the actual user -- you know, the active users, if you look at 
active users on Twitter, it's actually much smaller, it's about 25 million people, which is a 
lot of people, but not compared to Facebook, not compared to Google.  And so we have 
to look at sort of how most people are using this stuff.   
 
John Donvan: 
Yes, Jacob Weisberg.

Jacob Weisberg: 
I want to ask Eli one other question, I mean, since we're dealing with the interesting 
implications of this thing that I don't think is happening, how do you want to -- what 
kind of regulation do you want to deal with this problem?   
 
19:36:39 
 
Do you want to say that Google and Facebook aren't allowed to filter in certain ways, or 
do you want them to become this sort of paternalistic gatekeepers that say, "If you're 
searching for Lady Gaga video, you also have to have a little bit of this interesting study 
from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.” 
 
[laughter] 
 
Right?   
 
 
Eli Pariser: 
I'm not suggesting that we replace the old media paternalism with new paternalism.  I'm 
suggesting that, if we built these tools toward the purpose of helping people get good 
information, including a diversity of perspective, we could do that in a way that would 
draw on the Internet strength.  So I'll give you one example, Facebook, the main way 
that you propagate information across Facebook is with the Like button.  The Like 
button has a very particular valence.  It's easy to click Like on, "I baked a cake," it's hard 
to click Like on, "Massacre in Darfur continues for 11th year."  And so certain kinds of 
information propagate very readily.   
 
19:37:40 
 
Other kinds of information don't propagate at all.  Now, without instituting any kind of 
objective paternalism, this is more important than that, you could put an Important 
button on Facebook that'll allow people to elevate the topics that they believed were 
important as well as the topics that they think are fun and interesting and that they'd 
like their friends to see. So there are ways of doing this that are Internety, that don't 
require, you know, someone in a room making these value judgments but that actually 
lead toward filtering, that helps us seek -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
That still doesn't solve the filtering problem, come on, we'll still be as close minded if 
you buy into a paradigm with the Important button, it's just that now in addition to 
being close minded, three people in the audience will care about Darfur. 
 
Eli Pariser: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Well, it's better than none, but I think the interesting thing here that I kind of want to 
get to is -- I wanted to ask you about this, Evgeny, because you wrote a Slate piece 
recently in which closed with a call that was actually kind of more paternalistic than 
where I would go. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
True. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
You know, it closes by saying, "It's not unreasonable to think that the denialists of global 
warning or benefits of vaccination are online friends with other denialists.   
 
19:38:51 
 
As such, finding information that contradicts one's views would be even harder.  This is 
a reason for Google to atone for its sins and ensure that the subject dominated by 
pseudoscience and conspiracy theories are given a socially responsible curated 
treatment." So can you talk about -- I was just curious about that because I can't make it 
square with your position. 
 
John Donvan: 
Evgeny Morozov. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
No, I think it's very easy to make it square.  I mean, first of all, public health, particularly 
vaccination, I think it's different from political information.  Political information is 
contentious by default.  Vaccination related decisions are far more contentious because 
public health and often national security is at stake, so there is a difference there, first 
of all. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
So you think-- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
Second of all -- 
 
Eli Pariser: 
-- global warming isn't political? 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
-- second of all, it is less political than public health. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Really? 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Evgeny Morozov: 
Well, I mean, look, is anyone going to shut down the school or public square because of 
global warming tomorrow?   
 
19:39:42 
 
They will if there is an outbreak of an epidemic or some contagious disease.  Again, you 
have to understand that this is a very particular context in which I think warning people 
about certain types of websites, which has nothing to do with socialization, has 
everything to do with certain publishers publishing deliberately misleading information 
about vaccination, for example, or about the risks of flu vaccines or any other sort of 
vaccine, and I think it would not be a bad idea for Google to show that there are sites 
which have actually been approved through peer review and through normal scientific 
practice and -- to show that, "Hey, you actually have sites which you can trust."  I don't 
think it has much to do with filtering or the social layer. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
But when you say it's not unreasonable for denialists to be online friends with other 
denialists and as such finding information that contradicts one's views -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
We have freedom of association so it’s not unreasonable -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But let me bring in Siva, yeah. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Well, I would go to a less paternalistic position.   
 
19:40:42 
 
I don't think we should be in the business of telling Google what to do or telling 
Facebook what to do.  I think we should be in the business of building new platforms, 
new tools, new ways of relating to each other.  And having these conversations, I think 
everybody should read books about the subject, which is a pretty good way.  And then 
adjust your own behavior and have those ideas echo through your social networks, that 
perhaps it’s a good idea to break out of the filter bubble. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me ask the side that’s arguing that when it comes to politics, the internet is closing 
our minds.  For some concrete examples of this phenomenon that concerns you, 
actually having caused harm to the body politic, because there’s a little bit of an 
assumption, and maybe you’re not making this point, but there’s a little bit of this 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

assumption that all do need to be talking to each other and that there’s a middle that 
we’ll all reach in some kumbaya moment.  But in fact, what’s wrong with having people 
entrenched in their own camps, angry at each other?  As long as the political spectrum is 
covered overall, what’s wrong with that?  And what examples of harm can you talk 
about that have been caused by that. 
 
19:41:45  
 
Eli Pariser: 
Just a little story, when I was on the book tour for my book, I was on a radio show in St. 
Louis.  And the host decided to make this big spectacle of having people Google Barack 
Obama and call-in and read their search results.  It was a really boring radio hour.  And 
the first person called in, the second person called in and they interviewed everybody 
and had people kind of do a read-off where they’re both reading it off at the same time 
and it was exactly the same.  And I was thinking, this is the worse book promotion I’ve 
ever done.  And then a third guy called in, and he said you know it’s the damndest thing, 
when I Google Barack Obama, the first thing that comes up is this link to this site about 
how he’s not a natural citizen.  And the second link is also a link to a website about how 
he doesn’t have a birth certificate. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
That was your publicist. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Oh, I was wondering about that.   
 
19:42:41 
 
But so, I think the danger here is that it’s not just that he was getting a view of the world 
that was really far off the average here.  But he didn’t even know that that was the view 
that he was getting.  He had no idea how tilted that view was.  And that’s sort of the 
challenge.  I just want to address one other point, which is that there seems to be this 
question about whether this is happening.  And it’s really kind of funny to me, because if 
you talk to these companies and if you listen to what they’re saying, all of these 
companies are very clear that personalization is a big part of what they’re doing and 
what they're -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
For pizza, weighted decisions.  They are very clear.  And they say we don’t want to do it 
for politics, we only want to do it for pizza. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Right, and the question is, can you trust them? 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
Let me -- Jacob, I think Eli left a pretty good image hanging out there, of these folks truly 
not knowing how much they don’t know and believing what they’re getting and not 
understanding how slanted it is.   
 
19:43:43 
 
That landed pretty well I think, so can you respond to that? 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
But a guy who called into a radio show?  I know the plural of anecdote is data.  But I 
mean, if this were really happening in the way you say it is, wouldn’t there be some kind 
of decent study that actually showed widely varying results?  I mean as I say, I’ve tried 
to test this out as best I can.  I’ve tried it myself on various browsers, signed in, signed 
out, Wikipedia always comes up first, sometimes it comes up second.  Wikipedia’s 
vaccine entry is pretty good.  I do not think there is actually the kind of variety you’re 
talking in searches done most of the time by most people. 
 
John Donvan: 
Siva. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
So, doing social science online is really hard because almost nothing is replicable.  Right 
so almost any, even if you did a broader study than that, even if Eli did a broader study 
than that, the third person to do that study would not come up with the same results.   
 
19:44:41 
 
For the simple reason that both Facebook and Google are constantly changing their 
algorithms, constantly tweaking their algorithms for reasons we can’t possibly 
understand and are not allowed to understand.  It’s also important to remember that 
there are so many variables in what you get.  There are some searches that are more 
personalized than other searches.  Again, for reasons that Google understands and we 
are not allowed to understand.  There are some ways that you can generate different 
searches because there are certain keywords that matter more in certain geographic 
locations than others.  So a search for S-O-X in Boston or Chicago will yield a particularly 
strong result and personalized in those areas where as S-O-X searched somewhere else 
in the world might yield gibberish because it doesn’t mean anything.  So all of these 
variables, plus the big variable, whether or not you’re a Gmail user, whether or not 
you’re signed into YouTube, whether or not -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Are you agreeing with your opponent that you can’t make the case based 
[unintelligible]? 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
No, no, I’m, what I’m saying is that the empirical studies that have been done are 
limited in their utility.   
 
19:45:41 
 
What we do know is exactly what the companies say they do.  And they say, and they've 
said to Eli on a number of occasions, that they personalize our results.  And not that -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
You have just disbanded [spelled phonetically] the companies because I would actually 
prefer Google and Facebook to personalize my search results based on 500 factors 
rather than on just two factors. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
I'm not interested in -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
I don't want them to personalize my news or search results based on my sex and based 
on my race or based on how old they think I am.  I would like them to take a broader 
view and incorporate 300 factors, 500 factors if it's necessary, rather than -- 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Okay, but you don't get to say -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
[unintelligible] me into a social group to which I don't want to be known.  It's a good 
thing. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
I'm not interested in attacking or defending the companies.  I'm interested in explaining 
what's going on to the best of our ability.  And we are feeling around in the dark 
because all of this is in a black box, private data, and yet so deeply important to our 
public lives -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
That's how capitalism works.  They have trade secrets.  They will never disclose their 
algorithms -- 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
I know. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 -

Evgeny Morozov: 
-- because if they do, you're going to suffer. 
 
19:46:42  
 
John Donvan: 
Jacob Weisberg. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
I know.  And that's the problem. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
So why ask the impossible? 
 
John Donvan: 
Jacob Weisberg. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
I think there's another point here.  We're talking mainly about Google and about 
Facebook that have these kinds of personalization you can turn off.  Whether when 
they're turned on, they do what you say they're doing is a matter of some dispute.  But 
most people don't get their news from Google search.  And most people don't get their 
news from Facebook.  They get their news from the news.  Now, these are increasing 
sources of information of different kinds.  But have you used Google news?  It's not a 
great product, and it's not one of the top ways that people get their news.  People still 
get their news both from traditional news sources and from big online sources like CNN, 
Yahoo! news -- 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Which is personalized. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Yahoo! news is the AP.  If you go -- it's basically an AP news feed.  There is a social 
feature, similar to Facebook and Google.  You can turn off.  You can have it personalized 
or not personalized if you prefer. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
First of all, defaults matter.  The fact that you have to know to turn it off to turn it off is 
a huge issue.  There is a reason those social phenomena are on by default because it's in 
those company's interests to make sure that you do get personalized results. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
But that's in our interest.  I want it turned on.

19:47:51  
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
But you might not realize that it's happening unless you happen to -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
-- personalized option.  I mean, Siva, it's a chicken and egg problem.  You will not realize 
that you can personalize them otherwise.  And then I don't see this as an argument. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I'd like to go to audience questions at this point.  We're in the middle of round 
two. Our motion is, "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds."  
Microphones will be brought forward if you raise your hand.  Remember, about 30 
seconds is what you'll get.  You can state a quick premise, but please ask a question that 
keeps us on the topic of this motion, and we'll move along this debate.  And I really do 
mean it to be a question, not a -- not a debating point.  But we -- we did put out, on 
slate.com, who is our media partner, a request to them for questions from some of their 
subscribers.   
 
19:48:42 
 
And we also -- is Lenny Gengrinovich here?  Did you show up?  Yep, there he is.  All right.  
So Lenny took the initiative of sending a question into us by email.  So thank you for 
that.  And I'm going to actually -- you can ask the question yourself.  I just wanted you to 
actually make it drastically shorter. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Just one page. 
 
John Donvan: 
And if you want, I can paraphrase it or -- I'll go ahead and paraphrase it for you.  He 
basically makes this statement:  The tiny minority of democratic citizens who are 
interested in political ideas and issues cannot have a discussion.  They have freedom of 
speech, but there's nobody to speak to in the internet -- ersatz world of discussions 
which only hides the problem.  Do you agree that our nation needs affirmative action 
for intelligent conversation?  I'll put that to Siva first. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Most definitely, but we're doing it right now, right?  It means that we have to have 
foundations like the foundation that supports this discussion.

19:49:46 
 
It means that we have to have universities, and we have to have schools take these 
issues seriously.  And make sure that we are all able to understand the environments in 
which we operate, that we have to understand the nature of these platforms and 
technologies.  And when there is a suboptimal result, we have to know how to correct 
for it. And if we're not happy with it, to invent something new. 
 
John Donvan: 
On this side, do you want to respond, or do you agree?  Jacob Weisberg. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Well, I think, you know, the low quality of commenting is one of the big problems on the 
internet.  It's one we've been very concerned with, particularly -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Jacob, can you just come in a little closer? 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Oh, I'm sorry.  We've been very concerned about -- at Slate over the years with 
improving it. The big breakthrough, I have to say, came from Facebook, through a 
technology -- an interface known as Facebook connect, which basically brought identity-
based commenting to every website.  And it means that because people are themselves 
when they comment, they're actually a lot more reasonable, not necessarily reasonable 
all the time, but they don't engage in quite the level of viciousness and ad homonym 
attacks and just soft point arguing they do when they're anonymous.   
 
19:50:49 
 
So I think partly this say problem I'm optimistic about improving through technology. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let's go out to the audience now.  And right in the front row, right behind the 
clock. Again, if you can stand up and hold the mic close to your mouth.  Tell us your 
name, please. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Hi.  My name is Tal.  And there's two main points in the premise tonight, one that our 
minds are being closed, at least more so than any other time.  And two, that the 
internet is doing it. And I would like to ask the panel for the motion to address both of 
those issues. 
 
John Donvan: 
I think they have.  So unless you feel that you haven't covered that, I think that it's -- 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
I would only qualify it by saying -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
-- it's not as simple as doing.  It is that we are interacting with these platforms at such a 
high and intense level without realizing what's going on.   
 
19:51:44 
 
And that's what's happening.  So it's amplifying what we were already willing to do, 
which is gather among ourselves and reward ourselves with positive affirmation.  And 
that's really mostly what goes on on Facebook. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
Siva, but first you argue to govern among themselves, but then you argue that the 
internet is getting balkanized, and we are all in our own little niches.  I mean, how do 
you square it both of them. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Ourselves, that's one of the niches, right?  And it's being balkanized nationally which 
then reduces the global political -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
You aspire to this one global Utopia -- 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Very much. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
-- where people in China feel like people in India and Iran and elsewhere? 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Yeah, that would be really nice.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Eli Pariser: 
-- is, you know, there's a great book called "the big sort" about how increasingly people 
live in communities that are like them, in homogenous communities.  And one of the 
fascinating things about this book is that you have two things going on at the same time.  
 
19:52:41 
 
On the one hand, there is a broader set of types of communities than there was 30 
years ago, right?  That's undoubtedly true.  On the other hand, for each individual 
person in that system, their neighborhood is more like people like them than it ever was 
in the past.  And so you have local homogeneity and heterogeneity at the top level.  And 
I think when people are trying to make the opposite argument, they point to, hey, look 
at the internet, there's all this different stuff out there.  It's so heterogeneous.  
Everybody's talking.  But actually, the question is, what are people's local neighborhoods 
like?  And to the extent that we're now bringing those local neighborhoods with us 
online, what effect does that have in, you know, amplifying the homogeneity that 
increasingly surrounds us even when we're off line. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
I would encourage you to look at the recent issue of American Journal of Political 
Science which actually debunks, the big sort bulk with a load of empirical data and 
shows that even in the off line world, that this has never held true. 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you go up three steps, please, and turn right?   
 
19:53:45 
 
Ma'am?  Yeah, you're rising -- on your other side, sorry.  Just wait for the mic.  Thanks. 
 
Female Speaker: 
My name is [unintelligible].  And I'm curious about either the growth of your audiences 
or the decrease of your audiences and the quality and the quantity of discourse that's 
been created over the past let's say three years. 
 
John Donvan: 
So how would you relate that directly to the motion?  Are you asking whether they're 
seeing a closing of the minds in the interaction with their readers? 
 
Female Speaker: 
In their own personal -- in their own personal writing and their own personal blogs and 
the information that they're providing -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -

John Donvan: 
Are they seeing minds closing? 
 
Female Speaker: 
Are they seeing minds closed? 
 
John Donvan: 
Jacob Weisberg. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Well, I think I tried to answer -- I tried to speak to that in my introduction.  No.  I felt 
personally just the opposite.   
 
19:54:44 
 
I feel like I've never been in touch with a wider variety of viewpoints and people.  And a 
lot of that is through social media, because people act as filters for you.  When you find 
something that's somewhat interesting, whether they're a personal friend, whether 
they are someone in a field you're interested in, whether they're in another field or just 
someone you admire, they bring you a whole range of things, on Twitter, on Facebook.  
So no, my experience has been just the opposite. 
 
John Donvan: 
Siva? 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Well, I've written for Slate, so I've had a great experience.  But I -- my experience is 
narrow. My experience is my own, and my experience is based on the particular subjects 
that I cover, which happen to plug right into these questions, for the same reason that 
this is not a representative audience of internet users, my readers are not a 
representative audience of internet users. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
I just want to -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
So I think that the fear that somehow diversity online is shrinking.   
 
19:55:42 
 
I think my own case disproves that.  I mean, I have an unpronounceable name.  I was 
born in the middle of nowhere in Belarus, and the only reason why I actually have the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

attention and the audience I have is mostly because of the Internet, because of the 
Twitter stream I run and because of active writing for online publications and doing a lot 
of online research in Google Scholar.  So I would say that the fear that somehow it will 
become impossible for diverse voices from Iran or [unintelligible] or elsewhere to get 
heard -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
-- direct interaction with the public has indicated to you that -- am I right, ma'am, you're 
talking about -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
But, I mean, if I look at the public -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
[inaudible] quality of discourse.  I'm assuming that this debate is about whether 
discourse is closed, whether -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
My point of my own case shows that it's actually getting more diverse in terms of voices 
who never previously would have a chance to sit in an audience like this or participate in 
political debates but, you know, I participate in them. 
 
John Donvan: 
Eli Pariser. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
When I was at Move On, we tried a number of times to do these kinds of cross partisan 
conversations and have people sit down in a room together and talk.   
 
19:56:44 
 
And it is amazingly hard to do.  And, you know, I think it's probably always been hard.  I 
don't think that, that's a new phenomenon, but the degree to which people live in 
different universes of fact, not just different universes of opinion, in other words, the 
degree to which you can't even get to something to argue about because people won't 
even agree that, that's a thing, is, you know, really striking.  And I can't help but wonder 
as Evgeny has, as have many of us, if the way that the Internet is structured isn't 
amplifying that and helping people who believe, you know, pretty in my opinion, you

know, misinformation, like the Obama birth certificate stuff or that climate change is 
not something that's partly caused by people, is it amplified by that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Siva. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
I have a really quick answer.  I misunderstood your question.  I apologize.   
 
19:57:44 
 
Before five years ago, I didn't have such a thing as Facebook in which to engage in 
conversation with my friends.  I ran two blogs.  And both of them were maddening 
because every conversation I had was overwhelmed by harassing people, people who 
were merely there to disrupt the conversation, not there to engage in a reasonable and 
rational way.  We call them trolls.  And one of the reasons that I closed down my blogs is 
it was so maddening that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
As opposed to taking lithium. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Exactly, exactly.  The quality of discourse in the comments plus the spam was just out of 
control.  On Facebook it's a lot more comfortable, right?  It's a lot more pleasant.  It's 
because I never see people I disagree with.  It's really lovely now. 
 
John Donvan: 
I think I -- a lot of the questions that came in -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
You follow me on Twitter, though. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- a lot of the questions that came in through Slate are similarly focused on this question 
of the impact on the quality of the American political discourse and they -- Levi Osborne 
[spelled phonetically] in Warrensburg, Missouri, asks, "Is it so much the internet in itself 
that is closing our minds as it is the hyper partisanship of these commentators which so 
many people listen to?"   
 
19:59:01 
 
And by, "commentators," he's talking also not just about people who are online, but 
people who are also in television who are blogging, and people in newspapers who are 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

blogging, but he's talking about the blogging aspect of people with hyper partisan points 
of view, and -- Jacob Weisberg. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Well, I do think the phenomenon of increased polarization in Congress is pretty clearly 
documented at this point.  That's happening, and I deplore it.  I just don't think the 
Internet has anything to do with it.  I think the big drivers of that are redistricting which 
put people in districts that tend to go one way or the other and fewer that swing back 
and forth.  I think it's fundraising which means politicians spend all their time 
fundraising and actually don't have human relationships with each other very much.   
 
19:59:44 
 
I think hyper partisan media, of which Fox is probably the best example, have some 
impact on it.  But members of Congress, these are -- if you want to look for a group of 
people who really aren't on the Internet very much, that's them.  I mean, I don't think 
it's what's driving it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Siva. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
So part of the phenomenon of the punditocracy is indignation.  That's the currency.  And 
indignation is a subset of the attention economy.  In order to appear on CNN at 2:00 in 
the afternoon, in order to appear on Fox News at 7:00 p.m., you have to say something 
that angers somebody, either directly in their face, "I'm angering you as someone who 
disagrees with me," or more likely you gather people on your side to be angry.  And the 
notion that we are so addicted to something now we can measure, the click, the instant 
attention, the instant affirmation, just reinforces that, so it is a phenomenon that's 
actually moved from the blogosphere, and that's why we've seen so many people who 
got famous being bloggers now are appearing on CNN at 2 PM, now appearing on Fox at 
7 PM. 
 
20:00:51 
 
Right, that’s what’s happening.  It’s why MSNBC is filled with former bloggers.  It is 
because they’re already adept at generating indignation towards one side or another. 
 
John Donvan: 
And is this a mind closing exercise or this just meaningless entertainment? 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
I think the results are.

John Donvan: 
It does have an impact. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
But mind closing, yes. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
I think, just to take a step for the resolution. 
 
John Donvan: 
Eli Pariser. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
I don’t think anyone up here thinks that the primary thing driving American-- the very 
partisan spirit of American discourse is the internet.  The question is, is the way that 
most people use the internet helping or hurting?  That’s the question that you really 
have to answer.  Is the way that people are using the internet helping or hurting in this?  
And I think, it’s hard to argue, most people’s social networks are homogenous, that’s 
just true.  Most people do have social networks that are largely made up of people like 
them.   
 
20:01:43 
 
Now there are the outliers for sure.  But if you’re getting more from people who you 
know, you’re getting more of your news from people who are like you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, let’s go back to questions.  You’re wearing a lime green tie.  You’re looking at your 
tie.  Sorry, that was a terrible cue to give, you’ve got to look down. 
 
Male Speaker: 
My name is Andy, so I have a question about confirmation bias.  This is -- I really don’t 
know the answer, which is, do you think now, or before the internet, it was harder to 
avoid, whatever your ideology, information that would challenge your belief, be it the 
nightly news or an encyclopedia or the newspaper, whereas now, you mentioned 
Wikipedia.  But that might be, there might be an analogue to the encyclopedia of old, 
but now you could just go to Conservapedia and find out that wow, Paul Revere 
actually, the ride was consistent with what it was described as.  And so it’s a lot easier to 
find that information that’s going to confirm your biases and that would contribute to 
the closing of the mind. 
 
20:02:44  
 
John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

But Evgeny kind of addressed that point when he -- I think you said, Evgeny, earlier in 
your opening statements, that initially the theory was the internet gave us tools to do 
stuff that we were already doing.  But the other side is arguing that without our knowing 
it now, the internet is making us do that and we’re unaware of it.  So do you feel that 
your question was answered? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Well it was more the idea of seeking out information that is going to be feeding your 
own biases, whereas you’re not exposing yourself.  You’re not going to be exposed as 
much as you would before to stuff. 
 
John Donvan: 
But is it, how is it different from 30 years ago, that if you, you could go down to the 
library and take out all the crackpot books that you wanted to. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Well that’s the question. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Let’s let Jacob Weisburg take that one. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan used to always say, everyone’s entitled to their opinion but not 
their own facts.  And I think we all agree that in a democracy, you need an informational 
common to some extent, where people are arguing about what they think about reality, 
not about reality itself.   
 
20:03:44 
 
But I think Wikipedia’s a pretty great information commons.  And it is again, the first 
search return on almost everything, or at least one of the first few.  And Wikipedia has 
its issues and its problems but overall, Wikipedia strives to be neutral ground on an 
informational level.  That’s an anecdote, but I think it’s an important one.  I think the 
internet cuts both ways and in some ways, it can cut in favor of confirmation biases that 
you’re talking about, and in some ways it can cut right against it. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
I think we also -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Evgeny, let me let the other side come back to that, to Eli Pariser, is arguing the internet 
is closing our minds. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Eli Pariser: 
Well just to go from anecdote to the study.  One of the findings of the Pew study was 
that the more personalized Google search results, the further down Wikipedia was in 
the search results.  So if you have an empty search history, Wikipedia is the top result.  
But the larger your search history, the less Wikipedia comes up.   
 
20:04:50 
 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Eli Pariser: 
The more it’s replaced by -- so this was the best study that we have on Google 
personalization.  And it suggests, I agree -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
But do you see any logic, why would Google deliberately want to demote Wikipedia in 
search results? 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Totally, I see the logic.  
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
What’s the logic? 
 
Eli Pariser: 
I just think -- the logic, they have the means and the motives to provide the links that 
people will click on the most.  That’s not the means and the motive to provide the links 
that are the most useful to people. 
 
John Donvan: 
Because of that burst of pleasure that you talked about in people’s brains. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
But Evgeny, I just want to let him finish the point.  Is it because of that burst of pleasure 
principle that you talked about, that in fact, they’ve actually studied it.  And that we feel 
good and we stick around if we get results that we like. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Yeah I think that’s one of the --

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
You never got the chance to respond to that point. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
Google places no ads on Wikipedia.  Google doesn’t care what you click on; all they care 
is you stay on Google.   
 
20:05:42 
 
Right?  They don’t really care whether you go to Wikipedia or Conservapedia or 
somewhere else.  Right, and I think right now what Google actually wants to do is 
present the result right away without having to spend any time on it.  So, yeah, I just 
don't see the logic on which you're basing that decision.  But the response to the 
question you asked, I think you need -- we need to set realistic goals for ourselves.  We 
are not going to dissuade people who deliberately decide to go to Conservapedia 
instead of Wikipedia.  There is nothing policy-wide that we can do.  If people already 
decided to seek those very biased views.  There is little we can do.  I think we need not 
be Utopian.  We have to set realistic policy goals.  And from a public policy perspective, 
to figure out what we can do, change design, regulate Google, ask them to do 
something.  But to expect that Google suddenly can wave the magic wand and make 
sure that people stop going to FOX News.com or Conservapedia and start going to 
Wikipedia instead, I think it's an unrealistic goal that we shouldn't even set for 
ourselves. 
 
John Donvan: 
Siva. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Again, thank you for making our point.   
 
20:06:41 
 
That's basically what we're saying, that Google is in the business of making sure that if 
you are looking for a conservative opinion about something, you're going to get more 
conservative opinions about things.  I'm sorry.  If you've expressed a desire to click on 
conservative things, you're going to get more conservative things. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
It is -- 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
And we don't expect Google not to magically --

[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Evgeny, hold, let him -- let Siva finish, and you can come back. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Don't expect Google to change magically.  We don't ask Google to change magically.  
What we ask is -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
It doesn't do anything, what you are saying. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
What we ask is that we pay attention closely to what Google itself says about what it 
does as is well documented, and we pay attention to the totality of our information 
ecosystem and the strong role that Google plays in that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Evgeny Morozov. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
It's all fine if you're paying attention.  I'm all for paying attention to Google.  It's just that 
Google itself goes on the record saying that they do not want to personalize politics.  All 
they want to do is personalize pizza.   
 
20:07:40 
 
I think from a business perspective, I see no reason why Google would want to serve 
you biased search results and show Conservapedia before Wikipedia. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
If you can produce a study that will prove that -- 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
It does so mathematically, not politically. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
-- it's a vast [unintelligible] for Google. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

It does so mathematically, not politically.  It doesn't distinguish between a political site 
and a pizza site because it doesn't do that. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
-- search for GOP, it knows you're searching for GOP and not pizza.  It doesn't -- 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
It doesn't read what GOP is, it associates it with all the other GOP clicks.  It doesn't flag it 
as political.  It just associates it mathematically with all the other behavior going on on 
the web. 
 
John Donvan: 
So GOP could be pepperoni as far as the algorithm is concerned. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Grand ol' pepperoni, yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I want to remind you we're in the question and answer section of this 
Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan, your moderator.  We have four 
debaters, two teams of two debating this motion: "When it comes to politics, the 
internet is closing our minds."  And, sir, right in the center there.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I 
meant a few rows back.  I'll try to come back to you.  My apologies.  That was an 
ambiguous signal.  And I didn't mean you, either, but -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
I'm -- you got the mic.  You win. 
 
20:08:49  
 
Male Speaker: 
Hi.  My name is John.  So I don't really hear anyone saying that information moving 
quickly and lots of information is closing our minds.  I hear not the internet but internet 
companies or even personalization is closing our minds.  So my question for the team 
arguing for the motion is, would something that wasn't corporate, like a public search 
engine alternative to Google that's nonprofit and not commercial solve some of the 
problems?  And then my question for the against the motion team would be, would you 
be opposed to something like that as a policy decision because you love personalization 
so much? 
 
John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 45 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And I'm assuming that this publicly -- this public service search engine would not be 
doing personalization. 
 
20:09:40  
 
Male Speaker: 
Well, perhaps it -- I mean, there could be a social aspect like, town halls. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  All right. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Sort of public spaces -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
That's a really intriguing possibility of a public search facility or public search engine or 
some sort of non-corporate entity that would help us guide us in certain issues, right?  
That's a nice idea, and I think it's worth pursuing and experimenting.  I'm not willing to 
predict the results.  I think the important thing is that we try everything.  The important 
thing is that we let a few things fail, and we try to learn from our mistakes.  But we do so 
openly. We do so deliberately.  And we don't sign away so many important things to a 
black box. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jacob Weisberg, your point. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
I was going to say that the Google skeptics -- have you tried Bing?  There are alternative 
search engines.  But I think -- I don't think it's something the government needs to do.  I 
think the idea of a nonprofit search engine is not a bad one, but I don't think it would 
fail to do personalization because I think a search engine that wasn't capable of 
personalization would be tremendously ineffective and disappointing.   
 
20:10:51 
 
And nobody would use it.  If it didn't know where you were, if it didn't gather any 
information about what kinds of things you were interested in.  I do think -- 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
I don't disagree.  I was just talking about transparency. 
 
John Donvan:

I want to go to another question, but I want to -- I want to confess that I would love to 
hear a female voice or two more in the mix tonight.  And I -- I may be -- suddenly every 
hand went down.  All right.  I tried.  Sir.  Oh, right here?  I'm sorry.  I didn't see you. Let 
the mic come.  Stand up.  Let us know your name and justify my choosing you. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Hi.  I was recently reading an article by Ethan Zimmerman, I think it was. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Zuckerman. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Okay, I'm seeing nods, yes.  And suppose you don't know.  It's an article about a theory 
known as cute cat theory, which is basically they applied it to the Arab Spring and saying 
that all of these movements, people that might want to watch cute cat videos, that's the 
majority of the people on the internet.   
 
20:11:54 
 
That's what they use it for.  There is a small majority who use it for internet activism.  
Now, a site like YouTube that uses the majority of people want to watch cute cat videos, 
but it also posts things like -- like -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I need you to target in on a question. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Okay.  Anyway, as far as maybe you guys can explain the cute cat theory a little better 
than I can.  But cute cat theory, I'm interested to know -- I think that the cute cat theory 
opens up the possibility for neighbors, when the websites get shut down to talk about 
political issues.  So for those of you arguing against the motion, I would be interested to 
hear your thoughts. 
 
John Donvan: 
For -- for the people who have to edit this for television -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
Yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Could you just restate the question and --

Female Speaker: 
I'm sorry. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no.  I think this is actually a great question.  And I like the idea that they'll tell you 
what cute cat theory is.  But if you could ask them about cute cat theory. 
 
Female Speaker: 
No, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm a little nervous [unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sure.  Go ahead. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Okay.  My question basically is about cute cat theory and whether those who watch cute 
cat videos, when a site like YouTube gets shut down, if they -- they're more likely to then 
go find out why YouTube got shut down, thus turning them into internet activists. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Eli Pariser, tell us what cute cat theory is and whether it's relevant. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
I'm not -- I don't feel well versed in cute cat theory, unfortunately. 
 
John Donvan: 
Who's good on the cats?   
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
Siva actually got tenure for his work on cute cat theory. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Eli Pariser: 
If I understand the -- I think this is a question about whether people will rally to support 
these online media that they depend on when they're under threat. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
So it basically throws my cats are the opiate of the masses theory.   
 
20:13:41 
 
You get home, you watch videos of cats.  Internet gets shut down.  You go and 
overthrow Mubarak.  If you think it's a good theory, good luck.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
We actually know that there -- it's really hard to watch YouTube in China right now.  And 
for a while, it wasn't so hard.  First of all, YouTube comes over really slowly in the 
people's republic because its servers are hosted in North America.  Google knows not to 
put the servers in China.  That would be bad news.  During the Tibetan uprising three 
years ago, YouTube basically went dark.  During the Olympics, it went dark.  And it's 
been intermittent since.  And nobody has banged on the doors of the Chinese 
government saying, "I want my YouTube."  They're busy with their own video services.  
They're busy with their own business.  They're busy clicking on their own issues, right?  
So it doesn't necessarily follow in that example.  The other thing to remember, when 
talking about the Arab Spring, going to a different part of the world, is that only 30 
percent of the Egyptian population was online at the time.  And then 11 days into the 
protest, zero percent were.   
 
20:14:44 
 
SMS was a much more important media form for doing anything.  And Al Jazeera was 
probably the most important media forum for informing people.  So what happened in 
North Africa had very little to do with cats, cute or otherwise. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Ma'am, right down in the front.  In the third row, sorry.  Right behind you, sir. 
 
Female Speaker: 
You guys have talked a lot about -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you tell us your name, please? 
 
Female Speaker: 
Debbie.  You guys talked a lot about personalization of the internet and why that's bad.  
But I'm asking those who are for the motion, what about people who go and seek out 
information in terms of wanting to comment on articles and videos that are against their 
own beliefs? 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Yes --

Again, it's not that it's impossible or even that hard to find information that you disagree 
with online.  There's a great cartoon that someone's staying up late at night and person 
tries to get them to come to bed, and they say, but someone on the internet is wrong.   
 
20:15:49 
 
That's like the experience that a lot of us have a lot of the time, but the question is 
whether the daily routines that we move through online will tend to bring us into 
contact more with people who make us feel that way or more with people who actually 
validate who we feel.  And as social networking becomes a bigger phenomenon, and I 
think in specific Facebook, let’s separate Facebook from Twitter, it's easier than ever to 
surround yourself with people who mostly agree with you, that's who your friends are. 
Now, just to address Twitter in particular, like I agree with these guys that Twitter is like 
a pretty good medium for filtering the Internet and I use it to -- I follow Karl Rove on 
Twitter and I get Karl Rove's tweets and it's great.  And, you know, I also follow him on 
Facebook, and I never see his Facebook posts because Facebook actually does a lot 
more personalization than Twitter does.   
 
20:16:49 
 
Now, you know -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Is that a relief to you or -- 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Yes, it -- well, Twitter's a relief -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Do you want more Karl Rove? 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Twitter's great, but Twitter's not how most people use the Internet. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no, I mean, the -- I mean, the lack of Karl Rove's presence in your Facebook feed, do 
you want more? 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
The fact that he writes boring messages on Facebook and Facebook doesn't find them 
interesting doesn't necessarily mean that personalization is so bad.   
 
Jacob Weisberg:

But there are a lot of caveats where you can say, "Oh, well, Twitter's great, but it doesn't 
count because it's not big enough."  I mean, just to go back to the numbers a minute, 
Twitter claims either, their numbers, 200 -- more than 200 million registered users, 
more than 100 million active users.  Facebook claims 800 million registered users, 400 
million active users.  I actually think Facebook's definition of an active user is much more 
generous to itself than Twitter, so maybe it is four times users, but, I mean, it's not 
insignificant.   
 
Eli Pariser: 
Americans spend seven hours a month on Facebook.   
 
20:17:41 
 
They spend minutes on Twitter, like that's just -- you know, if you look at the comScore 
numbers, if you look at -- I mean, it's just nowhere near as powerful a medium. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
As I said, people who use Facebook frequently, all see all most recent messages.  There 
is no personalization.  If you use it not seven hours a day but just one day a month, then 
-there is personalization. 
 
And then there is no justification for you to see every single Karl Rove message because 
you only have 30 minutes and you have 5,000 friends and you have one hour a month to 
spend on it.  There is no way for you to do it except for personalization. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
Right, no, I agree with that.  I'm just saying that a fact of that personalization -- 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
So for seven -- for people who spend seven hours on Facebook every day, there is no 
personalization. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
No, that's not correct. 
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
There is no personalization whatsoever.

Evgeny's right about that. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
No, it's not true.  There's -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, we're at an impasse.  And that ends round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. 
debate -- 
 
[applause] 
 
-- where our motion is, "When it comes to politics, the Internet is closing our minds."   
 
20:18:47 
 
And here's where we are, we are about to hear closing statements from each debater.  
They will be two minutes each.  Remember how you voted before the debate because 
this is their last chance to persuade you that they've presented the better argument.  
And you'll be asked once again to vote and to pick the winner in just a few minutes.  On 
to round three, closing statements from each debater in turn.  Our motion is, "When it 
comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds."  And here to summarize his position 
against the motion, Jacob Weisberg, chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group. 
 
Jacob Weisberg: 
I did like one suggestion Eli made which is that there should be buttons other than “like” 
on Facebook.  There should be a, "I'm not buying it," button, and I would have been 
clicking that the whole time I was hearing this argument.  
 
[laughter] 
 
The Internet doesn't change human nature, it just creates new opportunities for us.  
And if your view of human nature is that people are naturally inclined to be ignorant and 
bigoted and extreme, you're going to focus on the way the web lets them become even 
narrower and more close minded.   
 
20:19:47 
 
But if that's your view of things, your problem isn't with the web, it's with democracy, 
because people like that aren't going to do a very good job of governing themselves.  If 
on the other hand you think people are capable of informing and governing themselves, 
you have to appreciate the way that the web, which is the greatest trove of open 
information that the world has ever known, empowers us and broadens our political

perspective.  Evgeny and I have talked about some of those ways tonight, and I think 
Siva and Eli have talked about a theoretical problem that just hasn't been supported by 
the evidence or borne out. Does anyone here actually think that our political system 
would be better off without the web's democratization of information and the 
multiplicity of voices, if Tim Berners-Lee had never invented the world wide web, do you 
think we'd be better off if the web or Google or Facebook and Twitter or blogs were 
somehow magically taken away or regulated in some paternalistic way?   
 
20:20:40 
 
And I want to ask you again to think about your personal experience because it may not 
be an academic study but collectively it's meaningful.  Do you think the internet is 
making you more narrow or is it exposing you to ideas, people, and arguments, and 
points of view that you wouldn’t have access to without it?  In closing I just want to say 
that the idea that you and I would be less narrow in our politics without the web, isn’t 
just wrong, it’s actually preposterous.  And that’s why you have to vote against tonight’s 
motion. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you Jacob Weisberg.  
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "When it comes to politics the internet is closing our minds" and here to 
summarize his position for the motion, Eli Pariser, MoveOn.org, board member and 
author of the Filter Bubble. 
 
Eli Pariser: 
So I want to read you a quote from two Stanford researchers from 1997. They said, "We 
expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the 
advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.  We believe that the issue of 
advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it’s crucial to have a competitive search 
engine that is transparent and in the academic realm."   
 
20:21:47 
 
Now, the two researchers were Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and this was just months 
before they launched Google as a for-profit entity.  I think that version of them was 
right.  I think that the companies that increasingly control where and how we put 
information online have mixed motives.  And the motives that they use in creating these 
filters may not be, and in fact aren’t in our best interests.  They’re more likely to 
surround us with voices that tell us that we’re great and we’re right and we’re good 
enough and strong enough.  And they’re less likely to confront us with the places where 
we’re wrong.  What’s been interesting for me since writing the book is that I’ve actually 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 53 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

been invited to come talk with engineers at all of these companies, Amazon, Apple, 
Google, YouTube, and Facebook.  I’ve had conversations with people in each of those 
places.  And it’s sort of funny for me to hear people try to suggest that it isn’t a big part 
of what these companies are trying to do.  The engineers know that it is.   
 
20:22:44 
 
They wrestle with it every day.  They wrestle with the mixed motives, with these 
questions of how they should be building these platforms.  And they know as one Netflix 
vice president told me, that they can easily end up trapping people in these bubbles 
where they tend to believe the same thing.  So if you believe that the companies whose 
algorithms decide what we pay attention to, will tend to expose us to a broad diverse 
set of sources, you should vote with them.  But if you agree with me that we should 
scrutinize that, and that these commercial interests will tend to use that power to 
placate people rather than exposing them to more broad senses of view, then you 
should vote that the internet has in fact, unfortunately, been closing our minds. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you Eli Pariser. 
 
[applause] 
 
This is our motion.  "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds."  And 
here to summarize his position against the motion, Evgeny Morozov, author of The Net 
Delusion, visiting scholar at Stanford and Schwartz Fellow at the New America 
Foundation. 
 
20:23:45  
 
Evgeny Morozov: 
Well I wish that Don Draper had a chance to respond to that 1997 paper from Google. 
Again, you may think that advertising is evil, but again, advertising is the kind of evil 
that’s also inevitable.  So Eli has mostly avoided the what’s to be done question.  In his 
book, he actually is much more I think straightforward.  And he does want Google and 
Facebook to intervene and to expose us to more diverse information.  More diverse 
information diet even, that you are normally up for.  This second attempt is an utopian 
dream that is not realizable in practice.  Do we really want Facebook and Google to start 
nudging us to pay more attention to Joseph Kony in Uganda when we are searching for 
information about our local city council?  Okay, but then why pay more attention to 
Joseph Kony and say not climate change, or Syria?  Who will adjudicate here?  Do we 
really think that Silicon Valley is capable of this?  Do we really think Silicon Valley should 
be in this business?

Again, you have to think about the proposed solution.  Often they’re worse than the 
cure. Don’t forget, that in 1995, in that article in The Nation, Andrew Shapiro proposed 
that the government should re-nationalize the internet, to bring it back to avoid all that 
advertising evil that you’ve just alluded to.  Cass Sunstein in his book, wanted to force, 
by government, bloggers to link to their ideological opponents.  He wanted them, 
conservatives to link to liberals, and liberals to link to conservatives.  All of those ideas 
now seem very ridiculous. And that’s what I think we will think about the idea that 
Google and Facebook should be in the business of actually preserving us and presenting 
us with a more diverse information diet.  Information is not like food.  Politics is not like 
food.  Diversity here is a very political matter that will not be settled very easily.  
Ideological conflict here is inevitable and I think this is why you should vote against this 
proposition.   
 
20:25:42 
 
The sooner we do it, the sooner we can start attacking more important threats like 
privacy. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you Evgeny Morozov. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds."  And here to 
summarize his position for the motion, Siva Vaidhyanathan, chair of the University of 
Virginia's department of media studies and author of the Googlization of everything. 
 
Siva Vaidhyanathan: 
Evgeny has just done a great job to convince me that there is no virtue in the arguments 
made by people who are not me and not Eli and not made during this debate.  We have 
not advocated a government takeover of anything.  We have not advocated any Cass 
Sunstein-type intervention.  We merely want you to be aware of the problem and 
correct for it.  Jacob said, what if we had a world without the web?  What if we had the 
world without the web? We might get there.  Let me tell you why, because Facebook 
and Google and Microsoft and Apple all wish to be the operating systems of our lives.  
They're explicit about this.   
 
20:26:40 
 
They don't just want to be on the web because the web is 20 years old, and it's actually 
kind of creaky.  What they want to do is be there with you all the time in your glasses, in 
your pocket, in your purse and on your mind always.  They want to be your personal 
assistant. There's quote after quote after quote from every CEO of every one of these 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 55 -

companies that that's what they want.  And it might make things really cool for us.  But 
it's not going to make things rich and diverse.  It's not going to be the wonderful 
conversation that we could have had on the web if we hadn't instigated these gated 
communities, these operating systems of our lives.  We're on the way to having a 
Balkanized world and a Balkanized society because of these gated communities.  The 
fact is, nothing is determined here.  We can decide that we like what the web was 
supposed to be.  We can opt out of certain of these practices.  We should encourage 
diversity, encourage other platforms.  We should encourage experimentation.  We 
should recognize that Facebook and Google and Yahoo! and Bing and Apple and 
Microsoft are designed to gratify us immediately.   
 
20:27:49 
 
And that's great for pizza, but it's not for politics.  Thank you very much.  Please vote for 
the resolution. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  And that concludes our closing statements.  And now it is time to learn 
which side you believe has argued best.  We're going to ask you again to go to those key 
pads at your seat that will register your vote on which side you feel presented the 
stronger argument tonight.  And we will get the readout pretty much immediately.  
Press one if you support the motion that when it comes to politics, the internet is 
closing our minds.  Press number two if you are against this motion.  And press number 
three if you remain or became undecided. And you can correct your vote if you think 
you pressed the wrong button, and it will be locked in right away.  And we'll have the 
results in about 90 seconds.  So first, I want to ask -- I want to ask for a round of 
applause for our debaters, for the quality of -- 
 
[applause] 
 
-- of the arguments that they brought here tonight.   
 
20:28:48 
 
It was witty, and it was informative, and it went places.  Thank you very much to them. 
Thank you also to everyone in the audience who had the guts to stand up and ask a 
question and to all the people who I didn't get to answer -- to ask questions, I wasn't 
able to allow to ask questions, thank you, very much for your contribution to those as 
well.  So going forward, I just want to let you know that our next debate is in May.  It's 
our last debate of the season.  And our motion comes down to three words, "Ban 
college football."  And we had actually set this debate up quite a while back.  It has -- it 
was not in relation to the Penn State scandal.  It was actually motivated more by 
reporting that was done about the business side of college football and the sometimes 
harsh nature of the sport on the bodies of the athletes who play it.  So our debaters will

include somebody who wrote one of those articles, Malcolm Gladwell, who is author of 
"The Tipping Point," and "Blink," and he will be on the panel arguing for the motion.   
 
20:29:50 
 
And he wrote the piece in the New Yorker in which he compares college football to dog 
fighting.  His partner will be Buzz Bissinger.  He is the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist 
and author of Friday Night Lights.  That served as the inspiration for a movie of the same 
name and a critically acclaimed television series also of the same name.  Opposing 
them, we have a football player, Tim Green.  He is the former Atlanta falcons NFL 
defensive end, and Syracuse University all American.  He was inducted into the college 
football hall of fame in 2002.  And his partner also debating against the motion, Jason 
Whitlock.  He is Foxsports.com’s national columnist, and he's already as an offensive 
tackle at Ball State University.  So that's our last debate.  That's on May 17th.  And we 
would love to see you there.  Also we're trying something new tonight after the debate.  
Any of you want to join us, we are partnering with the New American Tavern to host a 
post debate reception that will be upstairs at Amity Hall.   
 
20:30:48 
 
That's a block away from here on Third Street between Thompson and Sullivan.  Details 
are in the programs that you have.  But our idea was that we noticed a lot of times 
people walk out of here still kind of energized and revisiting the issues and debating 
among yourselves.  We wanted to give you a place to do it and get together.  And to 
share your ideas across the partisan divide.  So that'll be at Amity Hall, $5 beer and well 
drinks.  And I will be there for a bit as well along with other members of the Intelligence 
Squared staff.  And finally, you are encouraged to Tweet about this debate.  Our Twitter 
handle is @IQ2US.  And the hash tag is IQ2US.  So we'll just wait about -- it's ready 
already.  Thank you.  All right.  So the results are all in.  Our motion is this: "When it 
comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds."  You have heard the arguments for 
and against over the course of this debate.  We ask you to vote before and again 
afterwards where you stand on this and how persuasive the teams were.   
 
20:31:49 
 
Here are the results.  Before the debate, 28 percent voted for the motion. 37 percent 
against and 35 percent were undecided.  After the debate, 53 percent are for the 
motion. That is up 25 percent. 
 
[applause]  
 
36 percent are against it.  That is down 1 percent.  We have 11 percent undecided.  The 
motion, when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds has carried.  Our
