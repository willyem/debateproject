John Donvan: 
We're delighted to have you taking part in this -- what for us is a special series, the fact that we 
have the word, "constitutional," in the motion is very relevant.   
 
And I want to now bring to the stage Nick Rosenkranz, who is at -- a professor at Georgetown 
University, and with Intelligence Squared U.S. as well, to talk about how -- why it is we're 
framing the debate this way and what this series is all about.  So let's please welcome to the 
stage Nicholas Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
So as I just told the audience, the constitutionality of this issue is critical.  It's why the word is in 
the motion, which to be -- clarify, that means we're not doing what tonight? 
 
Nicholas Rosenkranz: 
Yes, so we have a series of public policy debates, "Do you think X is a good idea or a bad idea?"  
This is emphatically not that debate.  This is about whether this is constitutional or 
unconstitutional quite regardless of whether you think this is a good idea or a bad idea.  So this 
is --

18:47:27 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, can you just bring the mic a little closer? 
 
Nicholas Rosenkranz: 
-- so this is very much not a debate about your thoughts on a particular military action or on 
Obama in particular; this is about constitutionality.  Consider, you know, a vote for Obama here 
tonight is -- it might implicitly be a vote for George W. Bush of yesterday or Ted Cruz of 
tomorrow.  This is not a vote about this president or this policy; it's about constitutionality. 
 
John Donvan: 
And, Nick, you are the law professor, so give us a little glossary about -- you know, take us for a 
minute to the text of the Constitution, and give us a little sense of what language is actually 
there. 
 
Nicholas Rosenkranz: 
Yeah, so the Constitution quite deliberately divides up war powers and gives some war powers 
to the Congress in Article I -- I see that you have got in on the screen here -- and some war 
powers to the president in Article II.  So most importantly the president -- Congress is given the 
power to declare war, but on the other hand the president is given the commander in chief 
power.   
 
18:48:28 
 
And so this debate is largely about where the line is between those two clauses: what the 
significance is of Congress's power, what's the significance of the president's power, and how 
these clauses fit together. 
 
John Donvan: 
And it would seem obvious, "declare war," what that means, but obviously this is tangled.  So 
what is it about the reality of the world we live in that makes this a constitutionally tangled 
question? 
 
Nicholas Rosenkranz: 
So oddly, interestingly, the Congress has not declared war since World War II, so that was the 
last time -- that one was clearly a war.  That was clearly a war, right?  But since then we've got 
all sorts of military actions that are, you know, I guess you could say, "quasi-wars."  They're 
police actions or we're hunting terrorists or we're acting in self-defense.  They don't exactly 
look like armies marching into battle on a particular battlefield.  They're much more ambiguous 
than that, and so that's -- how do these clauses apply to this more fluid, more modern use of 
our military?

John Donvan: 
So and that is why there is a constitutional debate. 
 
Nicholas Rosenkranz: 
That's it, exactly. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, well, we'll look forward to it.  Thanks, very much, Nick Rosenkranz.  Let's bring our 
debaters to the stage. 
 
[applause] 
 
A welcoming round of applause. 
 
[applause] 
 
Everybody settled?  Terrific.  I want to -- again, to kick off our broadcast, ask for one more of 
those special rounds of applause that you're doing so well already. 
 
[applause] 
 
In its two centuries-plus of existence, the U.S. has committed troops to conflicts overseas at 
least 182 times and counting.   
 
18:50:27 
 
Congress has declared war 11 of those times, and not since Pearl Harbor, and certainly not 
during the administration of Barack Obama, who has initiated drone attacks in Pakistan and 
Yemen, bombing runs in Libya, air strikes on ISIS, with his administration taking the position 
that he does not require a declaration of war, or really, even any sort of new permission from 
Congress.  So, is he right?  Well, that sounds like the makings of a debate.  So, let's have it.  Yes 
or no to this statement: The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging 
War Without Congressional Authorization, a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John 
Donvan.  We are at the Miller Theatre at Columbia University.  We're in partnership with the 
Richard Paul Richman Center and the National Constitution Center.  We have four superbly 
qualified debaters -- two against two -- who will argue for and against this motion: The 
President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional 
Authorization.

As always, our debate will go in three rounds, and then our live audience here at the Miller

motion, again: The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War 
Without Congressional Authorization.  Let's meet the team first arguing for the motion.  
Welcome, ladies and gentleman, Gene Healy.  
 
[applause]  
 
Gene, you are vice president of the Cato Institute.  You research there executive power and the 
role of the presidency.  Right on target.  You have said in the past that our presidential 
candidates talk as if they are running for guardian angel, shaman, and supreme warlord of the 
earth.  And we like it.  We got what we deserved, you said.  But I want to ask, though, have we 
had any elected officials who are non-supreme warlords in our recent history? 
 
18:52:27  
 
Gene Healy: 
Well, I'm afraid I don't have anything good to say about any of the recent ones, but I do always 
tell people that Warren G. Harding gets a bad rap.  
 
[laughter]  
 
It's time America forgave him for teapot dome. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Gene Healy.  
 
[applause]  
 
And Gene, tell us who your partner is. 
 
Gene Healy: 
The distinguished and charming Deborah Pearlstein. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Deborah Pearlstein.  
 
[applause]  
 
Deborah, you're also arguing for the motion that The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional 
Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Approval.  You are a professor of Cardozo Law.  
You served as the founding director of the Law and Security program at Human Rights First.  
Like your partner, Gene, you believe that the president has overreached, but you trace the 
problem back to the framers of the Constitution, who made what critical mistake?

If I had to sum it up, I'd say they expected that the legislature would actually want to legislate.

John Donvan: 
And it hasn't worked out.  Ladies and gentlemen, the team arguing for this motion.  
 
[applause]  
 
Again, the motion is that The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging 
War Without Congressional Authorization.  Two debaters arguing against this motion.  Please, 
let's first welcome Philip Bobbitt.  
 
[applause]  
 
Philip, you have a bit of a hometown crowd here because you are a professor at Columbia Law 
School, and director of its Center for National Security.  You are a constitutional scholar.  You've 
been a history don at Oxford.  You've advised presidents on national security issues since the 
Carter Administration.  You wrote, a few years back, that the seeds of confusion that surround 
the whole question we're debating tonight -- presidential war powers -- actually started 
building up 50 years ago, beginning with what? 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
I think it began with a number of senators experiencing buyer’s remorse over the Gulf of Tonkin 
resolution. 
 
John Donvan: 
And here we are now, 50 years later.  Not much progress made. 
 
18:54:28  
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
And counting. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Philip Bobbitt.

Intelligence Squared U.S. 6 4/1/15 

This is Akhil Amar, who has been called the most celebrated constitutional scholar of his 
generation. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Akhil Amar.  
 
[applause]  
 
And Akhil, you're also arguing against this motion, that The President Has Exceeded His 
Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.  You are a 
professor at Yale Law.  You have been described as, quote, "commendably unorthodox."  
Congratulations.  You are also the author of a lot of books.  Most recently, "America's 
Unwritten Constitution."  So, in a sentence, tell me who writes America's unwritten 
Constitution. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
The American people.  We've given our hearts and minds to Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of 
Independence, to Abe Lincoln's Gettysburg address -- in the middle of an undeclared war, by 
the way -- to Martin King's "I have a dream" speech, to Brown v. Board of Education.  These are 
all elements of America's unwritten Constitution. 
 
18:55:31  
 
John Donvan: 
So, a lot of history in this story and in this debate tonight.  Please welcome all of our debaters.  
Thank you as we -- 
 
[applause] 
 
-- move forward to the first vote by the audience.  Because this is a debate it's a contest, and 
you our live audience here at the Miller Theatre, will determine the winner by your vote.  By 
the time the arguments have been presented you will have been asked to vote twice, once 
before and once after hearing them, and the team whose numbers have moved you the most in 
percentage point terms will be declared our winner.  So let's register your first vote.  If you go 
to those keypads at your seat, again, pay attention to numbers one, two, and three.  Take a 
close look at the motion The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority By Waging 
War Without Congressional Authorization.  If you agree with this motion, push number one.  If 
you disagree push number two.  If you are undecided push number three.  You can ignore the 
other keys, which are not live, and if you inadvertently push the wrong key just correct yourself 
and the system will lock in your last vote.

Intelligence Squared U.S. 7 4/1/15 

No one needs more time, correct?  Okay.  Let's move forward.  Let's move onto round one.  
Round one, opening statements by each debater in turn.  They will be six minutes each, and 
here speaking in the first position, I'd like to welcome to her lectern, Deborah Pearlstein.  She's 
an assistant professor at the Cardozo Law of -- the Cardozo School of Law, and former director 
of the Law and Security program at Human Rights First.  She is arguing for the motion: The 
President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority By Waging War Without Congressional 
Authorization.  Ladies and gentlemen, Deborah Pearlstein.  
 
[applause] 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, it's a pleasure to be here, and thank you for the opportunity.  The 
president has certainly exceeded his constitutional power by waging war without Congressional 
authorization for the following reasons.   
 
18:57:34 
 
First, as Nick Rosenkranz mentioned at the top, the text of the Constitution, the history, are 
actually quite clear on the idea that power over armed forces, power to commit those troops, 
to make war wherever they do it, is shared between the executive and the Congress.  The 
executive would have the power as commander in chief to superintend the armed forces.  He 
would also have the power to repel sudden attacks in the event our nation came under attack, 
but the vast majority of the power over the armed forces, and over war making in the United 
States, if you look in the Constitution, it's there under Article I Section 8.  It's given to Congress.  
They have the power to raise and support an army, to provide and maintain a navy, to issue 
letters of mark and reprisal, an old fashioned way of saying to appoint agents or to hire agents 
of the U.S. government, who would carry out lesser military actions against our enemies.   
 
18:58:31 
 
And of course, Congress also has the power to declare war.  The reason this matters, the text 
matters, is because the purpose of the framers was also clear.  The president would have the 
power to act in our national defense if it was necessary, but actually commencing war, risking 
huge sums in national blood and treasure, that no one man should have the power to do.  
Madison said, "In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause 
which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive.  The 
trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man."  Now, my opponents will tell 
you that it's not so much what the text of the Constitution says, or even why the Constitution 
said it that way, but what matters is what we've actually done, and in particular, what 
presidents have actually done in the past, say, 50 or 60 years of the nation's history, because 
before that they almost always went to Congress to at least get an authorization for the use of 
force.

Intelligence Squared U.S. 8 4/1/15 

 
So, let's set aside for the moment the notion that it's a little bit of a weird way to interpret the 
Constitution by saying, well, it means whatever the president has been doing, and thinks he can 
get away with, in every -- any given administration.  Let's set that aside for a minute.  Let's also 
set aside the problem of that methodology, which is how do we decide we agree on what 
particular presidents did, and more importantly, why they were doing it.  Were they acting in 
national defense or did they have a clear sense even in their own minds of what the purpose 
was for deploying force in a given case?  Let's set both of those aside for now and make it clear 
that no president in the United States has declared or asserted an unlimited power to make war 
without congressional authorization.  The Office of Legal Counsel -- right, this is the office in the 
Department of Justice that counsels the president on how much power he has to use force 
abroad -- recognizes in its memoranda limits that the president has to follow when he uses 
force without congressional authorization.   
 
19:00:32 
 
And even this president, his OLC said "Look, you can only do this without Congress if it's in the 
national interest, and if the force that you're using is less than war."  Why does it matter?  Well, 
of course, because the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war.  So if what you're 
doing is actual war, then you actually have to go to Congress.  How do you tell the difference 
between what's war and what's not war by this president's own metric?  Well, in Libya, the last 
time he used force without congressional authorization, he said it was because, this is a short 
term commitment, right?  We're not going to be there very long.  We're going to get in.  We're 
going to get out.  We're going to have a very limited mission, right?  Just protecting civilians 
pursuant to a U.N. Security Council Resolution, and there will be minimal risk to Americans in 
any event, right?  The problem today is that the conflict against ISIL in Iraq and Syria is, even by 
the president's own metric, war, in a constitutional sense.   
 
19:01:29 
 
The president said when he committed troops, when he expanded our operations in Iraq and 
Syria, that this is going to take some time.  He announced a broad mission.  Our mission is not 
to protect particular individuals or even keep the peace.  Our mission is broadly to destroy and 
degrade another organization, ISIL, the "Islamic State" as it calls itself.  By January of this year, 
the United States had carried out close to 10,000 airstrikes in the region; we have 7,000 
contractors in our employee -- in our employ on the ground; and 4,500 military personnel 
already serving in the theater.  "Okay," my opponents will say, "but that's fine."  So what 
matters is not even so much what the president has done in the past.  What matters is what 
works.  We need the flexibility.  The president needs the ability to respond to new threats, to 
new dangers.  And that does matter.  But in this case, that's not what's going on.

Intelligence Squared U.S. 9 4/1/15 

There has been more than enough time, there remains enough time for Congress to authorize 
the use of force.  Indeed, the president has gone to Congress and asked it to authorize the use 
of force in the case of ISIL.  There is plenty, further, of strategic cause for Congress to authorize 
force.  Congressional authorization is an incredibly important signal.  It signals our allies that 
we're serious about the fight.  It signals our enemies that we're serious about the fight.  And it 
signals, particularly in a conflict like this, to what our security friends call, "Wavering neutrals in 
the region," right?  Those folks who looked at what we did in the past conflicts, they looked at 
Abu Ghraib, they looked at Guantanamo, they said, "I don't buy the United States," and it 
shows them we're as good as our word.  For all of these reasons, the framers thought so; it 
remains a good idea.  You need to vote for the resolution.  Congress needs to authorize the use 
of force.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Deborah Pearlstein. 
 
[applause] 
 
And our motion is, "The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War 
Without Congressional Authorization."   
 
19:03:31 
 
And here to argue against this motion, please welcome Philip Bobbitt.  He is the Herbert 
Wechsler Professor of Federal Jurisprudence at Columbia Law School, and a distinguished 
senior lecturer at the University of Texas.  Ladies and gentlemen, Philip Bobbitt. 
 
[applause] 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
I agree.  I'm not going to dismiss the text and the history.  I'm not going to rely on the practices 
of the last 60 years.  I agree.  Congress should be on record about this.  Congress should 
authorize war against the Islamic State.  And I believe, and my partner, Professor Amar, believe 
that Congress has, that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force in 2001 empowers the 
president to use deadly force against the Islamic State.   
 
19:04:22 
 
Now, you may be told that the AUMF, as we’ll call it, of 2001 authorized retaliation against al-
Qaeda for the atrocities on 9/11, and therefore, it can't apply to the Islamic State because the 
Islamic State didn't exist in 2001, and furthermore, that since it has distanced itself from the 
core al-Qaeda leadership, it can't be responsible for the 9/11 attack.  To see if this is as clinching 
as it sounds, let's take a close look at the joint resolution adopted by both houses of Congress 
and signed into law by the president that we'll be discussing tonight.  That law is not simply 
about holding an organization responsible for the past attacks on the U.S., but about deterring

Intelligence Squared U.S. 10 4/1/15 

new attacks.  It is not even about one organization, al-Qaeda, or about plural groups.  The 
AUMF advanced in 2001 provided for the use -- and I will quote -- "of all necessary and 
appropriate force in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the 
United States by organizations," plural, “that the president determines authorized the terrorist 
attacks of September the 11th.” Unquote. 
 
19:05:41 
 
If the president determines that the use of force against the Islamic State is necessary and 
appropriate in order to prevent future acts of terrorism by the network of which the Islamic 
State was admittedly a part, which had authorized the attacks of 9/11, then Congress's 
language is quite sufficient to authorize the actions the president proposes.  To vote for our 
opponents, you must conclude that there is no rational way the president could make this 
determination, that there is no conceivable way he could find that action against the Islamic 
State might deter the loose network of shifting alliances that is united in its objective to found 
an Islamist caliphate, and by acts of terror like 9/11, to intimidate the United States from 
acquiescing in this objective.   
 
19:06:37 
 
It is significant that the Congress agrees with our view.  So, they have recently passed -- as we 
all know -- legislation appropriating funds for air attacks on the Islamic State, which they would 
scarcely have done if they believed the president could not constitutionally execute the 
legislation they passed.  It is also significant that the federal courts in the Guantanamo cases 
have unanimously accepted the view that the Islamic State is an associated force of Al-Qaeda, 
bringing the Islamic State within the ambit of the charters for the use of force that Congress has 
passed.  Moreover, there are ample precedents for using congressional authorizations for war 
to apply to subsequent groups when later hostilities emerge where conflict initially authorized.   
 
19:07:26 
 
The most pertinent example is not the last 60 years, but from the Philippines War in 1898, in 
which U.S. forces, having defeated the Spanish against whom Congress had authorized war, 
found themselves attacked by Philippine insurgents, who had actually fought the Spanish.  U.S. 
forces proceeded to wage war against the Philippine insurgents without any further 
congressional authorization, choosing instead to rely on the initial declaration of war against 
Spain.  No one doubts that the Islamic State emerged out of the conflict in Iraq, authorized by 
the AUMF of 2002, nor that it was created as an arm of Al-Qaeda -- its original name was Al-
Qaeda in Mesopotamia -- against whom the AUMF of 2001 was directed.  There are other 
examples of Albania, Croatia, Slovakia in World War II that stand to the principle that fresh 
authority is not needed if the new belligerent emerges from an originally authorized conflict 
and wages war against us.

Intelligence Squared U.S. 11 4/1/15 

 
Finally, it is simply absurd to hold that the Islamic State would be free from those pre-existing 
authorizations on the ground that it has changed its name or denounced its former leaders.  
While this might make some sort of sense in a world of nation-states, in the wars we are 
currently fighting, new groups pop up all the time, change their names, denounce their leaders.  
Just two weeks ago Boko Haram announced it was going to be part of the Islamic State.  Would 
we really want a rule that required a fresh congressional statute every time a terrorist leader 
changed his name after he'd attacked us or tweeted an attack on his former allies?  Congress, 
the courts, and the president all agree on the constitutional and statutory proposition that 
Professor Amar and I are asserting.   
 
19:09:30 
 
If you disagree, you must have good constitutional grounds.  That's right.  In the text, in the 
structure, in the history, you must find the case law, the historical precedents, the strategic 
practicality, which counts too -- and only then can you be compelled to disagree.

Thank you.  Philip Bobbitt.

And a reminder of where we are.  We are halfway through the opening round of this 
Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four debaters, two teams of two, 
fighting it out over this motion: The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by 
Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.  You've heard from the first two debaters.  
And now onto a third.  We're going to welcome to the lectern Gene Healy.  He is a vice 
president of the Cato Institute and author of "The Cult of the Presidency: America's Dangerous 
Devotion to Executive Power."  He is arguing in support of the motion that the President Has 
Exceeded His Constitutional Authority.  Please welcome Gene Healy.  
 
19:10:34  
 
[applause] 
 
Gene Healy: 
Thank you.  The president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without 
Congressional authorization, or to put tonight's debate resolution another way, the president 
does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a 
situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.  You may 
have heard that second formulation before.  It's how candidate Obama described the limits of 
presidential war powers when he was asked about it during campaign 2008.  And it came up a 
lot about three years later when President Obama unilaterally launched a seven-month 
bombing campaign against Libya.  Not only was there no actual or imminent threat to the

nation in that case, but 10 days into the bombing, the president's own secretary of defense 
went on “Meet the Press” and admitted that Libya wasn't a vital interest to the United States.   
 
19:11:38 
 
The president took us into our latest war in the Middle East, the ongoing conflict against ISIS, 
last August.  Here again there was no imminent threat.  "We have not yet detected specific 
plotting against our homeland," President Obama told the country in his nationally televised 
address, and yet he waited six months and over 2,000 airstrikes before he got around to 
sending a draft request for authorization to Congress, along with a cover note insisting that 
“existing statutes provide me with all the authority I need to wage war anyway.”  The central 
basis for that claim, as Professor Bobbitt notes, is the 2001 AUMF, the resolution that Congress 
passed three days after 9/11 empowering the president to take military action against "those 
nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 
September 11th attacks, or harbored those who did."

Now, not exclusively, but principally, obviously, al-Qaeda and the Taliban.  And judging by what 
the people in Congress said about it at the time, the people who passed it certainly didn't think 
they were committing the United States to open-ended, multi-generational war.  Now, nearly 
14 years later, this war has gone on 10 years longer than World War II, four years longer than 
Vietnam, and counting.  Under the 9/11 AUMF President Obama has launched six times the 
number of drone strikes as President Bush against groups with evermore tenuous and remote 
connections to the language -- to the resolution's language and original target.  Two years ago 
Obama officials told the Washington Post that they were increasingly concerned that the law is 
being stretched to its legal breaking point.   
 
19:13:33 
 
That was before they'd stretched it still further.  President Obama now argues that the 9/11 
AUMF allows him to go after -- go to war with groups like ISIS that have not just distanced 
themselves from al-Qaeda, but have been denounced and excommunicated by al-Qaeda.  It 
may even allow, and the theory -- the administration's theory of the 2001 AUMF, it may even 
allow him to go after ISIS’s offshoots and sympathizers as so-called “associated forces” of a 
force that al-Qaeda refuses to associate with.  Earlier this month at a Senate hearing, President 
Obama's new secretary of defense acknowledged that the resolution may be broad enough to 
allow the president to wage war in Nigeria against Boko Haram, which recently pledged 
allegiance to ISIS on Twitter.   
 
19:14:33 
 
In fact, the administration's interpretation of the 9/11 AUMF is so broad they can't tell you how 
broad it is.  For one thing, who we're at war with is classified.  In testimony last May, the

Pentagon's general counsel told the Senate that which groups the administration claims legal 
authority to target under the AUMF, well, that's something that they're "just not prepared to 
discuss in an open session."  Meanwhile, Obama administration officials admit that there's no 
end in sight to worldwide war making.  The war on terror will go on "at least 10 to 20 years 
more," which means, I suppose, that in 2032, when we're all filled with excitement about the 
impending presidential contest between Chelsea Clinton and George P. Bush -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
19:15:36 
 
-- we can rest assured that the winner will get to use the September 2001 AUMF as the basis for 
his or her presidential kill list.  This is not how constitutional democracies are supposed to make 
the most important decision that any society can make.  President Obama has exceeded his 
constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization, but it's worse than 
that.  The arguments he's advanced will make it even easier for future presidents to do the 
same.  I urge you to vote, "Yes," on the motion.  Thank you.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Gene Healy.  And the motion is that “The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional 
Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization."  And here to argue against this 
motion, please welcome Akhil Amar.  He is Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science at 
Yale, where he teaches constitutional law at both Yale College and Yale Law School.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, Akhil Amar. 
 
[applause] 
 
Akhil Amar: 
Good evening.  So you've heard this expression a couple of times from our distinguished 
opponents, "AUMF."  Let's just slow down a second and hear what the AUMF is.  It's the 
authorization of the use of military force.  Here's the resolution, "The President Has Exceeded 
His Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization."  The AUMF 
is a congressional thing.  It's a self-described authorization of the use of military force; that is 
"waging war."  Sometimes -- you know, I don't know how many of you have kids, but I've got 
three, and sometimes my wife and I say like, "What part of, 'No,' did you not understand?" 
 
[laughter] 
 
What part of the “authorization of the use of military force” are we not understanding here?

Intelligence Squared U.S. 14 4/1/15 

Let's go over, once again, what that statute says, because we've heard, "Well, Congress didn't 
intend this and didn't intend that."  Congress uses words to express its intent.  If they didn't 
want an authorization to be temporally open-ended, you know what they can do?  They can put 
a sunset provision in that authorization that says, "This sunsets after a certain point in time."  
They did not do that.  And they do do that in other laws.  See the Patriot Act.  In fact, what they 
say in the law very explicitly in this authorization is to prevent, quote, "any future attack against 
the United States by these various organizations.”  Let me go over once again what it says, "The 
president” -- the president -- "is authorized to use all” -- what part of all don't you -- "necessary 
and appropriate force against nations," with an S, "organizations," with an S, "and persons he 
determines” -- and I think I will concede in brackets -- in good faith and reasonably, on the basis 
of information that he has that not all of us have in this room, frankly, "that he determines 
planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 attacks, or harbored such organizations or 
persons," okay? "in order to prevent any future attack," okay?   
 
19:18:55  
 
Now, if you know just general legal principles, you can have persons and organizations, who are 
aiders and abettors after the fact.  They're harborers after the fact, and that's what ISIS is.  It's 
an offshoot of al-Qaeda, as you've heard.  Here's what winning a war actually means: 
sometimes you smash one organization, and it splinters, and now you have to deal with the 
splinters, you know?  Hercules is making some progress when he slices off each of the heads of 
the hydra, but initially you get two that grow back.  But it's the same basic hydra, and you've 
got to deal with the root.  It's the same problem.   
 
19:19:38  
 
So -- and the president gets to make this determination, at least if it's in good faith.  These, 
ladies and gentlemen, ISIL, ISIS, involve some of the same persons.  You have not heard our 
distinguished opponents deny that, and I'd like to hear if they deny that they're some of the 
same persons.  And that's not fighting everyone around the world at any time.  No one in this 
room is a member -- was a member of al-Qaeda, a leader.  So it's only certain organizations that 
have the same persons.  ISIL and ISIS are using the same tactics, the tactics of terror, as al-
Qaeda.  They have the same murderous purpose, and frankly it's a murderous purpose to 
murder us, and our ideals, and -- which takes me to the fourth point -- they have the same 
target, us, U.S.  That's U.S., the United States, that's us, small U, small S, no periods. 
 
19:20:36 
 
Okay?  Same persons.  At least a subset of them.  Same terror tactics.  Same murderous 
purpose.  Same target.  You heard my distinguished colleague, Professor Bobbitt, channel 
Shakespeare.  "What's in a name?"  You know, so they -- so they changed their name.  Are you 
going to allow the same -- you know, this offshoot entity to escape the clear language of this 
authorization, which is about preventing future attacks, just because they changed their name?  
I invoked Lincoln earlier.  By the way, you know that Civil War wasn’t a formal declaration of

war back then.  But Lincoln was surely not exceeding his authorization because -- his 
constitutional authority because Congress actually authorized it -- although not by formal 
declaration -- in the same way that Congress authorized John Adams, in the same way that 
Congress authorized Thomas Jefferson.  
 
19:21:30  
 
We don't have to just pick the last 50 years.  And John Adams is fighting the French.  And 
Jefferson is fighting the Barbary Pirates.  And these are not formal, declared wars, but they are 
congressionally authorized military actions.  So, let me -- let me just close with Abraham Lincoln 
-- since I invoked Shakespeare.  And I told you, he's part of our unwritten constitution.  There's 
a reason he's up there on Mount Rushmore.  And you know, he's a very simple, common-
sensical fellow who says, "If you call a tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have?"  And the 
answer, ladies and gentlemen, is four.  Because calling a tail a leg don't make it so.  
 
[laughter]  
 
Okay? And changing the name doesn't mean that this is any different from the very forces that 
this authorization of the use of military force was essentially about.  Thank you very much.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Akhil Amar.  And that concludes opening statements in this Intelligence Squared 
U.S. debate, where our motion is: The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by 
Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.  
 
19:22:40  
 
And now we move on to Round 2.  In Round 2, the debaters address one another in -- directly, 
and they take questions from me and from you, our live audience here at the Miller Theater at 
Columbia University.  We have this motion in front of us: The President Has Exceeded His 
Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.  The team 
arguing for this motion -- that the president has gone too far -- Deborah Pearlstein and Gene 
Healy have argued that it's right there in writing.  It's in the Constitution.  Congress declares 
wars, not the president; that this president, President Obama, has taken more license with war-
making than any president in history; that ISIL is an enemy in the conventional sense of 
conventional war, and therefore, all of the normal rules should apply.   
 
19:23:29  
 
But presidential actions, like the bombing of Libya, amount to one man unilaterally taking the 
nation to war without -- in some cases -- justification of true threats to the nation, and that this 
is not how a constitutional democracy makes the most important decisions that it ever has to

Intelligence Squared U.S. 16 4/1/15 

face.  The team arguing against the motion -- Akhil Amar and Philip Bobbitt -- are arguing that 
indeed the president has the authorization to take the war to ISIL, that it is the same 
authorization that was given to George Bush in 2001 after September 11th to defeat enemies, 
such as Al-Qaeda.  It was inherited by Barack Obama; that its elasticity is a matter of 
practicality, because the enemy changes, and it hasn't changed that much; that in a lot of ways, 
the guys in ISIL are the same people, with the same tactics, and the same target -- us -- as the 
target that was chosen by Al-Qaeda on September 11th.  
 
19:24:23  
 
I want to take that part of the argument to the team that's arguing for the motion and ask them 
about that notion: that, in fact, what -- the authorization given to George Bush in 2001 still 
applies, primarily because we're still fighting the same guys in the same extended war.  Do you 
want take that, Deborah Pearlstein? 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
Sure.  So I find the notion, to use the word, absurd.  The text of the authorization for the use of 
force doesn't name them.  Congress never conceived that ISIL was the group that they meant to 
be authorizing force -- again, in part, because ISIL and even Al-Qaeda in Iraq -- as it used to be 
called by the United States -- didn't exist in 2001.  And this group, just because it once had 
some association with Al-Qaeda that did exist in 2001, isn't it.  You know, the United States is 
an offshoot of Great Britain in some fundamental way, but I'd like to think, after a certain time 
and a certain set of disagreements, you can tell the difference -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But do -- 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
-- between one and another. 
 
John Donvan: 
Deborah, do you concede the sameness argument, that they're -- they might be somewhat 
different people, different name, but that their game is the same? 
 
19:25:29 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
I don't.  In fact, it's not just a name.  It's a fundamental mission.  So, when Al-Qaeda attacked us 
on 9/11 and before, Osama Bin Laden named the United States its primary enemy.  He declared 
war against the United States.  He attacked the United States repeatedly.  He viewed the United 
States and its political operations and factions in the Middle East as the source of the problem.  
ISIL is in essence an apocalyptic cult.  They fight the United States today for the same reason 
that they fight al-Qaeda today, because they believe that they are not true believers of 
Islamism in the way they believe it should be practiced, and they do not take the United States

as its enemy per se any more than they take anyone else.  In other words, it’s not just the name 
that’s different, the mission of the group -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Let me take that to your opponent.  Phillip Bobbitt, do you want to respond to that?  
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
Sure.  The current leader of ISIL, the Islamic state, al-Baghdadi, said when he was released from 
our custody where he'd been for some months, “I'll see you next in New York.” 
 
19:26:32  
 
John Donvan: 
And your silence speaks for the rest of your thought.  I'll take it back to Gene Healy.  
 
Gene Healy: 
Yeah, the notion that all they did was change their name is not right, as Deborah's pointed out.  
I'd also say that, as she pointed out, the ISIS strategy is to focus on the near enemy.  Al-Qaeda's 
strategy is to focus on the far enemy.  The fact that ISIS has local apocalyptic and monstrous 
goals may explain -- and the fact that they're locally focused probably helps explain why evey 
major figure in the national security establishment, from the chairman of the joint chiefs to two 
heads of the National Counterterrorism Center, has said that there is no evidence that ISIS has 
plans or major capability to attack the homeland.  
 
John Donvan: 
I'll take that to Akhil Amar.  
 
19:27:25  
 
Akhil Amar: 
So remember that the authorization of the use of military force that I tried to read slowly and 
carefully to you addresses not just the original organizations, but any other organizations or 
persons that aided them or that harbored them, and their successors.  So, it's about, I think to 
paraphrase my partner, a broad network of affiliate organizations.  I should've also probably 
said it's the same basic theater of war and the same geographic target, namely New York -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, respond to Gene's point, though, that this particular group, ISIL, is not necessarily -- 
actually, stronger than that, that it appears not to be a direct threat to the United States.  Is 
that relevant?  
 
Akhil Amar:

Intelligence Squared U.S. 18 4/1/15 

Well, the president of the -- that might go to the wisdom of, and proportionality of what sort of 
force is to be used, but he invoked a lot of people that I don’t actually see in this authorization 
the use of military force.   
 
19:28:29  
 
What I see talks about the president, not the joint chiefs of staff or anyone else.  In our system 
we elect a president, and actually we elect him because we think he has good judgment.  He 
tells us basically what his fundamental approach is, and actually we re-elected him -- and that 
was true of Mr. Lincoln and that's true of Mr. Obama -- and he's the one who determines that 
he has to have some evidence for it in good faith and I've seen no evidence of that 
[unintelligible]. 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
There might be some limits to that proposition, right?  The president determines, he alone.  So 
if the president determines alone in a fit of pique that China is in fact now al-Qaeda, right, does 
the authorization for the use of military force to authorize the president to go after those who 
attacked us on 9/11 authorize the president to use force against anyone?  
 
Akhil Amar: 
How many people who are in charge of China have any -- are the same people who are in al-
Qaeda?  And the answer is zero, okay?  There are a gazillion organizations in the world and 
nation states, and they do not have any overlap whatsoever with the original al-Qaeda.  
 
19:29:27  
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
We detained people in Guantanamo who were from China.  We let them go actually not all that 
long ago, right?  So the notion that there are some of the same people in some of these same 
places I think is insufficient to establish what the administration says, which is not that ISIL is an 
associated group of al-Qaeda or an off-shoot, but that ISIL is al-Qaeda, right?  The 
administration can't say they're an associated force.  ISIL and al-Qaeda are shooting at each 
other.  
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
I'm glad you mentioned -- 
 
John Donvan:

Islamic state is in fact an associated force with al-Qaeda?  What do you do with that?  What do 
you do with the fact that -- 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
Which court has held that -- 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
-- Congress -- what do you do with the fact that Congress has authorized funds for air attacks on 
the Islamic State?  You say, what do we do if Barak Obama decided to attack Brooklyn, or what 
would we do if they decide to attack Norway, what would we do -- well, one thing you would 
do is that Congress would say this is not appropriate, as the statute requires, but the Congress 
has spoken about this.  What do you guys say about the authorization of our air attacks on the 
Islamic state?  That's [inaudible]. 
 
19:30:39  
 
John Donvan: 
Deborah Pearlstein. 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
If I took everything that Congress does as proof of its constitutionality, I would have to 
challenge, right, Marbury versus Madison.  Just because Congress has passed a law doesn't 
mean the law Congress has passed is constitutional. 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
So you think the authorization for funds for air attacks on the Islamic state is unconstitutional? 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
I think -- 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
Fine.  Why? 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
-- I don't think -- Congress's authorization -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Does it violate the text -- 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
-- for the use of funds is constitutional, but I don't think we can take their authorization for the 
use of funds as a commentary on whether or not they think the president has the power to 
wage war without congressional authorization.

John Donvan: 
Can we take a -- can we take a little bit -- 
 
Akhil Amar: 
[inaudible] congressional authorization.  See, there's authorization of the use of military force, 
and then there's a second congressional authorization with the House and the Senate and the 
president once they actually know who's being bombed. 
 
19:31:25  
 
John Donvan: 
Can we take a step back from these specifics for just a bit and then return to them?  But I just 
want to go a little bit to the constitutional -- to the textual issues, and just ask each of you, by 
looking at the language of the constitution what does -- what power does it give Congress over 
-- what check does it give over the president in your opinion, in the broad, in broad principle?  
And I'll go to this side first.  Either one of you wants to take it, Gene Healy, or Deborah 
Pearlstein. 
 
Gene Healy: 
Well, as Deborah said, the bulk of the war powers are with Congress.  The declare war clause, 
which Madison identified as the part of the Constitution, where the most wisdom was to be 
found, is an independent check on -- or it was intended to be an independent check on 
presidential ability to initiate war.  All the -- you know, most of the framers who spoke about 
this power, James Wilson, the architect of the presidency, said, "This system will not hurry us 
into war.  It is calculated to guard against it."   
 
19:32:27  
 
And he identified the declare war clause as the clause he was talking about.  George 
Washington wasn't sure he had the power to launch offensive operations against Indians 
without an authorization from Congress.  So this was an important check.  Moreover, where 
does the president get the power?  The president doesn't get the power from the commander 
in chief clause, and Alexander Hamilton said that was -- that meant nothing more than that he 
was the first general and admiral of the United States, and generals and admirals don't get to 
decide whether and with whom we go to war. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, let me take that to the other side.  Do you agree with that assessment of 
[unintelligible]? 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
I'm surprised.

Philip Bobbitt. 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
I thought -- and I must say, I was very impressed by this -- I thought our opponents were not 
going to say that we required a declaration of war.  I thought their point was that we required 
congressional authorization.  It could be by a declaration of war, it could be by a joint 
resolution, it could be by a statute, but we had to have congressional authorization.   
 
19:33:29  
 
Now Mr. Healy begins to suggest that perhaps that isn't enough, that you also need a 
declaration of war.  Now, if we want to talk about that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, I didn't ask -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
-- wait, wait, wait -- in fairness to Gene, I did not ask him whether there needed to be a 
declaration of war in this instance.  I was asking him in the broad principle where the power line 
goes. 
 
Gene Healy: 
You don't need the magic words, you didn't -- it was recognized from the first generation that 
you did not need formal authorization.  You need some kind of substantive authorization that 
perhaps is renewed more than once a generation. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
How about a statute whose title is, "The Authorization of the Use of Military Force," that -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
[inaudible] 
 
Akhil Amar: 
-- explicitly has no sunset and says that it applies -- it's adopted in order to, quote, "prevent any 
future attack of a 9/11 --" 
 
Gene Healy: 
You've mentioned that clause several times, and the actual history of that -- 
 
Akhil Amar: 
-- yeah. 
 
Gene Healy:

Intelligence Squared U.S. 22 4/1/15 

-- no, the actual history of that clause was the Bush administration's original draft of the AUMF 
gave the president the power to deter and -- an independent power to deter and preempt all 
future acts of terrorism against the United States.   
 
19:34:38  
 
That was so horrifying to a Congress, even in the aftershock of 9/11, that they changed that 
language to dis-link [spelled phonetically] that as an independent power. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
To apply -- 
 
Gene Healy: 
He has the power to go after persons or organizations linked to 9/11 for the purpose of -- 
 
Akhil Amar: 
-- linked to al-Qaeda, linked to the folks who did it in 9/11, and that's our claim, these guys are 
linked to them. 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
I think it's an important distinction -- 
 
Gene Healy: 
Well, they're shooting at each other. 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
-- the language isn't linked to 9/11.  The language is linked to the perpetrators of 9/11. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
Aiding or harboring them, ex-ante or ex-post -- 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
The language isn't linked.  The language is “responsible for the attacks of 9/11.”   
 
19:35:23  
 
And I want to come back to the question that was posed here a minute ago, which is "Why is it 
that we should have” -- and we all agree, right, some congressional authorization is required -- 
the notion is, "Well, you don't have to say specifically who the enemy is, right?  The enemy can 
be al-Qaeda, the Taliban, associated forces, people responsible for the attacks of 9/11, or 
whoever, right?  The reason why you need Congressional authorization and the reason why you 
have to name who the enemy is, is the same.  It is in order for Congress to have a meaningful 
check in a democracy.  You can't lead a people into war without telling them who they're going 
to war against and why.  So --

Akhil Amar: 
So, this is -- 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
-- that's why naming the enemy is as important -- 
 
Akhil Amar: 
This is -- 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
-- as the authorization in the first place. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
This is the second time that you've actually suggested -- at least the second time -- that the real 
constitutional culprit here is not the president, but that Congress has somehow passed an 
unconstitutional statute, which is a very odd proposition to me. 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
I don't think I was suggesting Congress passed a -- 
 
Akhil Amar: 
So, Congress passed a statute that didn't read the way you would have drafted it, mentioning 
al-Qaeda by name, and for very good reasons, because we wouldn't want to let them change 
their -- you know, just call themselves "Shal-Qaeda" or, you know --  
 
[laughter] 
 
19:36:31 
 
So, they actually -- you're saying, "Well, unless you actually name the organization, it's not 
valid."  And we're saying, where did you get that from? 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
I'm saying the statute is entirely constitutional.  And all three branches of government have 
concluded that the statute authorized the use of force against three groups -- al-Qaeda, the 
Taliban, and associated forces.  ISIL is not the Taliban.  The administration says they're not 
associated forces, because after all, they're fighting with each other.  The administration says 
they're Al-Qaeda, and I'm telling you, there's no sense in which they're Al-Qaeda.  And I'm not 
the only one who says that, because I'm after all, not that persuasive, right?  You've got to read 
the West Point Counterterrorism Center report.  You've got to read, actually, a wonderful piece

got to be a recognition of who we're talking about.  And this isn't it.

Philip Bobbitt: 
Well, this is what puzzles me.  You say we have to read a West Point manual, but you're not 
prepared to take what every federal court that has considered this matter has said: that the 
Islamic State is an associated force.  You say, "We want to reassess this and decide how the 
phrases ought to have been used."  But you're not prepared to answer what you do with a 
Congressional appropriation.

John Donvan: 
Let me move onto another question, to the side that's arguing for the motion that the president 
has exceeded.  Your opponents have -- on the one hand, while arguing that ISIL is the same as 
the -- essentially, the same as the group that was specified in the 2001 authorization, they're -- 
they also argue that the state of -- in the state of the world today, war is a very changing thing,

that it would be -- as Philip Bobbitt said -- absurd to have to issue a new resolution every time a 
new entrant showed up on the field, a new combatant showed up on the field.  
 
19:38:37  
 
Some permutation of -- and that you just can't -- you can't operate that way, which is a very 
compelling argument.  I want to see what your response is to that, Gene Healy. 
 
Gene Healy: 
I think the president has residual powers under Article II to deal with -- you know, Deborah 
mentioned the phrase, "Repelling sudden attacks," which comes up at the Constitutional 
Convention.  And I think you can be flexible with that.  I don't think you have to be wedded to 
an 18th century understanding, or one that doesn't comport with modern warfare.  But you do 
have to -- for the president to legitimately use this reserved Article II power, it has to actually 
be a threat to the country.  And it -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Was Libya -- 
 
Gene Healy: 
-- [unintelligible] -- 
 
John Donvan: 
-- was Libya a threat? 
 
Gene Healy: 
Not in the remotest sense. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me take that to the other side.  Libya.  Your response.  Akhil Amar. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
I'll say something about Libya in one second, but-- again, just remembering the statute, the 
statute is about not just repelling attack, but preventing future attack, okay?  
 
19:39:37  
 
Now, if we -- if they've conceded on ISIL and ISIS -- I'm happy about that.  If that's now put off 
the table, and now we're just talking about Libya, I'm happy to address Libya.  And -- 
 
John Donvan: 
For the record, they have not conceded.

Akhil Amar: 
-- [unintelligible] -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I believe you say you won the point, but they have not conceded. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
Now, on Libya -- just like a simple point.  You know, how many body bags were there in Libya?  
And apart from one embassy attack, this does not seem to me like full-blown war. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ah. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
And there's language in the war powers resolution -- and if you want to read my piece on this, I 
wrote a piece in Slate on this that I think actually authorized the use of force in that situation.   
 
19:40:29  
 
And you could read the testimony.  But we know what war looks like.  Vietnam was a war.  And 
there were body-bags. 50,000 of them.  We know what wars look like.  Korea.  There were no 
body bags in the Libyan intervention, and in that sense, it's much more like all sorts of things 
that Ronald Reagan did in Grenada, all sorts of uses of force that really don't rise to the level of 
full-blown war.  
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  I want to go to audience questions in a moment.  I want to remind you again, if you raise 
your hand someone will -- I'll call on you.  If you could stand up.  Someone will come to you 
with a microphone.  Hold it about as far away from your mouth as this is so that we can all hear 
you.  Tell us your name and ask your question.  Again, it needs to be tight and a question, but 
most importantly needs to be on this topic of the constitutional divide.  And while you're 
getting ready to do that, I just want to take -- to decide arguing for the motion what your 
opponent was just saying in terms of Libya wasn't a war, and I think we need maybe to spend 
one minute or so on talking about language here, what we mean by a war.  Does it matter how 
we define war in this conversation?

Gene Healy: 
Well, you just said -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Gene Healy.   
 
Gene Healy: 
-- Professor Amar was doing a lot better than Secretary of Defense Gates in that he was able to 
make that argument with a straight face.  
 
[laughter] 
 
When Gates, once in Congress and once on 60 Minutes, tried to sell the idea that launching 
thousands of Tomahawk missiles at another sovereign country wasn't war, he had to smirk.  
That was the line he was given to sell and he did not sell it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Did he smirk?  
 
Gene Healy: 
Yeah.  
 
John Donvan: 
What did that look like?

Well, you know, it's hard to discern, but a quarter of his mouth turned up.  
 
John Donvan: 
So it was a clear smirk?  Phil Bobbitt.  Phil Bobbitt.  
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
I just want to point out there was U.N. Security Council resolution on Libya.  It's not -- it wasn't 
done pursuant to Congressional authorization.  It was done pursuant to a treaty.  We can 
constitutionally wage war by at least four roots, repelling a sudden attack as our opponents 
have noted, relying on the Article II power of the president, by a statute or joint resolution 
adopted by both houses of Congress, by a treaty, as in Korea or as in Libya, and by a declaration 
of war.

John Donvan: 
Let's go to some questions.  Any hands up?  Sir, right there.  So, a mic is going to come down 
the aisle to you.  If you could just hang on.  
 
Male Speaker: 
What is the substantive difference between a declaration of war and an AUMF, and is there a 
different constitutional threshold for a president's ability to drop a bomb given one or the 
other?  
 
John Donvan: 
That's -- that doesn't actually have them debating, but I like that question because it might get 
them debating on this topic, because they might disagree about the difference on that.  I'll take 
it to Deborah Pearlstein.  
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
I think maybe we might agree.  I think for present purposes especially there's no constitutional 
difference between declaring war against ISIL and authorizing the use of force against ISIL.   
 
19:43:24  
 
In either event, depending on the terms of the authorization for the use of force, Congress 
could of course impose a limitation, right?  The president can't use ground troops, for example, 
but assuming the authorization for the use of force in the statute didn't authorize anything 
different, I think they have the same effect in this case.  
 
John Donvan: 
Is there disagreement on that side?  Phil.  
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
There's a bit of a difference, as I'm sure my partners here would agree.  A declaration of war 
perfects a war.  
 
John Donvan: 
What does that mean?  
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
It's the way you perfect a lien.  It allows for additional authority, the authority to blockade 
enemy ports, to intern enemy civilians domestically.  It's -- you move from a limited war to a 
total war in international law when you perfect the war by a declaration.  That's why if you look 
back on our declared wars, they are something like total wars, and if you look at the wars that 
are done by authorizations and statutes and joint resolutions, they don't rise to that level.  And 
as my opponents know, this is a Supreme Court case, 1800, Bas v. Tingy.

Intelligence Squared U.S. 29 4/1/15 

 
John Donvan: 
Deborah Pearlstein, looking at your face maybe there is an argument there.  
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
Actually -- right, so I don't quite agree with that.  Right, so and let's take practice and current 
practice as an example, right?  We used an authorization for the use of military force, the 2001 
authorization of which Professor Amar is so fond, right, to invade Afghanistan and to detain an 
intern over the course of that war, and indeed the broader war with al-Qaeda, tens of 
thousands of prisoners.  And we repeatedly -- and Congress embraced this, the president 
embraced this, the courts have embraced it -- repeatedly invoked the international law of war, 
international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, exactly those laws.  So if we thought 
it required a declaration of war as such to do that, everything we've done more or less 
[unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
Was that not a discretionary move as opposed to a move compelled by a declaration of war?  
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
To -- 
 
John Donvan: 
To trigger international conventions, et cetera.  There was no obligation.  I would think that 
their argument is there would be no obligation.  
 
19:45:25  
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
So, the United States has an obligation under its treaty commitments, which after the supreme 
law of the land, and to observe that law of war in any armed conflict, and it would say it applied 
here.  
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Let's go to another question.  Sir.  Again, the mic will find you.  From behind you this 
one's coming, if you turn around.  Thanks.

Intelligence Squared U.S. 30 4/1/15 

This is for the group that was against the declaration.  What level of separation would you see 
from an affiliate of al-Qaeda and the perpetrators of 9/11 would you need a new authorization 
of military force?  Would it be those who were affiliated directly with 9/11 or would it be -- how 
far would you -- 
 
John Donvan: 
How different do these guys have to be from al-Qaeda before you would think that, in fact, a 
new resolution was justified? 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
I suppose if there were no evidence on which the president could make a determination, and 
that an attack on that party or that group would or could reasonably be thought to deter future 
attacks on us, if the action taken were so inappropriate or so bizarre, so farfetched, if the group 
itself had -- did not have -- has never had -- did not share the objectives, the weapon sources 
and funding with the persons and groups that aided the perpetrators, financed them and 
planned the attacks on 9/11, yes, I think that would go beyond the statute.   
 
19:46:56  
 
I'll just emphasize this one point.  When we start talking about all the crazy things the president 
might do, all the odd groups he might suddenly decide to make war on, we have not silenced 
the Congress.  We haven't stopped our political process.  When the president really does decide 
that, I don't know, the New York Yankees or Norway or something is the next associated group, 
we have ways of stopping him.  And the way we do it is not by both houses of Congress 
approving air attacks. 
 
19:47:29  
 
John Donvan: 
Gene Healy, can you respond to the first part of Philip Bobbitt's answer in which he spelled out 
a scenario in which he would think that a group that wants to do us in would require a new 
resolution because it would be different enough? 
 
Gene Healy: 
Well, the administration has changed its own criteria for what it includes in associated forces, a 
term that doesn't appear anywhere in the AUMF.  It used to require co-belligerency with al-
Qaeda.  ISIS is not a cobelligerent with al-Qaeda.  It's an organization that is not only in 
competition with al-Qaeda, but at times actively fighting al-Qaeda affiliates.  So, you know, I 
think at some point you have to read that organization out of the definition.  And they were 
concerned about the legal basis for this and how open-ended it was two years before they 
shifted to expand their own definition to allow ISIS in.  Before the --

John Donvan: 
You mean the Obama administration?

John Donvan:

Gene Healy: 
-- the Obama administration attorneys were -- there was a -- you know, from what you -- from 
what you can tell from public accounts of it, a pretty fiery debate over whether they had the 
authority, even before ISIS came on the scene, to stretch the law as far as they'd already 
stretched it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, let's go to another question.  I wanted to say that if you're not sitting in the area that has 
direct light on you, it's difficult for me to see you, but you might want to move forward.  But I'm 
going to scan again now.  Right down front here, and the mic's coming down on your right hand 
side. 
 
Male Speaker: 
If the Senate passes a new AUMF that gives the president authority to fight ISIL or ISIS, does 
that make current actions in Iraq and Syria unconstitutional or does it give them added 
authority, like you said previously, with perfecting that lien? 
 
19:49:32  
 
Akhil Amar: 
Well, I suppose -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Akhil Amar. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
-- wouldn't be just the Senate, of course.  It would be a resolution subject to the constitutional 
principles of bicameralism and presentment.  It would require the House and the Senate and 
the -- that would be presented to the president for his signature, and it would all depend on 
how it was worded.  And one of the things I believe that the administration was proposing is, 
"Maybe let's swap out the existing AUMF," which actually does not have a sunset, with one that 
would actually not merely supplement it, but supersede it, and supersede it in a way that 
actually was perhaps more limited, that did have a sunset provision, and other things.  So it all 
depends on how it would be written.

I want to remind you that we are in the question and answer section of this Intelligence

Without Congressional Authorization."  Would either of you like to respond to the points that 
were just made or move on to another question?  Deborah Pearlstein?  No? 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
No. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Another question?  Sir, right down here.  The mic is coming from your right side. 
 
19:50:41  
 
Male Speaker: 
So, Professor Bobbitt, you've alluded to the president's determination that ISIL is an affiliate or 
associate of Al-Qaeda.  Is there a standard of review here for the president? 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
Yes, I think there is.  I think that Congress is the standard.  Let me make this absolutely clear.  
There are many persons who believe that the president's Article II powers, standing alone, 
would be sufficient for him to wage war against the Islamic State: it has attacked us, it has 
attacked our aid workers, it has attacked our diplomats, it has attacked our troops, it has 
attacked our allies.   
 
19:51:26  
 
That's not the position that Professor Amar and I are taking.  There may be a lot to that, but 
that's not our view.  We want the Congress involved.  We think Congressional authorization is 
crucial.  And the real review, as you say, isn't so much judicial review.  It is congressional review.  
You've got to go back and get funds from Congress to actually fund those air strikes.  And that's 
what the president did and that's what the Congress adopted.  And we just can't get away from 
that.  I don't think we can get -- sugar coat that or airbrush it out of this debate.  We want 
congressional authorization.  We want the Congress to look at this.  We want them to say the 
president has done the appropriate thing or he hasn't. 
 
John Donvan: 
But you think it has? You think that's already done? 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
Indeed I do. Indeed I -- it's not just what I think. It's what the Congress thinks.

Gene Healy. 
 
19:52:24  
 
Gene Healy: 
There's a long history of Congress's feeling compelled to continue wars and to provide funding 
for wars that the president has launched.  In Libya, as I recall, there was no specific -- separate 
appropriation for the Libyan conflict.  It came out of the Overseas Contingency Fund.  And 
what's more, the House actually voted down authorization.  At some point, when you say the 
president can go and wage war wherever he wants and if Congress funds it, that's fine, you've 
sort of turned the Constitution on its head.  You've put all the checks that are supposed to 
stand in the way of unilateral action, and then Congress -- and then the president's action 
stands unless -- as you know, in the Vietnam War, there's an actual effort to defund it.  I think 
that puts -- that makes things exactly backwards. 
 
19:53:28  
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
Indeed. It would render -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Deborah Pearlstein. 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
-- the declare war clause and the associated clauses there, effectively moot.  If all Congress had 
to do to authorize war was appropriate funds, then why include a declare war power at all?  
What would the point of that ever be?  And we just talked about how perfecting it, in the sense 
of international law, can't be it.  In fact, the administration itself doesn't make the argument 
that the funds Congress has appropriated for military action, part of which -- a large part of 
which at the beginning was in defense of our own assets in the region, to the extent that they 
were being attacked.  The president himself says the conflict has gone much beyond that now.  
But the president himself doesn't rest on that.  He says he rests on his Article II Authority and 
then he asks Congress for additional authorization, which is why the House and Senate are 
debating the need for a new authorization now.

Philip Bobbitt: 
-- you want to talk about Libya.  I could understand why you want talk about the president.  But 
this debate is not about Libya, and the president is not here debating with Professor Amar and 
I. 
 
Gene Healy: 
Actually, this debate is about whether the president has exceeded his constitutional authority 
by waging war without Congressional authorization. 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
True.  
 
[applause]  
 
And I am quite happy to take it on that stand.  If you find that the president has exceeded 
congressional authorization, that he needs a declaration of war -- that the congressional 
authorization was ill-considered, that he is going to them now because he thinks he doesn't 
have the authority -- a charge that was just made, which is not the way I read the president's 
statements -- he's been quite clear -- 
 
Gene Healy: 
I didn't say that. 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
-- that he does not need this authority, which is the way I read it.  I'll leave it to you.  He can -- 
 
Akhil Amar: 
He already has it.

Yeah.  If you believe this -- if you believe that the funding was just a lark, it has nothing to do 
with authorizing the war, that Congress is being gulled into this, well, then you should vote for 
our opponents.

Professor Bobbitt, you have a pretty broad view of what appropriations authorize.  If I -- looking 
at the Foreign Policy article that you -- that is on the Intelligence Squared website, I believe you 
said in 2013 that the very fact that Congress funded bunker busters meant that they couldn't be 
surprised if the president decided to launch them against Syria.  Isn't that a pretty broad view of

One more question.  Sir.  
 
Male Speaker: 
Thank you.  This is for the ‘against’ side.  You seem to be saying that Congress has provided 
authority, but also should provide additional authority for strikes against ISIS.  If Congress does 
vote on a new authorization and that authorization doesn't pass, where does the president's 
authority stand at that point?  
 
19:56:38  
 
John Donvan: 
Does that change the game?  Akhil Amar.  
 
Akhil Amar: 
Well, it all depends on what it says, but our position is Congress already has spoken, and spoken 
about as clearly as it is possible to speak in the English language.  
 
John Donvan: 
So a new resolution refusing to extend the president's authority to ISIL by name would still 
leave him empowered by the 2001 authorization?  
 
Akhil Amar: 
Well, the way to change law in our system is to pass a new one, and it's possible -- it's very easy 
to pass a new resolution that passes the House and passes the Senate, and is signed by the 
president that says the 2001 authorization of the use of military force is hereby repealed, and 
section two can say, “and in its place the following shall be the rules,” and the rules could have 
tighter restrictions on scope of hostilities.

They could have sunset provisions.  They could have all sorts of stuff, just like you can have a 
new tax law or a new antitrust law, or any new statute really on any topic where Congress has 
already legislated it.  
 
John Donvan: 
Is he right about that analysis, Deborah Pearlstein?  
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
Well, is he right about, it'll depend what the new authorization says?  It'll certainly depend what 
the new authorization says, right, but part of the necessity for a new authorization, and indeed I 
think part of the reason, and I know we're not debating the administration, but the fact is even 
the president, if we are deferring to his judgment, thinks we should have a new authorization.  
Part of the purpose for that is to clarify exactly what we're doing and against whom we're doing 
it.  And I think the sort of notion that the 2001 AUMF was sufficient to get us through pretty 
much anyone in that messy Middle East because they're close enough is not only a legal error, 
it's a strategic error of the most profound sense.   
 
19:58:37  
 
We don't want to lump them together.  They're different groups, and if we do that we only 
strengthen both of them.  I think it's that strategic error that the president is most worried 
about.

three days after September 11, Congress delegated its war powers to the president in near 
perpetuity, one Congress, one vote, one time; and that that war can be conducted for decades 
to come on a need-to-know basis with minimal public debate.  You'd have to swallow the 
notion that seven months of regime change bombing in Libya isn't war for constitutional 
purposes.  It isn't even hostilities under the war powers resolution, so long as -- and this is the 
actual argument they've made, the administration that is -- it's not hostility so long as the 
country we're bombing can't easily hit us back.   
 
20:00:37  
 
That last one has what I think are pretty staggering implications in an age of remote controlled 
warfare.  It's also, I have to say, a somewhat grotesque doctrine for a humane, internationalist 
president to advance.  Put starkly, it says, "Killing a bunch of foreigners isn't war; war is what 
happens when actual Americans might get hurt.  Then it's serious.  You might even need 
congressional authorization,” unless, of course, our president thinks there's an emergency 
threat to our humanitarian values, as in Libya.  Well, our constitutional values demand debate 
and authorization before the resort to deadly force.  They demand a vote.  Tonight, please vote, 
"Yes," on the motion, "The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War 
Without Congressional Authorization."  Thank you. 
 
20:01:36  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Gene Healy. 
 
[applause] 
 
And with that being the motion, Akhil Amar, professor at Yale Law School, and author of 
"America's Unwritten Constitution:  The Precedents and Principles We Live By," is here with his 
closing statement. 
 
Akhil Amar: 
So you've heard it suggested by our distinguished opponents that the president can't go after 
ISIL because it's a different group than al-Qaeda.  And you've heard questions about, "Well, 
how similar this has to be?"  Here's at least one just very basic point that has gone unrebutted 
for the entire conversation.  Some of the leaders of ISIL were the leaders of al-Qaeda on 9/11.   
 
20:02:25  
 
And that's not true of Norway or the New York Yankees or Brooklyn or the leaders of China, for 
that matter.  So the authorization of the use of military force that Congress passed was not 
limited, didn't mention al-Qaeda by name.  It talked about other organizations that may have 
aided or harbored al-Qaeda, either before or after the fact.  It said, "Its purpose is to prevent 
future attacks."  It has no sunset provision, and yes, these folks are sometimes at odds with

each other.  Frankly, that's what winning a war means: that you want to divide the folks on the 
other side.  You want to have sufficient military strength so that they start to squabble amongst 
themselves.  That's actually how you win these conflicts and serve the ultimate purposes that 
are emphatically authorized by Congress, preventing this from happening again by affiliates of 
the same organizations that hit New York the first time. 
 
20:03:33  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Akhil Amar. 
 
[applause] 
 
And the motion is, "The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War 
Without Congressional Authorization."  And here to argue in her closing statement in support of 
the motion, Deborah Pearlstein, a Cardozo Law Professor, and former director of the Law and 
Security Program at Human Rights First. 
 
Deborah Pearlstein: 
Thank you.  So I would like to know the names of the members of ISIL that were part of al-
Qaeda when it attacked us at 9/11.  The leader of ISIL, al-Baghdadi, right, was radicalized when 
the United States invaded Iraq after 9/11, another nation that was not responsible for the 
attacks of 9/11.  I think the fundamental point as this, right?  There is a difference between al-
Qaeda and ISIL, enough of a difference that there needs to be new authorization, and the 
president himself, the expert that Professor Bobbitt suggests we look to first, agrees with that, 
which is why he has gone to Congress.   
 
20:04:35  
 
More broadly, the framers of the Constitution wanted it to be hard to go to war.  They imposed 
a series of checks in order to make it hard.  We were going to have appropriations for military 
funding in the full view of God and everyone every two years.  The Constitution requires it.  
Now we fund military operations substantially through funding contractors; through different 
departments, the funding is hidden.  They wanted citizens to be -- to serve in the military.  
These days about .5 percent of Americans serve in the military.  80 percent of us support the 
troops, 90 percent of us can't find Afghanistan on a map.  Congress and Congress's ability to 
say, "This is the war we want to fight, these are the reasons, these are the people" -- Congress 
is one of the last and most significant checks we have of limiting, constraining, in any way 
slowing the march to war that we might otherwise be inclined to take.   
 
20:05:31  
 
The president has asked Congress to help us define what that war is.  We should keep this one 
last check.  You know, I was briefing some young Congressional staffers last week on what this

would mean if they passed a new authorization.  And they despaired of Congress taking any 
action.  You can tell them, "It's not despairing.  We think you should take action."  Vote for the 
resolution in this debate. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Deborah Pearlstein.  
 
[applause]  
 
And the debate is this -- The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging 
War Without Congressional Authorization.  And here, summarizing his position against this 
motion, Philip Bobbitt, a Columbia law professor, and former director for intelligence at the 
National Security Council. 
 
Philip Bobbitt: 
Why is your vote important tonight?  It's because many people in our country have been 
thoroughly misled into doubting that of which they should be confident:  the legal basis for the 
president's actions against the Islamic State; and feel confident about widespread popular 
opinions of which they should be very dubious.  
 
20:06:40  
 
One of those opinions is, the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, Yemen, Somalia, and 
Libya have nothing to do with each other; that a global terror network is just a fantasy, full of 
sound and fury.  Another is that the Congress must adopt a declaration of war, or yet a new 
authorization, which the president does not say is required, to authorize an otherwise 
constitutional war.  Pressure groups have become quite eager to frustrate government action 
by mobilizing public opinion on the grounds that the Obama administration is acting unlawfully.  
And we've seen this in area after area.  We hope you won't be a party to this.   
 
20:07:27  
 
The interplay between the president and the Congress should not be a game that has the zenith 
of insight in the question "If that's what you meant, why didn't you say so?"  Rather, the 
strategic and moral problems we all know we face should inform on our opinions as well as our 
decisions. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Philip Bobbitt.  And that concludes closing statements in this Intelligence Squared 
U.S. debate --

-- where our motion is, "The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging 
War Without Congressional Authorization."  And now, it's time to learn which side you feel has 
argued the best.  We're going to have you again go to the keypads at your seats and vote the 
same way, same system.  Push Number one if you support this motion.  Number two if you are 
against it.  Number three if you became or remain undecided.  And you can ignore the -- as I 
said before, you can ignore the keys that are not on the screen, as they're not live.   
 
20:08:25  
 
Okay.  And while we're doing that and while the results are tabulated, I want to take a little bit 
of a break and welcome two gentlemen to the stage, and some chairs are going to miraculously 
-- well, they're not going to miraculously appear.  Two guys are going to carry them in.  
 
[laughter]  
 
They're angels.  Please welcome to the stage Jeffrey Rosen and Ed Morrison.  
 
[applause]  
 
Have a seat.  Gentlemen, the reason the two of you have been brought up here is because 
you've been partners for us.  Normally we -- as I said -- do our debates downtown, but we are 
delighted to be here at Columbia, and invited by the Richman Center, and to be in this hall 
which we've been backstage saying is actually a spectacular place to do a debate.  And Jeffrey 
Rosen, we've been partnering with you on these constitutional debates for some time, normally 
doing them in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center, which I want to say, if you have 
not been to, you should get to.  It's a short trip.  It's a spectacular place.  It's a day out.  I mean, 
it's constitutional amusement park -- constitutional Disney World.  It's really worth going to do -
- going to see.  
 
20:09:36  
 
But Jeffrey, take a minute to -- just to share with us just this whole notion that you've 
experienced, this audience has experience -- I'm sure the law professors and law students are 
used to it -- but that we're taking a slice of this thing that's about the Constitution. 
 
Jeffrey Rosen: 
Well, the National Constitution Center is constitutional heaven.  That is what it is.  And I believe 
there's nothing more important in these polarized times than citizens having the opportunity to 
hear the best arguments on the constitutional questions that are at the heart of the most 
important questions of our democracy, so that people can make up their own minds.  And 
that's the inspiring mission at the National Constitution Center was created by Congress during 
the bicentennial of the Constitution to promote.  Our congressional charter says that we have a 
mission to disseminate information about the U.S. Constitution on a non-partisan basis.  And

when I had the incredible luck of leading this amazing institution about a year-and-a-half ago, I 
decided -- I asked, "What's the leading forum for, well, intelligent debate in America?" 
 
20:10:39  
 
And of course, that's Intelligence Squared.  So I'm a law professor at GW in D.C.  I went to go 
see Nick Rosenkranz, who teaches at Georgetown, and I said we need to start a constitutional 
debate series so citizens can understand the difference between political arguments and 
constitutional arguments.  And Nick said, as you heard in his intro, that's exactly right.  There's 
nothing more important than educating people about the difference between political and 
constitutional arguments.  So we started up this incredibly series and this is the fourth debate 
we've hosted.  I'm so thrilled that it's in New York City.  And this model is so successful that it's 
become the basis for all of our constitutional education.  We've persuaded the heads of the 
Federalist Society, the leading conservative lawyers organization in the country, and the 
American Constitutional Society, the leading liberal organization to co-chair an advisory board 
of the National Constitutional Center.  Nick -- 
 
20:11:24  
 
[applause] 
 
That is worth an applause.  I think it's thrilling.  I think there's nothing more exciting than seeing 
these two great organizations joining together for civilized debate, and Nick is also co-chairing 
this board.  And last week in Washington we launched the series of a national series of town 
hall constitutional debates that I think are going to be like the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and 
transform discourse in America.  And we're having these We The People podcasts for 
constitutional debate that also bring together the top liberals and conservatives.  And we're 
creating the best interactive Constitution on the web, summoning top liberal, conservative, and 
libertarian scholars to write about every clause of the Constitution, both what they agree about 
and what they disagree about.  But for all of this our partnership with Intelligence Squared is 
the core of this model, and it's really a model of faith that believes that people are intelligent 
enough that when they hear good arguments on both sides, they'll engage, they might separate 
their political and constitutional views, they might even change their minds, and that's why I'm 
so eager to hear the vote.  I'm so thrilled to be in New York, and please join us for the next of 
our constitutional debates June 2 in Philadelphia.   
 
20:12:31  
 
Do the states have the constitutional authority to define marriage?  That debate is going to be 
right before the Supreme Court decides that question later in June, and it's going to be an 
amazing discussion, just as this one was.  
 
John Donvan: 
Also, you and Nick Rosenkranz have something else in common and it's that guy over there.

Jeffrey Rosen: 
Oh, well, Akhil Amar was my first teacher in law school and he's the greatest teacher that I've 
ever had and a great friend, and he did a great job tonight along with all the other debaters.  
 
John Donvan: 
[unintelligible] 
 
[applause] 
 
Okay.  Now it's time for Ed Morrison.  He's co-director of the Richard Paul Richman Center for 
Business, Law, and Public Policy here at Columbia.  We are delighted to be here with you, but 
why are you delighted to be here with us?  
 
[laughter] 
 
Ed Morrison: 
Well, tonight's debate is a terrific example of why we do what we do at Columbia University.  
It's why we do research.  It's why we teach.  Most, I think all of us at Columbia are here to 
engage in a deep way with policy makers, with the media, with industry -- frankly with you 
about the issues of our day.   
 
20:13:34  
 
And one of our earliest graduates, think of Alexander Hamilton, he used debates like tonight to 
shape the way an early America thought about the issues of its time.  And frankly those issues 
are not so dissimilar from what we talked about tonight.  Through his words, through his 
debates, he permanently changed the way we think about the scope of federal authority, the 
scope, the conflict between Congress and the president.  It's what we're debating tonight.  It's 
the Hamiltonian style of debate that we at Columbia crave, and yet it's all too rare.  
Newspapers want sound bites.  They call me all the time for them.  
 
John Donvan: 
And you don't give them.  
 
Ed Morrison: 
And I don't give them.  I try not to.  I'm not good at it.  The Op-Eds.  They want 300 to 500 
words.  Tweets are becoming the common currency.  That's our world, but yet then there's IQ 
Squared, and it provides the forum that I think we at Columbia crave, which is an opportunity to 
engage with you in a deep way about issues that really matter.

Weren't the questions good tonight?

They were.  They were terrific.

I have to say they're not always that good.

They were really good.  
 
Ed Morrison: 
I want to -- I'm the director of the Richard Paul Richman Center for Business Law and Public 
Policy at Columbia University.  It's a joint effort of a Law and Business School to engage with the 
public in an evidence-based, deep way -- this kind of conversation we had tonight -- and it's why 
we were just so thrilled to be able to host this kind of debate.  It's exactly what we want to 
achieve at Columbia.  And I also want to extend a thank you to Richard Richmand and Geoffrey 
Colvin, who are here tonight, whose support made this debate possible.  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you from us as well.

Gentlemen, [unintelligible]. 
 
Ed Morrison: 
One last thing.  I know I'm taking up your air time, but the last thing I want to say and I want 
you all to remember this, is that I hope tonight's debate has convinced you to come back.  
Come back to Columbia University, because we'd love to have you join us in our ongoing I think 
pretty exciting conversations about issues that matter.

John Donvan: 
And you should do the soundbites.  I mean, you're --

-- you should go with that.  Gentlemen, thank you very much.  And, again, thank you to both of 
you for [unintelligible].

One other thing about upcoming debates, I want to let you know our Intelligence Squared 
Debate series moves on.  In two weeks, April 15th, we're back at the Kaufman Center on 67th 
Street.  Our debate motion that night will be, "Abolish the Death Penalty."  And we're not doing 
that as a constitutional issue, although that will be part of it.  It's more of a social issue.  We 
would be delighted to have as many of you come down to that as you can.   
 
20:16:22  
 
Okay, so it's all in now.  I have the final results.  The motion is this, "The President Has Exceeded 
his Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization."  To remind 
you, the team whose numbers have changed the most between the first and the second votes 
will be declared our winner.  Let's look at the first vote.  In the first vote, 27 percent agreed 
with the motion, 33 percent were against, and 40 percent were undecided.  So a high number 
for us.  The second vote went like this: the team arguing for the motion, their vote went from 
27 percent to 38 percent.  They picked up 11 percentage points.  That is the number to beat.  
Let's see the side against the motion.  They went from 33 percent to 53 percent.  They picked 
up 20 percentage points.  That means the team arguing against the motion has won this 
debate, the motion being, "The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging 
War Without Congressional Authorization."   
 
[applause] 
 
Our congratulations to the team that argued against.  Thank you from me, John Donvan, at 
Intelligence Squared U.S.  We'll see you next time.  And we -- all of those invitations you have to 
all of these upcoming programs, follow through.  We'll see you there.
