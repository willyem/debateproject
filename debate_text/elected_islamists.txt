John Donvan: 
All right, so ladies and gentlemen, let's get started.  And to get to the "why now" about 
this debate, I'd like to welcome to the front seats of this stage the chairman of the board 
of Intelligence Squared U.S., Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Good evening, John. 
 
John Donvan: 
Good evening.  So what is at the heart of this particular debate tonight? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I'm reminded of a quotation I always liked from John Kenneth Galbraith.  He said 
that politics is the art of choosing between the unpalatable and the disastrous. 
 
[laughter]

And that indeed is the choice that we face in the Middle East, and it's the subject of this 
debate. 
 
John Donvan: 
So we're looking at elected Islamists versus dictatorship.  On the dictatorship side, 
what's the pro and the con on dictatorship? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, the pro of dictatorship is a lot of these dictators are fairly reliable allies of the 
United States.   
 
18:48:33 
 
The con is that they are greedy, that they stay in power with repressive means, intrusive 
security services, secret police, violence against dissent. 
 
John Donvan: 
And the pro and con of the Islamists? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, the pro of the Islamists is simply that they are elected.  And democracy is, of 
course, a core value of ours.  But we think of democracy as liberal democracy.  And what 
we see in the Middle East is what I might call -- what Fareed Zakaria called "illiberal 
democracy."  That's democracy without freedom of speech, without free exercise of 
religion, without a clear rule of law and so forth that really represent our core 
democratic values. 
 
John Donvan: 
And let's go to the "why now."  Why now for this debate? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, John, two words:  Egypt and Syria. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's Robert Rosenkranz.  Thank you, Bob.  And that's 
the shape of our debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
18:49:31 
 
Gentlemen, you can just come through the side.  And a round of applause once again for 
our debaters.

[applause] 
 
And I'd just also like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz 
because he made all of this possible. 
 
[applause] 
 
Look what happens when we add three little letters of the alphabet together.  I, S, as in 
sugar, M as in money, -i-s-m, ism.  You take that word, and you'll pin it to some perfectly 
delightful and innocent sounding nouns, and you can end up in the middle of a political 
argument.  Social, socialism; active, activism; sex, sexism .   
 
18:50:33 
 
You get the idea.  When this happens with religions, it turns a religion into a political 
movement with a political agenda.  And then you really have a debate as we do tonight, 
another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan.  Welcome.  Our 
motion is this:  "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  We have four superbly 
qualified debaters who have lived this issue for years from well before Arab Spring.  And 
they will be bringing to you their arguments for and against this motion.  Let's now meet 
our debaters.  First, Reuel Marc Gerecht is a senior fellow at the Foundation for the 
Defense of Democracies. 
 
[applause] 
 
And your partner is Brian Katulis.  He is a senior fellow at the center for American 
progress. 
 
[applause] 
 
"Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators" is our motion.  And the team arguing against 
this statement, Zuhdi Jasser, who is president of the American Islamist Forum for 
Democracy. 
 
18:51:37 
 
[applause] 
 
And your partner is Daniel Pipes who is president of the Middle East Forum. 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  And let's meet our debaters 
one by one.  Let's welcome first Reuel Marc Gerecht.  That was one of those applause 
lines.

[applause] 
 
The warmth of your reception overwhelms him, but I just want to do it one more time. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Let's meet our debaters.  Let's welcome first Reuel Marc Gerecht. 
 
[applause] 
 
And, Reuel, you are a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracy.  You 
are a former media specialist at the CIA's Directorate of Operations, now the National 
Clandestine Service.   
 
18:52:31 
 
You also have the distinction of having been on the very first panel of our Intelligence 
Squared series six years ago when the motion was, "We Must Tolerate a Nuclear Iran," 
and you were against that motion.  In the '90s, you wrote a book about your own story. 
 You wrote it under a pseudonym about your own story about getting smuggled into 
Iran.  And for our radio listeners who do not realize that you're over six feet tall, 
question is "How does somebody so big sneak into Iran?" 
 
[laughter] 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
Painfully.  I was two inches taller back then. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
On your side, also arguing for the motion, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators," 
Brian Katulis. He is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.  You have been 
studying, Brian, the Middle East since your days as undergraduate.  Actually you lived in 
Amman, Jordan, as did I a long time ago, but you were a Fulbright scholar.  I was just a 
journalist. 
 
[laughter] 
 
In the '90s you also lived in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and you were in Egypt doing 
work for the National Democratic Institution for International Affairs, and considering 
your breadth of experience and the depth of your experience as actually having lived

there, did you ever see back then that something like Arab Spring could actually 
coalesce and happen? 
 
18:53:45 
 
 
Brian Katulis: 
Absolutely.  It's like watching gravity take place.  You have a young population there, 
and what we're seeing right now is the start of something that's going to unfold for 
years to come. 
 
John Donvan: 
It was always going to happen. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
Absolutely. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Our motion is, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  And here to argue 
against that motion, I'd like to introduce Zuhdi Jasser. 
 
[applause] 
 
Zuhdi is a doctor.  He specializes in internal medicine and in nuclear cardiology.  For 11 
years you were a medical officer in the U.S. Navy.  You're a devout Muslim and founded 
the American Islamic Forum for Democracy in response to the attacks on September 11. 
 Zuhdi, you are not the first person in your family to become a political activist.  Where 
did the inspiration come from for you? 
 
18:54:31 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
Well, it really came from my grandfather.  My mom really used to say -- says actually 
frequently that it's in my genes.  He was a businessman who was active and prolific in 
writing columns in Syria and was in and out of house arrest for doing so.  And now we 
know the rest of the story of what's happening in Syria. 
 
John Donvan: 
And you come by this honorably.  Your partner. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
Thank you.

John Donvan: 
Daniel Pipes, ladies and gentlemen. 
 
[applause] 
 
And, Daniel, you are president of the Middle East Forum.  You founded it back in 1994. 
 Now, you were set off to be a quiet college professor.  You actually have two degrees in 
medieval Islamic history from Harvard.  You wrote a book on colloquial Egyptian 
grammar.  And academia beckoned, and yet, somewhere along the line you got into the 
Islam-watching game.  What happened? 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
To put it differently, the university didn't want me. 
 
[laughter] 
 
The university didn't want me because, as I like to put it, I have the politics of a truck 
driver. 
 
18:55:32 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, ladies and gentlemen, Daniel Pipes and all of our debaters. 
 
[applause] 
 
So this is a debate.  This is a contest.  These debaters are here to try to persuade you of 
the power of their arguments.  And you, our live audience, will act as the judges.  By the 
time the debate has ended, we will have asked you to vote two times, once before the 
debate and once again afterwards debate -- after the debate on the language of this 
motion, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  Let's have the first vote happen now. 
 As you come in off the street, before hearing any of the arguments, we want to know 
where you stand on this motion, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  If you agree 
with it, push number one.  If you disagree, push number two.  If you are undecided, 
push number three.  You can ignore the other keys.  And if you push a key by mistake, 
just correct yourself and the system will lock in your last vote.  Okay.  That was a piece 
of cake.  We will hold that result until the end of the debate when we have you vote a 
second time on the power of the arguments that have been persuaded.  And the team 
that has changed its numbers the most in the course of the evening will be declared our 
winner.

So on to round one, opening statements from each of our debaters in turn.  And 
speaking first in support of the motion, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators," Reuel 
Marc Gerecht.  He is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.  He 
served as a specialist in the CIA's Directorate of Operations and is the author of several 
books, including "The Wave: Man, God, and the Ballot Box in the Middle East."  Ladies 
and gentlemen, Reuel Marc Gerecht. 
 
[applause] 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
It's a pleasure to be here.  Last time I did IQ Squared in London, I actually laughed so 
hard during the debate, I pulled a muscle on stage.  I will endeavor to be more 
restrained this evening.  I also notice that it's impossible they didn't give me a glass of 
wine.  In London you could actually drink wine will you did the debate.   
 
18:57:31 
 
So let me just say, one, it's an honor to be here with Daniel Pipes.  I read Daniel's 
dissertation -- I think it was over 30 years ago now -- on slave soldiers, which actually is a 
very important and unappreciated part of Islamic history.  Daniel and I have actually 
debated this issue years ago, when a little book I put out called "Islamic Paradox" came 
out.  So it's good to be here with him again.  
 
And let me sort of restate the resolution.  I think what Daniel and Zuhdi are really saying 
is that better dictatorship forever than allow the Muslim common man, woman to elect 
Islamists in a free vote.  Now, that's a pretty, I think, ironic position for them to take, 
because what they're essentially saying is they want to perpetuate the political systems 
which have allowed Islamic fundamentalism, including its most radical offshoots, 
jihadism, most famously al-Qaida, to actually grow stronger.   
 
18:58:42 
 
It is no accident that Islamic radicalism has grown enormously during the period of 
dictatorship, secular dictatorship, throughout much of the region.  It has been jet fuel 
for that cause.  The societies that have been ruled by dictators and kings with ever 
coarsening, I think, rigor have very -- have harmed their societies, have caused, more or 
less, an ethical collapse.  
 
I mean, a good personal anecdote of this is when I was in Cairo and I was a student 
there at the American University of Cairo in 1980.  I can say that not a single woman at 
that school was veiled.  And that was a good thing, because they were babes.  I mean, 
they were hot.  I've never seen so many beautiful women in one spot.   
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

18:59:33 
 
And 20 years later, I think it's fair to say, under Mubarak, that probably 20 percent, or 
even more maybe, were veiled.  Now, why is it the social composition of that school 
hasn't changed at all, these are women of the elite.  Why would women of the elite 
actually start veiling themselves?  Because they should be the ones who should embrace 
the dictatorship because it has allowed them certain social liberties that would not exist 
under an Islamist system.  I think the answer to that is that they were protesting.  They 
were protesting the political order.  They were protesting the social order.  They were 
protesting the ethical order, that it had become disgusting.  
 
And I think if you -- it's interesting to then- to look North and look at where, I think, 
Daniel, and perhaps Zuhdi too, would once upon a time have said were the best hope 
for the Islamic world, and that would be Turkey.   
 
19:00:31 
 
All right?  Because Turkey really had the model that everybody in the foreign policy 
community on the left and the right really liked.  That was the model that you would 
have enlightened dictatorship.  You have someone like Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.  He 
would come in and, through force of arms, literally, change the society, create the social 
basis for a more liberal order, and, boom, down the pike you would have liberal 
democracy.  Now, guess what's happened in Turkey?  You haven't seen the triumph, 
actually, of liberals yet in the ballot box.  For the last almost 10 years, you've seen the 
Islamist party win.  As the elections became ever freer, as the generals moved off, guess 
who became the dominant party, the AKP, the Justice and Development Party, which is 
an Islamist -- I think Daniel would call it an Islamist party. 
 
So what that ought to tell you is that under no circumstances are you going to create a 
liberal order in the Middle East without bringing along the faithful.  You cannot have a 
dictatorship who will take the traditions of the past and will take the ulama, the 
religious scholars, and throw them in the dust bin or throw them in jail.   
 
19:01:38 
 
The only way you're going to get a more liberal order in the Middle East is through 
people of faith.  It is through the fundamentalists participating in the system that you're 
actually going to develop the jousting ethic that is going to allow liberals to have greater 
chances.  It's only through them participating that you're going to have people become 
responsible for politics.  Now, Daniel – another good book that Daniel wrote was 
actually about conspiracy.  And if all those who know the Middle East at all, you know 
that the Middle East is hobbled by conspiracy.  It's known as toovtdie [spelled 
phonetically].  In Persian, they call it toovtdie jewy [spelled phonetically] conspiracy 
mongering, searching for conspiracies.  It is literally, as Daniel would tell you, it's a 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

cancer on society.  Now, why do they have that?  They have that because the political 
order is dictatorial.   
 
19:02:33 
 
It is what -- everything that is important that happens happens, as the Iranians say, 
pushte powde [spelled phonetically], it happens behind the curtain.  Only by people 
becoming responsible, by having, as they say in the Arabic and in Persian, masuliat 
[spelled phonetically], can you drive away conspiracy, can you create a more healthy 
order.  There's no way you can have that under dictatorship.  You are always going to 
have dependent people.  You're always going to have people who are ridden with 
conspiracy.  So if you want to create that order, perpetuate that order, what Daniel is in 
fact saying is he's going to create an order, there's going to be more conspiracy.  It is you 
have to bring in some type of Democratic system and allow these people to evolve.  And 
they might also say evolution is not possible with Islamists.  Well, we know, at least 
looking in the case of Iran -- and we don't know yet what's going to happen in the Arab 
world.  We don't know what's going to happen in Egypt.  We don't know what's going to 
happen in Tunisia.  But we can tell that in Iraq under a theocracy, under a dictatorship, 
there has been a profound change that you have fallen revolutionaries everywhere.   
 
19:03:40 
 
I do not have time to go into the number of them, but it is an ocean.  It is a tidal wave of 
people who were once hard core Islamists who have abandoned the faith or who have 
evolved their faith and have become pretty profound Democrats, if not liberals.  They 
still exist in the dictatorial society.  But they are -- you have seen the explosions in 2007. 
 You saw them in 2009.  You saw it in 1997, Mohammed Akbi [spelled phonetically].  So I 
suggest to you if you want to see evolution, you cannot be in favor of -- create a 
dictatorship which can only promise you stagnation.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Reuel Marc Gerecht. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Our motion better is "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  And here to argue his 
position against the motion, Daniel Pipes.  He is president and founder of the Middle 
East Forum which publishes the Middle East Quarterly and sponsors Campus Watch, 
Islamist Watch and The Legal Project.   
 
19:04:38 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 -

He's the author of 12 books.  And his biweekly columns are read around the world. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, Daniel Pipes. 
 
[applause] 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Thank you, John.  And let me return the compliment to Reuel.  I learned much from his 
books on Iran and particularly the book that was alluded to before his entry, his 
smuggling -- being smuggled into Iran.  He has certainly got us off to a rousing start. 
 Now, the good news, ladies and gentlemen, is that we basically agree on the 
fundamentals.  None of us like dictators.  We all want liberal democracy.  None of us like 
conspiracy theories.  So the question is not one of principle.  The question is really one 
more of tactics.  How do we achieve liberal democracy in the Middle East?  And as 
you've just heard, the argument for elected Islamists is that this flushes out the system, 
and you have responsibility, and you have progress.  I will argue the opposite case, not 
because I'm against responsibility and progress but because I think that the Islamists, 
whether elected or not, whether violent or not, Islamists of any sort whatsoever are 
barbarians, are totalitarians, are far worse than dictators.   
 
19:05:51 
 
You're not going to look to me to find an apologetics for dictators.  They're execrable, 
they're horrible, they're brutal, they're miserable.  But the Islamists, elected or not, are 
even worse.   
 
One can distinguish between those dictators who are greedy.  In fact, Robert 
Rosenkranz used that very word before.  They're greedy.  They're interested in their 
own welfare.  They have huge amounts of money stored away.  They invite Mariah 
Carey in to sing their birthday song.  They keep pet lions in their backyard.  They have 
lots of cars and planes.  It's the good life.  They're greedy.   
 
19:06:32 
 
And in the pursuit of this greedy goal, they are going to harm you if you get in their way. 
 But if you don't get in their way, they'll leave you alone.  They don't have a vision.  They 
don't particularly cooperate with each other.  And they often do cooperate with us 
because they don't have any particular hostility towards us so long as we don't get in 
their way.  Now, that's bad.  There's no apology from me on that.  But the ideological 
dictators, be they fascist, communist or Islamist are far worse because they wish to 
impose their vision.  They wish to create a global hegemonic state, in this case, 
Caliphate, another case, an international communist state or Nazi state.  They have a 
vision for the new human being who they will redo.  And if you get in their way, they will 
-- even if you don't get in their way, if you disagree with them, they will be brutal with 
you.   



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
19:07:29 
 
And if dictators are bad and kill thousands, ideological dictators, Nazis, communists and 
Islamists kill millions and even tens of millions, tens of millions.  Mao, Stalin, Saddam 
Hussein and so forth.  These are people with a vision how they're going to change 
society.  So I argue that we're better off with plain old greedy dictators who can evolve, 
who do evolve if they're pushed, who are not that terrible to their population, who we 
can work with.  We're far better off with them than we are with the ideological ones.  So 
in short, the motion that's before us, "Better --" if you agree with this motion, "Better 
Elected Islamists Than Dictators," you are in effect saying that you also agree with the 
idea that the motion, "Better Elected Nazis Than Dictators.”  Adolph Hitler was elected, 
was he not?  These are the same people.  These are totalitarianists.   
 
19:08:34 
 
These are people who will limit freedom for a much longer period of time.  Now, it's 
true, as Reuel pointed out, that in 1980, one did not see the Islamist surge in Egypt that 
one does today.  No question.  And I agree with him that the dictatorship was part of it. 
 I wish that our government and other Western governments had pushed Hosni 
Mubarak to open up.  And I believe we could have had a quite different outcome had 
we done so.  We were irresponsible in being his colluders, his accomplices.  We should 
have been pushing towards civil society.  We should have been pushing towards voting 
and freedom of expression and minority rights and independent judiciary and loyal 
opposition.  We should have been doing all those things, and we didn't.  And thus we 
have the terrible results we have.  So my first premise, my first guideline for American 
policy is always deal with dictators and push them in the right direction towards an open 
society.   
 
19:09:39 
 
Secondly, always support our friends.  We do have friends.  We do have people who 
agree with us.  Be they the demonstrators in Iran in June of 2009 who were against the 
dictatorship of the Mullahs or the people in Tahrir Square last year who were against 
Mubarak.  If you listen to them, they're in favor of the things we have.  They want 
democracy.  They want civil society.  They want responsibility.  And it is our burden not 
only to help them materially but to help them morally, to work with them, to always, 
always help them.  Even though they're far from the corridors of power and will not 
achieve -- will not reach rule any time soon, they are the hope for the Middle East.  They 
are the ones who can pull the region out of its current mire, and we must always 
support them.   
 
19:10:28 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 -

So one, work with dictators, but push them towards civil society and democracy.  Two, 
always help the liberal elements.  And three, always, always, always oppose the 
Islamists.  They are our worst enemy.  And whenever they come in, they are our enemy, 
and they are the enemy of the subjects that they rule over.  And Reuel mentioned 
Turkey.  Yeah, Turkey has become Islamist, as he mentioned.  For the last 10 years, one 
sees a Turkey which was always imperfect under the other parties, has under the AKP 
become far more dictatorial than it had been for, far more hostile in its foreign relations 
with state actors, states on its peripheries, has the largest number of journalists in the 
world that are in jail and the like.  So in short, if we want to get to liberal democracy, 
which we all agree upon, the thing to do is to work with the dictators and improve the 
dictators and slam the door on the totalitarians and the ideological dictators.   
 
19:11:31 
 
Work with the greedy dictators and slam the door on the ideological dictators who will 
put the region into even worse shape than it is today.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Daniel Pipes. 
 
[applause] 
 
A reminder of what's going on.  We are halfway through the opening statements of this 
Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four debaters, two teams 
of two fighting it out over this motion:  "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  You 
have heard two of the opening arguments, and now onto the third.  I'd like to introduce 
Brian Katulis.  He is a fellow at the Center for American Progress.  He has served as a 
consultant to numerous government agencies, private corporations, non-governmental 
organizations, on issues related to the Middle East and South Asia.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, Brian Katulis. 
 
[applause] 
 
Brian Katulis: 
Thank you.  It's really great to be here tonight, and I can promise in this debate we're 
not going to talk about the debt, I'm not going to talk about my grandmother, I'm not 
going to talk about your tax rates, we've got a really juicy topic.   
 
19:12:33 
 
And I'm going to break it down into three main points, why you should vote in favor of 
the proposition and not against us.  Number one, no dictatorship can maintain the 
status quo that we see in the Middle East right now.  A vote for the proposition would 
be a vote to accept reality.  A vote against the proposition is a vote to stick your headiu 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

in the sand.  Although I suspect much of the debate tonight will focus on the Middle East 
and North Africa, it's important to note that this region of the world actually represents 
a minority in the vast Muslim world.  It's about 20 percent of the entire population of 
Muslims in the world.  Six in 10 Muslims actually live in the Asia-Pacific region.  Muslim 
majority countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have activist Islamist political parties and 
systems that work.  So the debate over whether Islam and democracy is compatible is 
the persistent charm of an irrelevant question, one that's no longer relevant.   
 
19:13:33 
 
In the Middle East right now we're in the very early stages of a transition that I think will 
last for years.  And a year and a half into these uprisings we've only seen four leaders fall 
out of about 19 or 20, depending how you add them up.  And you've seen only serious 
infighting in the five or six countries, but you look at the crushing demographic political 
and economic conditions that these countries face, no dictator can hold that back.  And I 
think you look at the political dynamics in places like Egypt and Tunisia, it's quite natural 
to see why Islamists did very well for reasons that were well explained.  They were 
suppressed, and the debates in these societies were pushed to the dark corners of the 
mosques.  And that debate was radicalized, and, yes, there is a threat from radicalized 
Islam.  But it is the consequence of dictatorships, the very thing that if you vote against 
the proposition you will be voting in favor of that and continuing that sort of system.   
 
19:14:29 
 
It's simply not sustainable.  Number two, elected Islamists will change in response to the 
politics.  And I think tonight we'll talk a lot about statements that elected Islamists will 
say.  What I'm focused on are the people, and I lived over there, and I understand that 
the basic needs, basic security, jobs, and other things will drive politics, maybe not in 
the early stages, maybe when things get a little rough they'll be a little ideological, but, 
by and large, Islamist politicians will be politicians, and we will need to support this long 
effort to actually push them to face the same pressures and constraints that other 
politicians face around the world.  And the open debates that we have like the open 
debate we're having here tonight in Intelligence Squared, I think this forum is 
phenomenal.  I've watched it now a number of times.  And these sorts of open debates 
expose the voices of fear, expose the voices of hatred and demonization in ways that I 
think clarify.   
 
19:15:34 
 
And this is what these societies in the Middle East are just starting to experience.  So, 
again, a vote for the proposition is a vote for the possibility of change in these societies. 
 A vote against it, it's for the status quo, which, as we said, is unsustainable and has 
harmed us.  Now, I hope we get into this debate over a liberal democracy.  You talked 
about it a little bit early on.  And certainly we shouldn't be naïve.  There's a very real risk 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 -

that if we simplistically define democracy as the ballot box and going to the ballot box, 
you could see Christian minorities, other religious minorities, women see their rights 
suffer.  But my argument, again, against that and against the arguments of one man, 
one vote, one time, which is often brought up, is that that threat in the context of this 
debate tonight, the proposition you have to vote for or against, there's an inherent 
contradiction there, because if the biggest threat resulting from elected Islamists is a 
dictatorship that imposes upon the human rights and basic rights of individuals, you've 
got a dictatorship. 
 
19:16:39 
 
So at the core of the argument of our opponents tonight is that contradiction we need 
to deal with.  Third point, elected Islamists, not dictators, will defeat the radical 
ideologies of groups like al-Qaida.  Now, I think we've done a damn good job over the 
last three or four years going after al-Qaida, and I know that's a debatable proposition 
among a lot of people.  But I think the targeted strikes and other things, that's a 
separate debate, which I hope Intelligence Squared has.  But if you look at what's going 
on ideologically in the battle of ideas, al-Qaida, over the last three decades, essentially, 
has tried to build its ideological platform on two core pillars.  Number one, tapping the 
popular discontent with dictators.  Number two, anti-Americanism.  That's a 
combustible mix, and breaking that, and having the people in the region break that, I 
think, is extremely powerful.   
 
19:17:36 
 
The fact that al-Qaida and its affiliates had virtually nothing with the removal of leaders 
in places like Egypt and Tunisia and the widespread calls for political reform and the 
battles that are still going, I think, is telling.  The fact that Ayman Zawahiri, the head of 
al-Qaida, wrote a book attacking the Muslim Brotherhood for actually participating in 
democratic politics is telling.  Looking ahead, it seems that al-Qaida's popular appeal, I 
think, will remain low, given that many of the protesters are out there supporting 
democratic reforms.  People are going to the ballot box, the very thing that radical 
jihadists are opposed to. 
 
So I'm going to close up here.  I must say that we're faced with a great opportunity here. 
 The popular uprisings in the Middle East.  And, again, we'll probably focus on that, 
because it's the hot topic, and it's the most uncertain, and Reuel and I agree that there's 
no clear path forward.  And I think we're probably going to have a couple of steps back.   
 
19:18:31 
 
We're going to see these countries fight with this all along.  But tonight, if you vote 
against this motion, your vote is essentially saying -- remember those good old days 
when Muammar Gaddafi was in power in Libya?  Remember those good old days? 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 Remember when he repressed and killed thousands of his own citizens, when he 
actually used the veil of Islamism at different times and passed laws in the name of 
Islam to try to establish his credibility?  Remember Muammar Gaddafi used terrorists 
who actually bombed airlines and killed hundreds of Americans around the world, 
setting off the sorts of things that I think we're debating here tonight.  Remember that? 
 Then vote against the proposition.  A vote for the proposition, is it a clear, certain 
proposition that we're going to see liberal democracy appear?  I can't guarantee you 
that.  But I actually think it's a better pathway forward than sticking with dictatorships. 
 Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Brian Katulis. Our motion is, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  And 
our final debater against the motion, Zuhdi Jasser.   
 
19:19:33 
 
Zuhdi is the founder and president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy.  He is 
also a doctor and a former medical officer in the U.S. Navy.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
Zuhdi Jasser. 
 
[applause] 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
Thank you, John.  It's a privilege and honor to be here.  And thank you, Mr. Rosenkranz, 
for your vision and this wonderful platform.  Daniel covered the history and the choices 
before us in the Middle East.  I'll give you a deeper, more personal analysis of, really, 
one of the terms that I think has been thrown around here quite a bit, but, yet, it 
doesn't seem that our opposition understands, which is Islamism.  And this motion, I 
cannot tell you enough, as a Muslim and as an American, how important it is that we 
not get this wrong, because we're sitting right now at a tipping point in the Middle East, 
and if we get this wrong and we start to think, "Well, the Islamists are better than the 
dictators," we're going to then usher in even worse totalitarianism and dictatorship. 
 
19:20:30 
 
You know, one of the old sayings was that hope springs eternal.  And certainly one of 
the American concepts we've always had is that we want to be hopeful; we want to see 
progress.  But I'll tell you, as a Muslim, I'm insulted at people who believe that Islamism 
is progress for me as a Muslim, that somehow the theocrats and those with robes that 
memorize their scripture, that somehow know how to run democracy, when, in fact, it's 
an illusion.  I think one of the things our opposition hasn't even begun to tell you is how 
they can trust one word that the Islamists tell them.  They're deceptive theocrats who 
will do anything to monopolize and control our societies.  
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And I think one of the things our opposition seems to be doing -- and if you vote for this 
motion, you'd be basically voting for the fact that, somehow, they want you to believe 
that we support dictators.  And that's not why I'm on this side.  I'm on this side of this 
equation because Islamists are not better than dictators, because we have been 
sentenced to two evils in the Middle East: Islamic fascism and secular fascism.   
 
19:21:33 
 
They both supported one another.  They fed off one another.  They're one and the 
same.  And for our opposition to tell you that, somehow, boom, the dictators exit stage 
left, and what you're left with is a spring that you can plant new plants and soil, and 
somehow that the Islamists, that somehow they come out of reform, is just hogwash. 
 The Islamists are a product of dictatorship, as, actually, they said.  So now, all of a 
sudden, we're going to put our hope for reform into not only people the people that 
came out of that environment, but people that have thrived in monopolizing and 
feeding off of a dictatorial mindset.  But add one more very important component, a 
sense that they have a mandate from God, a sense that they know our faith.  They know 
Islam, and they know how to put into place Sharia or Islamic law, and they will do it not 
only for their country, they'll do it for the 56 other countries in the OIC, the Organization 
of the Islamic Cooperation, and they'll thus do it for the world.   
 
19:22:33 
 
This is far more dangerous than a simple dictator.  So you need to understand what 
Islamism is if you're going to vote for or against this motion.  And once you understand 
that Islamism is no different than what our Founding Fathers fought against when we 
fought against theocracy in this country, you'll realize that fighting against theocracy is 
the only way to achieve liberty.  And I as a Muslim who loves my faith and loves my 
scripture, if I want to see our societies -- I mean, listen, my family fought against 
dictatorship in Syria.  We understand what it is.  And you see it today with over 30,000 
killed and hundreds of thousands of displaced.  But American influence -- please don't 
underestimate the influence that America can have if we try to tip this equation one 
way or the other.  And if you believe that there's a third pathway for Muslims and for all 
those minorities and women and others in the Middle East, then you must vote against 
this motion.   
 
19:23:30 
 
You must vote that Islamists are not better than dictators.  They come from the same 
cloth.  And Islamists actually -- actually are dictators on steroids.  You know, ultimately, I 
think we have to remember that if you're going to vote with the opposition for this 
motion, you're going to believe that somehow you can have hope with Islamists.  Forget 
what they say, forget what they believe.  Forget what the mantra is of the Muslim 
Brotherhood.  Forget what they are saying from their pulpits, what they are saying from 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

the government.  Forget that the OIC just last week gave us directions on how to deal 
with our own First Amendment that it's too critical of Islam and Muslims.  Forget the 
fact that women have less and less rights the more the clerics get in control.  Forget the 
fact that the minorities are ousted, the fact that the Jewish population and Coptics and 
others, the more Islamists get in control, the more minorities vacate the premises in 
those countries.   
 
19:24:29 
 
Somehow we need to divorce ourselves from the reality of what Islamists do and say 
that they're a gateway into a future of hope for the Middle East.  That's certainly not a 
gate that I want to walk through.  And it's certainly, I don't think, a gate that the people 
that are giving their lives in the Arab revolutions, in the Arab Spring, which are really just 
convulsions against dictators, the people that are marching on the streets are not doing 
that to be handed over to Islamists.  And if they did -- if you vote for this motion, you 
are basically telling them that, okay, this dictator, this theocrat, because he uses 
religious language, is better for you.  And we're going to help them.  And by the way, if 
you believe in American credibility and soft power, American soft power in the Middle 
East is lower than it's ever been.  The reason Secretary Clinton had tomatoes thrown at 
her car a few months ago was because the people of the Arab Spring saw us helping out 
the Brotherhood, saw us basically cozying up to the Islamists.  And the Islamists did not 
win that election.  They only got 25 percent of the vote, and then there was a runoff.   
 
19:25:33 
 
So remember the elections, that's the other part of this motion.  We have to also look at 
what it means to be elected.  The non-Islamists are divided into so many parties that the 
majority, 75 percent of Egypt and a majority of Tunisians did not vote with the Islamists 
the first time around.  But then when a runoff happened, they ended up voting between 
the Islamists or the old dictators, and they wanted some kind of change shall and they 
ended up voting for the Islamists.  So that's the other thing is, if you want to resign them 
to just two choices, both of which none of us want, I think ultimately you must vote for. 
 If you want to give them a third choice, a third path, that being of liberty, I believe you 
should vote against.  And you'll not see the Egypt Islamist President Morsi, for example, 
criticizing terrorist groups like Hamas or Iran or Saudi Arabia, even though he may give 
flowery language of parliamentary democracies and talking about women's rights, et 
cetera.   
 
19:26:28 
 
But yet when push comes to shove -- just a few years ago, he was a truther, a conspiracy 
theorist.  Just a few years ago -- and just actually a few months ago, he's already met 
with the heads of Hamas and other radical Islamists.  So this is a guy who's consolidating 
his power, not only in Egypt, but globally.  Islamism is what pushes him to consolidate 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

power globally.  And I think this is why you should vote against the motion.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Zuhdi Jasser.  And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. 
debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
So now we go on to round two.  And round two is where the debaters address one 
another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in the audience.  Our 
motion is this:  "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  Arguing for the motion, we 
have Reuel Marc Gerecht and Brian Katulis.  They have been arguing that you need to 
bring these guys into the political process because, number one, it's happening anyway. 
  
 
19:27:30 
 
Dictators are in free fall.  They're doomed.  These people are the political process.  They 
represent the faithful.  The faithful represent this community.  And that once in power, 
they will evolve the responsibility of having to serve the needs of people and clothe and 
shelter them, will cause them to evolve, to separate into factions, and that their 
societies will gradually open.  The side arguing against the motion, Daniel Pipes and 
Zuhdi Jasser are arguing that Islamists are -- cannot be reformed, that they are 
intolerant, they are barbaric, they are totalitarian, far worse than any dictator, that they 
are deceptive and will do anything they can to stay in power.  I want to put to the side 
arguing for the motion a premise that has been brought up by your opponent, Daniel 
Pipes, essentially saying that the -- and these -- this team is clearly not pro-dictator. 
 They're not celebrating dictatorship.  They don't like it.  They're talking about a lesser of 
two evils.  And in making that argument, they make the case that at least dictators can 
be worked with.   
 
19:28:34 
 
It's a single individual, I assume is part of your argument.  The U.S. may have leverage 
over dictators in some cases, that they can be worked with, and change can come about 
that way.  And I'd like the side arguing against them in support of elected Islamists to 
take that on.  Reuel Marc Gerecht. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
Yeah.  It's pretty hard to find an instance where you can find the United States 
successfully encouraging a dictatorship to evolve liberally in the Middle East.  Daniel 
said, "I wish we had."  Well, of course I wish we had.  I wish we had taken the Shah -- 
had we put more pressure on him so he could have evolved and developed elections so 
you wouldn't have had a revolution.  I mean, I just have to say this, Daniel's premise is 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

that by the mighty hand of the United States, we're going to discover these hidden 
liberals in the Middle East.  And suddenly, through America's nurturing, these liberals 
are going to come forward and defeat the people of faith.   
 
19:29:31 
 
I just don't -- that's not the Middle East I know.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  You 
cannot import into the Middle East liberal ideas and liberal codes of justice, Swiss legal 
codes and create liberals.  It has to come organically. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
It has to be through the ballot box. 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel Pipes. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
But we did do that.  We did that in Turkey, for example.  We pushed the Turks away 
from the autocracy that they had in the '40s towards the pretty good democracy of the 
1990s.  And we've done it around the world.  I grant you -- 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
And who won the election? 
 
John Donvan: 
Marc, let him finish. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
-- we've done it less in the Middle East than elsewhere.  But let me mention, for 
example, South Korea or Taiwan or Brazil.  There are many places around the world 
where we have done that.  And we didn't do it in Egypt, and that's a big mistake we 
made.  But Brian suggested that we're advocating for stagnancy.  But I think you heard 
me loud and clear.  And Reuel just quoted me.  I wanted to push -- today I want to push 
in Algeria and Morocco and Saudi Arabia, I want to push.   
 
19:30:30 
 
I want them to open up. 
 
John Donvan: 
But I think they're saying that -- that in this case in the Middle East, they cannot be 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

pushed. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Of course they can. 
 
John Donvan: 
Are you saying that they cannot be pushed successfully? 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
No, I think you can push.  But let's just take Turkey.  I mean, Turkey is the ideal.  They 
elected an Islamist party.  I mean, what would you have done differently in Turkey?  As 
you just said, the 1990s created a more liberal order.  Guess what happens?  The people 
freely vote and bring in the Islamists.  So I don't see -- if Turkey's not going that way, 
how is Egypt, which is far less Westernized, which has been much farther from the 
European tradition. 
 
John Donvan: 
Brian, hang on a second.  Zuhdi Jasser. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
Yeah, you continue to use the old paradigm as if somehow all we have is to look 
backwards.  And I think if there's any message from the Arab Spring, it's please stop 
looking backwards at the old and look at the new in that the Arab Spring was a 
grassroots revolution.  It wasn't about the old either clerics or the dictators.  There are 
new choices there.  This was a Facebook revolution, YouTube revolution, Twitter.  It was 
about communications on the ground.   
 
19:31:29 
 
The Islamists then hijacked the revolution.  And now you want to hand it over to them 
as if there're no liberals on the ground.  And I think it's insulting to the Middle East 
population to say that there're no liberals -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
-- that there're no liberals on the ground.  I've read hundreds of those leaders and 
scholars.  But they've just either been in jail or suppressed by both of the ones you want 
us to believe. 
 
John Donvan: 
Brian Katulis. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Brian Katulis: 
Well, I think the notion that we could work with dictators today in 2012 and pressure 
them and things like this, it's quaint to me.  It sounds like the Cold War.  It sounds like a 
20th century idea that worked back then but doesn't understand statecraft as it is 
today, doesn't understand power as it is today.  And I think we see this on full display 
with our colleagues here who are debating against this motion.  Zuhdi equated fighting 
against theocracy with fighting against elected Islamists.  And I’ve got to tell you, there's 
a big gap between those two.  And I also got to tell you that I think when I listen to them 
present their arguments, not only do they think that the people of the Middle East are 
foolish and will just listen to elected Islamists and reelect them blindly, I think they think 
you're foolish tonight because I think the biggest argument that could be made is --  
 
19:32:38 
 
-- and it's not about the leaders or what Morsi says and what he might not say -- when I 
see Egypt today, Egypt after Mubarak is an Egypt where there're multiple centers of 
power that are competing for this.  And they're fighting with each other.  And, yes, 
Islamists did well in the first round of elections.  But guess what?  I actually think in the 
next round of elections you're going to see even more competitive space here.  You stick 
with dictatorships, you don't let Islamists go out there and make fools of themselves in 
the way that I think elected democracies open up that space -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
-- then we're going to have the same old, same old. 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel Pipes. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
You see an Egypt that's got lots of contending centers of power.  I see an Egypt where 
the Coptic population is increasingly being repressed, murdered, emigrating as it never 
has before.  I see a population where women are being repressed as they never have 
been before.   
 
19:33:31 
 
I see a country where the Sharia, a medieval law code, is being dredged out and applied. 
 And you call us "quaint"?  You're advocating for a medieval code. 
 
[applause] 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Brian Katulis: 
Can I -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me let Marc address that. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
Yeah, I mean, one, the Sharia has been the rule of law for much of the Egyptian 
population all over the place for decades now.  
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait, can you -- one sentence, on what do you mean by that. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
In the sense that the central governing structure had collapsed.  It wasn't there.  I mean, 
one reason the Islamic fundamentalists were to come -- able to come in and have such 
growth is because the social order from the central government, it just basically ceased 
to exist and also because there are a lot of Egyptians out there who don't have a 
problem with much of the holy law.  And I don't think you get to take the holy law, as 
tried -- as you tried to do in other places in the Middle East, and just suddenly throw it -- 
Ben Ali tried to do it, just take it, throw it away -- you have to have it organically evolve.   
 
19:34:32 
 
There is no other way, and I think you will.  I mean, you suggest with Mubarak that you 
could have nudged him.  But every time we tried to nudge Mubarak -- and the American 
government did try to nudge Mubarak -- he would say, "If not me, then the Islamists." 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
So, Reuel -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Zuhdi Jasser. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
-- the way to make that organically evolve is not for the United States to side with the 
Islamists.  The way to make it evolve is to side with the liberals that want Democratic 
change that speak out against theocracy.  I mean, actually, I think what you've all been 
ignoring from -- if you're for the motion, what you're ignoring is the fact that the 
Islamists you want us to support are byproducts of these dictators.  The fact that 
Mubarak housed the Brotherhood, Al Azhar University flourished under him, the 
Wahabis flourished under the monarchy of Saudi Arabia, Hamas had headquarters 
under Assad and Syria.  So to say that somehow these people just sort of accidentally 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

got along pretty well with dictators until their revolutions happened, and now that the 
Islamists found a way in, they're finally turning over the dictators that used to feed them 
for so long.   
 
19:35:30 
 
In fact, it's the third path.  If you really want liberal democrats to rise, you can't as the 
most powerful country -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me ask this side, something that Zuhdi just said, he said that these Islamists, that you 
want us to support.  Is that accurate?  You want us to support Islamists? 
 
Brian Katulis: 
It's absolutely incorrect.  We're not saying vote for these Islamists.  We're saying, "Vote 
for the possibility of competition in these politics."  And that's an oversimplification right 
there.  And I think it's an oversimplification to say that this current U.S. administration 
supported Islamists over any other thing.  They've supported the openness and people 
having a voice in their own debates. 
 
John Donvan: 
Is there a distinction -- let me go to this side -- if people will vote for Islamists, is that the 
will of the people being expressed? 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
I don't believe so. 
 
John Donvan: 
[inaudible] 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
You can't know what the will is.  Sayid Ibrahim [spelled phonetically] said in the Wall 
Street Journal -- he said, "please give us four or five years until we have elections 
because the liberals need time to get infrastructure, to get institutions, and the people 
that would get legs now are only more of the old.  And the Islamists came out of 
Mubarak and all the dictators before -- 
 
19:36:35 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
[unintelligible] make a quick response to that. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 -

John Donvan: 
[inaudible] 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
My old friend and teacher, Olivier Roy, made the -- I thought the pithy remark where he 
said, "If France had to wait for the development of a democratic culture, France would 
still be a monarchy."  The notion that you are somehow going to push off into the 
distance four or five years, and you get to four or five years, another four or five years, 
that you're going to have suddenly liberals become strong and the dominant party I 
think isn't serious. 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel Pipes. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
Ayman Nour couldn't win an election in Egypt right now if the CIA had paid every single 
Egyptian $5,000. 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel Pipes. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
It wouldn't have happened. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
I find it curious that Zuhdi and I are celebrating -- let's call them the liberals, the 
moderns, in Egypt and the rest of the Middle East, and you two are denigrating them 
and ignoring them.  These are the hope.  Why don't you put your faith in them?  ' 
 
19:37:29 
 
Why do you put your faith in people who have a code and a vision that is as antithetical 
to ours as could -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I don't think -- let me just -- let me just clarify something.  I don't think I hear them 
saying -- that's why I asked the question before, that they're putting their faith in the 
Islamists, but that they're putting their faith in the openness of the process, which is 
different. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Brian just said that when the Islamists come to power, they moderate, to which I would 
say, "Yeah?  Tell me about Iran."  Where's the moderation in Iran?  I see no moderation.

 I see, in fact, a more vicious government -- 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
Well, Iran came to power through a revolution.  It was a revolution against the Shah.  I 
mean, it was a complete, total overthrow, in fact, within a very short -- the thing that 
you would want to ask in Iran is, have the individuals who initially supported Khomeini, 
who supported the idea of theocracy, had an enormous change?  You have.  You can't 
find a halfway intelligent cleric who actually supports the idea of -- 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
That's very nice, Reuel.  But, in fact, we have a government headed by one of Khomeini's 
lieutenants, namely Khamenei, who has a government that -- I think you'd agree with 
me -- is at least as vicious as Khomeini's.   
 
19:38:34 
 
Where is the moderation?  Where have these people improved? 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
No, but they didn't -- they haven't arrived.  They have stopped elections.  The evolution 
would have been in 1997 and 2009.  Each and every time, they've stopped it.  Now, if -- 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
[inaudible] 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel, let him finish.  Daniel, let him finish. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
If, in the future -- we have to get there first.  What you're doing is closing down the 
option.  You're basically saying, "You don't get to have the right to have a democratic 
process."  And by the way, the Western democratic process, if you recall, was not 
terribly pretty.  It was really ugly, took a long time.  They'll have to go a really long 
distance before they actually have as bad a time as we did. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Daniel Pipes. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
I would like to point out that Brian argued that the nonviolent Islamists are the antidote 
to the violent Islamists, that al-Qaida had not much of a role, had no role in Egypt and 
Tunisia.   
 
19:39:35

Well, what about Syria?  I believe al-Qaida has a role there.  And if not al-Qaida itself, al-
Qaida types.  What we see in Syria is the bringing in of violent Islamism, and -- 
 
Brian Katulis: 
Which is the result of a dictatorship.  If I take your formula -- and I respect your formula. 
 I don't agree with it.  But if I take your formula, Zuhdi and Daniel, you got to rely on the 
goodwill of Bashar al-Assad to sit down with secular liberals and give up power and 
actually open up the political system.  That's your formula right now.  You've been 
relying on that for years. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
I'm going to rely on the goodwill -- 
 
Brian Katulis: 
And the al-Qaida elements which I'm worried about in Syria, in the opposition, are the 
product of decades of that dictatorship that you're arguing for tonight. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Zuhdi Jasser. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
I'll tell you the reality -- 
 
[applause] 
 
I'll tell you the reality of this motion.  The reality, Brian, is, in this motion, for example, in 
Syria, you had the SNC, the Syrian National Council that was really a conglomeration of 
expatriate Islamist that got together.   
 
19:40:33 
 
And the question is, this is relevant to America, because do we tip towards those 
Islamists or do we tell the Syrians on the ground, who were a majority non-Islamist a 
year ago, that they will get the backing of America and the West, true defenders of 
freedom that will not push their oppressors, the new oppressors instead of the old 
oppressors.  And that's what Islamists are.  And our opposition, I think, one of the things 
you're forgetting -- I've yet to hear from them one example of Islamists that have 
moderated, whether it's the Taliban or the Wahabis in Saudi Arabia or the Islamists in 
Iran.  Every one of them seems to dig their heels in more and more. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Here is their chance.

[applause] 
 
All right.  Brian Katulis, go ahead, sir, Brian. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
Yeah, I started out my presentation talking about the vast majority of Muslims living in 
South Asia.  Indonesia, the number one largest Muslim country in the world.  Prime 
examples of where Islamists ran as political parties and they failed.   
 
19:41:31 
 
They failed.  And their populations actually voted them out.  You have -- they are 
weakened, because they didn't deliver, and I think the central premise that you guys 
have is that elected Islamists don't change or morph, or somehow don't become like 
other politicians.  Well, guess what -- they do, when you actually have open systems. 
 We see this in Turkey too.  And I think there -- steps forward and steps backward on 
Turkey's democracy, but by and large, Turkey, I think, is a much more sustainable 
proposition than what Daniel was talking about back in the Cold War era, back in the 
20th century.  We're in the 21st century. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, can -- 
 
Brian Katulis: 
We've got to deal with these realities. 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel, Daniel, I -- 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Jumping up and down here. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, go ahead then.  Go ahead.  I have a question, but you go ahead. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Turkey, the first five years under Erdogan and the AKP was very careful because it was 
the military, and they didn't want to make any missteps.  And now that they've gotten 
rid of the military, oh, they're going with guns blazing, and they're investigating, and 
they're enjailing, and they're indicting.   
 
19:42:33

And there are hundreds of people who have nothing to do with any kind of conspiracy 
are put away for life.  You name it.  This is an increasingly authoritarian government.  So 
I stick by our position which is that the Islamists, when they get to power, whether in 
Iran or Turkey or Egypt or Tunisia, just get worse with time.  And you mischaracterized 
our position.  It's not that Assad will be having negotiations with the liberals in Syria.  It's 
that we will be advocating for the liberals.  We will be pushing Assad.  We have 
enormous power, implicit in this motion is U.S. policy.  What do we want the United 
States government to do?  And the worst thing we want the United States government 
to create space for the liberal, free minded modern people to enter in.  And you're 
saying you want the U.S. government to invite the medieval types to come in. 
 
John Donvan: 
But does creating that free space -- does creating that free space continue on some level 
of support for dictatorship, to create space for the liberals? 
 
19:43:34 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
No.  Look, take Mubarak.  He was there for 30 years.  No way do I want to help 
Mubarak.  I want to push Mubarak.  Or take an actual government today.  I want to push 
the Algerians.  I don't want to help the Algerian government.  I want to open up Algeria. 
 I want the liberals, the moderns in Algeria to have more of a voice.  That should be our 
role.  That is the American role through history, is we are the advocates of democracy 
understood as liberal democracy around the world.  Let's do it in the Middle East, not 
just in South America and Africa and South Asia and East Asia.  Let's do it in the Middle 
East too. 
 
John Donvan: 
Reuel Marc Gerecht. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
I think that's all great and fine, and we should support liberal democrats everywhere. 
 I'm -- you know, I've been in favor of covert action programs all over the place. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But I just don't see that you've got the traction.  And I don't see if you go to Mubarak -- 
Mubarak made a real hobby out of squashing liberals like he made a hobby of squashing 
everybody else.   
 
19:44:33 
 
And Mubarak says, no, I don't want to do that.  And what's the United States going to 
do?  All right.  Take the money away.  Take the money from the military, and then he

says, all right, you're going to weaken me.  The Islamists are coming.  You've already said 
the Islamists did come.  So I don't think you can create liberals in the Middle East out of 
sand.  There has to be a process, an evolution.  In the West, liberals were not born 
overnight.  They came into being.  It was -- I don't want to go through Occidental history 
here.  It was a very ugly process.  What he is saying is that, no, you don't get to have 
that process.  We had that process, but no, not you.  Muslims don't get to evolve.  You 
have to be born liberals now. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Zuhdi Jasser. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
Reuel, I'm sorry, you're living in this academic bubble that is so far removed from the 
reality on the ground that, you know, the reality on the ground is, as a Muslim, the 
Islamists never want debate, never allow debate.   
 
19:45:34 
 
They suffocate liberal movements.  And if you even look -- let's take Turkey.  The 
secretary general of the OIC is Turkish.  Give me one statement that man has made 
criticizing any other Islamic regime, Islamists from Iran to the Taliban, et cetera, to the 
Saudis, the Wahabis, not one, because together they seek a neocaliphate.  They seek 
Islamic hegemony around the world.  And the Islamists don't allow debate.  I can tell you 
this from experience, and it's no better than the dictators.  And actually, American 
influence, if we want to help the liberals, and if they see us saying, oh, well, the Islamists 
are a little better, they're going to throw us aside and say, geez, there the Americans go 
again caring not about us. 
 
John Donvan: 
Zuhdi, Daniel, your partner likened Islamists to Nazis.  Do you agree with that?  And I 
want to bring that to the other side, Nazis.  They can't be reformed, and they're all the 
same.  Can you take that on?  Brian Katulis. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
Oh, absolutely not.  I mean, especially elected Islamists.  And again, we're at the early 
stage of an experiment here in many of these countries.   
 
19:46:33 
 
But just look at the facts.  Look at countries that are Muslim majority.  And again, I hate 
to bring up Indonesia again.  But bring that up again, and they change.  They morph, 
they modify.  I see it in Egypt already.  And again, we're in the early stages.  It's hard to 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

game this out.  But you have different strands of Islamism even within the Muslim 
Brotherhood, which we paint Islamists.  And this is sort of like a nice tactic people like to 
do is lump 1.6 billion Muslims all together and talk about sort of political Islam in some 
sort of way and make us believe that these people, the constituents, are fools and that 
they'll just blindly follow some sort of theology here. 
 
John Donvan: 
And you're saying not all Islamists are the same. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
They're not at all, and [unintelligible] modify -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to bring that point to the other side.  Zuhdi Jasser. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
I mean, John, the issue is, Brian, Indonesia was never Islamist to prove your point.  I 
mean, President Wahid has been -- who is now passed away, but wrote a book called 
"The Illusion of the Islamic State," in which he, as a previous president, had the --  
 
19:47:30 
 
-- the bully pulpit of his presidency to fight against this Islamism, the identity principles 
of Islamic state, principles of Sharia, et cetera.  And still to this day, the Islamist 
movement in Indonesia is very potent, but they've never been in control.  If they were in 
control, that might prove your thesis.  But your thesis is that somehow we should allow 
them to tip towards Islamism because that's the pathway to some type of better 
system.  And they are Nazis.  Why?  Because this is a supremacist idea.  Look at the -- 
what this country came out of.  I think you're forgetting American history.  Our history 
was that Christianity reformed and separated church and state, not through really a 
simple process.  It was revolutionary with hundreds of thousands dying in Europe for the 
enlightenment and then the American Revolution.  Do you think that the Islamic world is 
going to separate mosque and state in any less violent type of a revolution?  It's going to 
be major.  And the Islamists aren't going to just sort of hand it over. 
 
John Donvan: 
Reuel. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
I'm not sure I followed that at the end.   
 
19:48:31 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

There are Islamists out there who are hell on earth.  And I can't think of a single good 
Islamist.  It's impossible.  That's really not the point.  The point is how you bring about -- 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
We rest our case. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
-- how do you bring about a political system where you have evolution, where you have 
some chance -- if you are going -- you're not going to get a situation -- and I think we've 
seen that since the Arab -- great Arab revolt started.  You're not going to get a situation 
where liberals are going to win an election.  People of faith are going to win the 
election.  Islamist parties are going to win the elections.  So you're going to have to take 
that as a given.  You're not going to be able to have the United States come in there and 
dictatorially essentially say -- I mean, Kissinger made the great line, "Democracy is great, 
but I really want to know who gets to win."  You don't get to know who gets to win. 
 You've got to go through the process.  You have to set up a system where you have a 
jousting ethic.  Fundamentalists have to fight with fundamentalists.   
 
19:49:33 
 
In Egypt, the Nour party of the Salafis is absolutely morally repugnant, all right?  No 
doubt about it.  But they are actually in the process of collapse right now because they 
haven't figured out how to handle the pressure of democracy yet.  The Muslim 
Brotherhood is having serious internal debates because they haven't figured out how to 
handle -- this is all new terrain for them.  That's what we want.  We want them to fight it 
out.  It's not going to produce something pretty in the short term.  But what they're 
suggesting, having dictatorship and somehow having the United States, oh, I'm going to 
create a liberal here and a liberal there and a liberal here, it makes no sense. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I want to let Daniel Pipes respond but in a -- 
 
[applause] 
 
But I just want to -- before I say that, after Daniel's response, I'd like to go to questions 
from you in the audience.  And the way that will work, if you raise your hand, and you 
catch my attention, and I can pretty much see everybody, I won't be able to take 
questions from upstairs.   
 
19:50:32 
 
So if you want to ask one, you should come down.  There will be people in the micro -- 
in the aisles with microphones.  Stand up, please.  Tell us who you are.  And hold the 
microphone about a fist's distance from your mouth for the sake of the radio broadcast.

 I urge you to ask a question that is actually a question.  I'll have to stop you if you're 
debating with the debaters.  But I'm fine if you state a very, very short premise to your 
question.  But when I say very short, I mean in 17 words or less.  Daniel Pipes. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Thank you, John.  I think what this difference boils down to is that our opponents do not 
apologize for Islamists.  You just heard it.  I can't think of a single good Islamist we just 
heard.  And we sure don't apologize for dictators, Assad, Mubarak and the rest.  So 
nobody likes anybody. 
 
[laughter] 
 
The difference is you just saw Reuel scornfully, "Liberals, we're creating liberals. 
 Liberals, we're creating liberals."   
 
19:51:33 
 
We think that this is the hope of the future.  We think they do exist.  We saw them.  We 
saw them in Tunisia and Egypt and Syria.  We see them throughout the region.  We 
believe they're the hope.  And so we're trying to find a way to build them.  They have 
given up on the liberals and are willing to go with the -- they're not happy about it, I 
gather, but they're quite ready to go with the medieval totalitarian order, medieval style 
totalitarian order.  Well, no thanks.  Let's be hopeful.  Let's try for a better Middle East. 
 Let's work with the people who have a decent vision of the future. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let's go to some questions.

Female Speaker: 
-- of New York City.  I understand the premise of those of you who are speaking for the 
motion.   
 
19:52:33 
 
And it's very enticing to believe that the Islamists will morph.  What I don't understand 
is how will they morph if there's so much violence that once they begin to change they 
are in tremendous danger of being killed by other Islamists?  There's so much murder, 
so much violence as part of that culture, aren't they afraid to morph? 
 
John Donvan: 
Perfect question.  This side. 
 
[applause] 
 
This side.  Brian Katulis or Reuel Marc Gerecht.  Brian Katulis. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
Look, I think they have a greater possibility to morph now than if they were facing 
Saddam Hussein who killed hundreds of thousands of people, more possibility in places 
like Tunisia to morph than they did in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi, when you had 
organized mass murder.   
 
19:53:37 
 
And let's be clear about this.  I want to stress this.  The transition in the Middle East is in 
the very early stages, sorts of violence that we saw and we've been talking about, that 
killed our ambassador in Libya, those extremists that killed him and murdered him, 
those sorts of things -- we need to recognize that those threats have not been 
completely eradicated.  We also need to recognize that the large protests against those 
extremists in Libya would never have actually happened under Muammar Gaddafi.  We 
need to recognize that there's a space there, that I'm not in favor of elected Islamists or 
liberals or anything.  I'm in favor of systemic change that has legitimacy.  And I think this 
is a key distinction between what Reuel and I are saying and what the other team is 
saying.  We can't implant this.   
 
19:54:29 
 
We need to recognize the reality that because of the dysfunction caused by 
dictatorships for decades, you're going to have this first early result.  And, yes, there's 
still going to be violence and risks, but I actually think it's less than what we saw in terms 
of the hundreds of thousands killed by the dictators in these countries.  And I actually 
think the more that you have popular reaction of the sort that we saw in the streets of 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -

Benghazi against those murderers, you have I think a possibility then to push them and 
further marginalize them in that debate. 
 
John Donvan: 
Other side, do you want to respond? 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
Yes. 
[applause] 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
I think -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Zuhdi Jasser. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
I think, again, one of the core things that they're missing, and if you are for this motion 
you're missing the fact that Islamism cannot be morphed.  We have a Muslim Liberty 
Project where we have youth that work with us from the young ages of 15 to 30, and we 
realized that we had to do it at a young age because once an Islamist looks at the world 
through an Islamic lens, that governments and everything should be looked at through 
Islam and through cleric and through Imams, not through reason, not through 
independence, not through the separation of mosque and state, and that their identity 
doesn't come from a national liberal identity but through a faith based Islamic state, 
they are done.   
 
19:55:44 
 
You can't reform them away from that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Zuhdi, when -- 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
And that's what we've got. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- when millions of people vote for an Islamist party, what are they voting for? 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
They're voting for a whim, they're voting for this sense that morality will come when 
corruption was before them.  Why did the -- some of the Palestinian populations vote 
for the terrorist, Hamas, when they had Fatah?  They saw Fatah as corrupt.  So this 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

binary equation has created two evils that fed off of one another, and elections are not 
democracy.  Democracy is about principles of freedom and liberty, of representing the 
minority, and -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Would you want to discourage an election if you felt that Islamists were going to prevail 
in that election? 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
No, no, I mean, and we fought communism without preventing the communist party 
from existing, et cetera, so I wouldn't want to outlaw.  I think you can -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no, no, no.  My question isn't really that.  My question is are the paradox of these -- 
of encouraging a democratic election and then the election produces results that are 
anathema to you, do you go back a stage and wish that you hadn't had the democratic 
election? 
 
19:56:39 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
No.  I think it should at least -- they shouldn't become our allies -- we should at least 
make a stance that just because they were elected doesn't mean that we have to share 
their vision or treat them any differently than we would a dictator. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Another question. 
 
[applause] 
 
Right down front.  Just wait for the mic, sir.  It's on its way. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Okay. 
 
John Donvan: 
And just -- I just want to give the camera a second to catch up with you.  Okay, go 
ahead. 
 
Male Speaker: 
The name is Russ, hi.  Mr. Pipes, you had said that part of the whole process and as, 
basically, U.S. involvement, that democracy is part of our job to spread.  It's what we do. 
 I'm kind of wondering why a 236-year-old system should be superimposed over 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

thousands of years of a system that's already existed there and why it's our job to do 
that.  
19:57:33 
 
It seems to me that we have always been able to effect change through the back door 
and not through the front door.  By giving them popular culture, by giving them the 
things that we embrace as a country and that we love, you work through the youth of 
the countries that we're talking about -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you wrap to a question on this?  I think you do have a good one here. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Well, I guess the question really is, is the answer not necessarily to, you know, try to go 
through the front door and work on changing the leadership in those countries and 
getting them to change their minds, but rather in the up-and-coming youth of those 
countries by giving them all the things that have changed other countries, like Russia 
and Japan and -- you know, popular culture. 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel Pipes. 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Thank you, Ross.  I don't think American popular culture these days is particularly 
politically liberal or democratic. 
 
19:58:31 
 
[laughter] 
 
But I accept the basis of your point, which is that the United States is -- has unique 
instruments of influence, including its popular culture, beginning in the 1920s, which 
nobody else ever had before, and we have the most of, including its financial clout, 
including its military, its extraordinary range of tools.  So here we are, as Americans, 
saying, "Well, how should we use these tools?"  And our side is saying, let's use them 
with the goal of bringing to office people who think as we do, who believe in democracy, 
et cetera, liberal democracy.  And this has been our career.  Woodrow Wilson came up 
with the 14 points 100 years ago.   
 
19:59:30 
 
And we had in Japan and Germany and Austria and Italy and other countries, we 
forcefully imposed it, and look, it worked.  It can be imposed.  In Tiananmen Square in 
1989, they had a version of our Statue of Liberty as the representation of what they 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016

sought in freedom.  We are -- the United States is the symbol of freedom, of liberty, of 
democracy.  We are that.  And it is something particularly noble about this country. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me take this to the other side.  [inaudible] 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
I'm enjoying Daniel being the neocon.  I'm enjoying this enormously.  You know, the -- 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
That's very snide. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
No, I agree with him. 
 
[laughter] 
 
For me, that's a compliment.  You know, I have to say this.  It's not a question of 
imposition.  I mean, what we're talking about here is, in fact, people in the Middle East 
have absorbed, profoundly, western ideas.   
 
20:00:32 
 
They haven't, by any means, absorbed them perfectly, ideally, to the level that we 
would like.  But one of the things I'm arguing is, in fact, the idea of popular sovereignty 
has been absorbed through a wide body politic, including the faithful, including within 
those that we call Islamic fundamentalists.  If you can -- when I was in Najaf in Iraq and I 
was having discussions with one of the elder sons of Grand Ayatollah Hakim, and we 
were discussing what democracy was, I mean, he understood to be, in his own 
conception, ma'ruf, that it something that was sacred, that popular sovereignty was 
sacred.  Now, in the next breath, he said, "I don't know where the red lines are."  He had 
no idea where they are.  We have red lines, too, in democracy, whether they be about 
abortion or other issues.  We're not quite sure where certain issues in our ethics collide, 
where we don't want to compromise.  They have, for the very first time, this problem.   
 
20:01:29 
 
It is great that an elder son of one of the senior clerics in Iraq has this problem.  That's 
where you want to take this.  And it's not a question of imposition.  It's a question of 
they, themselves, taking the imports that they have voluntarily taken in and trying to 
figure out how they work out a more humane society.  In their case, it's easy, given 
where they came from with Saddam Hussein, because they could screw up for a long 
time and it would still be more humane than what they had before.

John Donvan: 
All right.  I want to remind you that we are in the question-and-answer section of this 
Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan, your moderator.  We have four 
debaters, two teams of two arguing this motion:  "Better Elected Islamists Than 
Dictators."  Right down in front, ma'am. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Thank you.  Dr. Ahmed, the author of "In the Land of Invisible Woman."  I've lived in 
Sharia law in Saudi Arabia, and I'm of Pakistani heritage.   
 
20:02:30 
 
So to my colleagues, I'd like you to say, "Better elected Islamists," comment on 
Pakistan's 65-year history where it's advocated to be the world's first Muslim democracy 
where there is no functioning democracy unless you are an Islamist sympathizer.  Please 
comment on that.  But -- and let me also add -- 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait, wait, I'm -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
Let me add, as a Muslim woman and someone who's lived and has friends and relatives 
in the Middle East, I'm offended that you think there are no innate liberals. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Brian Katulis. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
Actually, I didn't say that there are no innate liberals.  And I lived and worked for five 
years in the Middle East.  I go to Pakistan frequently.  I talk to them all of the time. 
 They're fighting that struggle.  And I'll tell you right now, Pakistan's at an interesting 
moment that everybody's negative about Pakistan and what's going on.  There's an 
interesting dynamic that's been underplay there.  And you've seen this.  And I was there 
in 2009 when there was Sufi Mohammed, the head of Pakistani Taliban group, extremist 
group.   
 
20:03:33 
 
He said that courts are un-Islamic.  He said that elections are un-Islamic.  And this was at 
a time, a territory called Swat, about an hour outside of Islamabad, was taken over by 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

those very same extremists.  And I was on the ground there.  And the national outcry 
against Sufi Muhammad and the national protests against a video of a woman being 
beaten in that very same territory, the liberal and democratic response was there.  And 
you saw it in the previous elections in 2008, the MMA.  You know it very well, an 
Islamist party that said that they were going to ban cable television in northwest 
frontier Pakistan.  You know what?  You know what a lot of men love watching WWE 
wrestling in Pakistan.  These parties tried to rule theocratically and by a basis of religious 
ideology, and they failed.   
 
20:04:34 
 
They were voted out in the ballot in 2008.  And as you know, not end of story, not end 
of story at all, because Pakistan is at a dangerous place.  But yes, there are liberals 
there.  And they are fighting against those radical Islamists.  They are going to have an 
election.  Guess what?  Next year.  And they are having an open debate.  That did not 
exist under Zia.  That did not exist under the dictators that ruled, the military dictators 
that quite frankly were backed by the United States, like these gentlemen want us to do. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's hear from these gentlemen. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
And that did not exist at all. 
 
John Donvan: 
Daniel Pipes. 
 
[applause] 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
We don't want to back the dictators.  Can I make it any clearer?  We are not arguing for 
dictators.  We are not arguing to extend their rule.  We are arguing that we can 
influence them in a positive direction.  I would love to see the dictators gone.  I have an 
idea on who can replace the dictators. 
 
20:05:35 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Again, right up against the rear wall there.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  I was 
going to say the guy wearing the black shirt, but that would be like --

Male Speaker: 
I'm [unintelligible] black shirt, I'm just wearing one.  My name is Ben.  I'm an Englishman 
in New York, like the song.  I have a -- my heart is with Brian and Reuel, but my head at 
the moment is with Daniel and Zuhdi.  Reuel you made a passing reference to France. 
 And that got me thinking, the French -- the French spring of 1789 was followed by 200 
years of war, revolution and genocide. 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm getting worried on this question. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yes.  And I'm coming to the question. 
 
Male Speaker: 
I'm getting excited, actually. 
 
Male Speaker: 
I hope so. 
 
John Donvan: 
There are decades to go. 
 
Male Speaker: 
So I'm not going to go through the full 200 years.  I've just -- how are you -- are you -- 
are you convinced that we can somehow avoid a repetition of that pattern in the Middle 
East?   
 
20:06:40 
 
Because you planted those doubts in my mind by saying that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Reuel Marc Gerecht. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
I think the best answer to that is, and the simplest one is, revolutions are bad.  You don't 
want to have a revolution.  You don't want to have the violence that comes with a 
revolution.  What you want to have is the transition that goes through elections.  You 
want to avoid, at all cost, the triumph of the military men, the militarists, the -- I would 
say in the Middle East, the real danger in the Middle East still in most places is not the 
Islamists.  It's actually still the military.  In that you want to have folks become 
responsible for their faiths as quickly as possible.   
 
20:07:28 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
There's only one way you do that.  There's only one way people become responsible, 
and that is through elections.  It is process of elections.  I mean, take Iran.  Iran has just -
- they've had controlled elections.  But the simple fact of having controlled elections in 
Iran has inspired people to actually take them seriously.  There was a promise in the 
Islamic -- when the Shah fell, there was the Islamist strain under Khomeini, and there 
was also the democratic strain.  They are in constant tension.  And I would argue that 
actually the democrats have done far better in at least taking the intellectual train. 
 
John Donvan: 
But this does not make you an Iran fan. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
No, I'm -- 
 
John Donvan: 
To the Daniel's point is that nobody likes anybody. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
No, I'm not a fan of Iran.  All I'm telling you is that it the Iran case is very interesting is 
because it shows evolution.  It shows, as we saw in the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe, you can have lots of fallen communists.  The notion that Daniel is suggesting 
that in fact Islamists stay as they are is false.  It's all depending upon the political 
circumstances.   
 
20:08:32 
 
No one stays as is. 
 
John Donvan: 
Zuhdi Jasser. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
I think the central fulcrum of their argument is somehow that the voting booth, that the 
election process, that once these citizens enter a voting booth, they somehow become 
liberals or democrats when, in fact, it's a mobocracy  that they're advocating for, that 
somehow 50 percent -- we learned in this country we had to have a civil war and a civil 
rights movement until we understood what liberal principles were from our own 
Constitution.  So somehow they're telling us that elections are going to evolve this 
without a revolution.  And the Islamists will actually entrench it more.  And I think again, 
you are insulting Muslims to assume that the collectivist concept of Islamism, that 
somehow all Muslims must think alike, have the same political party, have the same 
aspiration for the state, that there's no left to right, that we are all part of this 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

brotherhood party, which is Islamism, is somehow freedom for Muslims or otherwise 
we insult Islam.  
20:09:29 
 
There are a majority of Muslims that don't Islamists, don't want it on our back and reject 
the entire notion. 
 
Brian Katulis: 
I agree with that, and I don't know where that -- I agree with that, and I don't know 
where that straw man is sitting.  The chair's not here.  I mean, that -- I agree with that 
notion. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
[unintelligible] is the straw man. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I haven't gone to the back yet.  The woman in the red dress.  Would you mind -
- can you see that -- I know it's dark back there.  Would you like her to step into the light 
a little bit? 
 
Male Speaker: 
I just like the idea of the woman in red. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah.  Or walk toward the light, ma'am. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Thank you. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Couple years ago there was a debate on IQ Squared about how radical Islam taken over 
Muslims, the Muslim religion.  And the debate people here voted that it had which I 
thought was interesting.  Not knowing a lot about it, it seems as though at the fulcrum 
of the issue, question for you is, will elected Islamists actually allow any evolution into 
democracy happen, or will they suppress it?   
 
20:10:36 
 
That seems to -- because I think we all like the idea.  It's just, will it practically happen? 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  That's a question for this side for the motion.  Reuel Marc Gerecht. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
We don't know until it happens.  I mean, you can't know this in advance.  There is no 
way right now that we can be certain that you're going to have many elections in Egypt 
and Tunisia and where else democracy spreads to.  That is going to be, you know, trial 
by error or by experiment so -- but unless you get there, you'll never know.  So you have 
to go down that path before we can even answer that question.  Now, I can give you a 
religious discussion of this, how I think on the Shiite side and the Sunni side, how 
Western ideas about democracy have penetrated that can give you some hope there. 
 But I -- we just don't know until it happens. 
 
20:11:30 
 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Reuel doesn't know.  Reuel doesn't know, but I do. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Oh, Daniel, you could have just left it there.  It was perfect. 
 
[laughter] 
 
I was trying to help you out by going to another question.  But go ahead.  All right.  I'll go 
to another question unless you really -- all right.  It landed so well.  Sir, yeah, thanks.  A 
mic will come to you, halfway up the aisle. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Hi, my name is Patrick McGinnis.  I just wanted to return to Mr. Pipes comment, 
suggestion about America's place in this process.  I think, you know, I would be very 
happy if America could through its intervention bring about liberal democracy in the 
Middle East, and maybe in a time of American hegemony that would've been possible, 
but our nation building efforts in the Middle East over the past 10 years have been very 
difficult.  So based on the experience we've had, I guess I'd like to return to what you 
said and put it in a practical context. 
 
20:12:31 
 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Yes, the effort's in Iraq and Afghanistan have been, will have been, I believe, failures, 
you can come back in five, 10 years to Iraq and Afghanistan, you'll see the barest traces 
of the vast American engagement there.  It will have been a failure, so, yes, I agree with 
the premise of your question, but I'm not calling for invasion and putting in rulers and so

forth.  I'm accepting the fact that there are autocrats.  And I'm saying, "Okay, let's use 
our influence in a constructive way to make it easier for our kind of people who are 
there to gain in strength to be important and eventually to lead the Middle East out of 
the mire in which it is today," but I'm not calling for invasions. 
 
John Donvan: 
Right, so -- 
 
[applause]   
 
Brian Katulis: 
And I'm all in favor of that because I spent five years of my life in the Middle East 
working with liberals, with people pushing for human rights, working for women's rights 
in the West Bank, in Gaza, in Egypt, across the region.   
 
20:13:33 
 
And I'm in favor of it, and I think it's a nice idea.  And I was against the war in Iraq, but 
the reality is -- and this is what we're debating tonight is that good intentioned 
Americans who want to go in peacefully and try to orchestrate the politics of these 
places won't produce the sorts of results that you expect.  What you need is the rough 
and tumble, the jousting that Reuel talks about.  We can help.  We were trying to help 
with the tools of, "How do you organize?" and I think this is a fundamental struggle in 
the next wave of Egypt because there will be a next wave.  The Islamists swept in this 
first round of elections.  There's still a lot of uncertainty about the constitution, but 
there'll be another round of elections.  And I do believe that American, European, and 
other organizations have a role to actually support these groups to become better 
organized.  That's not what we're arguing.  We're not arguing for elected Islamists. 
 We're opening -- we're arguing for open politics in these places, and it doesn't come by 
invading these countries, and it doesn't come by simply trying to negotiate with some of 
these dictators and say, "Please open up."   
 
20:14:36 
 
It comes through an organic process, a political process, that what Reuel and I are saying 
that in the first waves are likely going to lead to elected Islamists -- but that's not going 
to close off the debate.  It's going to open it up and lead to multiple centers of power in 
these countries.  
 
John Donvan: 
Another question?  Sir, down in front.

Male Speaker: 
Like to -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I -- we just need to get the mic to you, thanks. 
 
Male Speaker: 
I'd like to bring you back to the agreement -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you just -- would you mind identifying yourself?  Thanks. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Okay, Constantine Canacledes [spelled phonetically].  I'm with Scholars for Peace in the 
Middle East. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Both sides indicated that they agreed that both choices of elected Islamists, dictators, 
were heinous, they were totalitarian, et cetera.   
 
20:15:25 
 
There was a distinction made early on, and that wasn't addressed, that the same 
repressive regimes can operate, but one tends to operate local and local- regional, and 
as the against side indicated that there is a vast globality of vision and intent on the part 
of Islamists, that they have a vision that goes far beyond the periphery and the 
boundaries of the state -- nation and state.  And that wasn't addressed, and so I'd like 
this side, pro side, to address, "Isn't that a valid distinction that, that would suggest a far 
greater potential for ill on a global level from Islamic fundamentalists and elected 
Islamists and -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Can I restate the question and -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- make sure that I'm understanding what you're asking?  You're saying -- you're asking 
about the point that dictators are working from one state.  Islamists are a part of a 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

global worldwide aspiration to control many, many states -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
A mission, yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- and you want the side arguing for the motion to address that? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Sure. 
 
20:16:32 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
I think it's highly likely that if you have more than one election, that what you're going 
to see -- and you always see it with democratic politics, is that your aspirations become 
much more localized.  And I don't think that you're going to see any Caliphate.  I think 
the notion of that is a bit farfetched.  I think it runs against the most successful Western 
export to the Middle East which is nationalism which has profoundly affected even 
Islamist movements throughout the area.  So I don't think that's a big problem.  Now, 
you could find common purpose.  It's entirely possible that you will have Islamists in one 
country look fondly and affectionately at Islamists in another country and seek to 
support them.  That's -- 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
What's the OIC?  What's the OIC, then?  What is that? 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
It's a mess.  I mean, the -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait, wait, wait.  Term of art.  Explain the OIC. 
 
20:17:35 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation is 56 countries that share nothing other than 
the fact that they have majority Muslim countries and also the fact that they rejected 
the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, and many of them say they signed in, which they 
did, but then they signed the Cairo Declaration that talks about blasphemy laws, 
apostasy, et cetera.  So it's based out of Saudi Arabia, and they don't seem to be critical 
of one another. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
Well, that's because the primary -- the OIC is really about them saying, in a rather 
childish way, you know, "Here we are; here we are.  Notice us.  We're not the West, et 
cetera, et cetera."  The OIC is -- has been, in the past, sort of a concoction of 
dictatorships that, virtually, the only thing they could agree on is how much they dislike 
the United States, how much they dislike the Israel, and other, you know, less concealed 
forms of anti-Semitism.   
 
20:18:31 
 
It's -- I don't really see that the OIC actually has anything to do with the democratic 
process.  It has a lot to do -- it's sort of like an Islamic version of the United Nations, 
which I don't recommend.  I don't think it's a moral paragon.  Most of the time, it's not 
very serious. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me -- we have to wrap -- we have to wrap up this section.  And I just want to bring 
up a topic that I thought would come from the audience, and it didn't, and we don't 
have much time, so I want to ask it very quickly to this side.  We haven't heard very 
much about the issue of women's rights.  You all acknowledge that, at this point, most 
Islamist movements are not friendly to women's rights in the way that we would 
understand it.  And I want to ask this side, you know, where do you draw the line on 
that?  Where do you say, you know, it can be open and it can be evolving, but in the 
meantime, in the short term, this abuse of women's rights just cannot be tolerated? 
 
Brian Katulis: 
It's a red line, and I think we see the dictatorship of Saudi Arabia as one of the worst 
offenders of women's rights.  And I think you see the places that have -- again, Muslim 
majority countries, Malaysia, Indonesia, and other places with Islamist parties -- respect 
for women's rights, like everything else.   
 
20:19:39 
 
In places like Morocco too, where you have space for a discourse and a debate about 
this.  And in Morocco, they had Mudawwana, a code to improve the status of women's 
rights.  So a big debate is happening here.  And I don't believe, for a moment, that the 
rights of women under Saddam Hussein were a lot better than what we have today 
inside of Iraq.  I don't believe that at all.  And I think there's a fight that women, as long 
as they can go back to the ballot box, as long as there are institutions there, as long as 
there's accountability in the system, as long as women have a voice in those debates, I 
believe that you'll see, eventually, a more sustainable and legitimate foundation for 
women's rights in these countries.

20:20:29 
 
John Donvan: 
Fifteen seconds. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
I have to say, when the dictator, when Mubarak wants to control the women in his 
population, he uses the Islamists.  When the Saudis want to control the women in their 
population, the Islamist Wahabis are the ones that they use to do that.  So now all 
you're doing is you're elevating the judges and the teachers from their positions to run 
the whole country.  I'm sorry; I'm not going to -- you know, I think we need to vote 
against the motion, as a result. 
 
John Donvan: 
And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our 
motion is, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  And remember, this is -- we're now 
going to go to closing statements, and this is their last chance to persuade you of the 
power and the quality of their arguments.  But before that, I want to remind you that 
you voted beforehand.  Immediately after the closing statements, you will be asked to 
vote again, and the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our 
winner.  But first, on to round three, closing statements.  They will be two minutes each. 
 And speaking first, against our motion, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators," Daniel 
Pipes, president of the Middle East Forum. 
 
20:21:35 
 
Daniel Pipes: 
Thank you.  The word checkmate in chess comes from Persian, "shah mat," which 
roughly translates to the shah, meaning the king, is defeated.  Now, there was a Shah 
who was actually defeated in 1979.  He was thrown out by Khomeini and the Islamists. 
 And what's so striking, in retrospect, is how many westerners greeted this event with 
rapturous excitement.  For example, the deeply influential French philosopher Michel 
Foucault called Ayatollah Khomeini a saint.  In this country, Jimmy Carter's ambassador 
to the United Nations, Andrew Young, made a little less of a statement, called him 
"some kind of saint."  Well, look how things turned out.  Iran is today the rogue state 
along with North Korea, par excellence.  It's government is despised by three quarters or 
more of the population.   
 
20:22:36 
 
It is the leading terrorist state in the world, terrorist sponsoring state in the world.  Its 
nuclear plans make it the single greatest menace to world peace today.  So looking back 
to 1979 and calling Khomeini a saint, expecting things to be better, I would suggest to 
you not to make them -- the same mistake, not to put your faith in Islamists.  Expect the

worst of the Islamist regimes.  These are people who are not going to let go of power. 
 One man, one vote, one time or maybe two times is what you can expect.  And 
therefore I say, better the greedy dictators that we can push around that we can change 
than the Islamist dictators who are our deepest enemies who we cannot change, who 
will be there for decades to come, who will inflict enormous damage on their own 
populations, be aggressors toward their neighbors and deeply mired in anti-
Americanism.  Thank you.

[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Daniel Pipes.  Our motion is "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  And 
here to speak in his position, closing statement on the motion, Reuel Marc Gerecht, a 
senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 
 
Reuel Marc Gerecht: 
You know, I think Daniel started off by talking about tactics.  And I have to say this is the 
part I simply don't understand.  I mean, he says we have dictators to push around and 
make evolve.  But we've -- they didn't evolve, and we did push them around.  I don't 
understand how you actually make a dictator become -- allow liberals to win in a 
democracy and deprive everybody else.  I mean, would that were possible.  But it's not 
possible.  Doesn't actually make any sense.  If liberals are going to triumph, they're 
going to have to triumph in a free election sometime.   
 
20:24:29 
 
You're not going to be able to hold off an election and know -- you only get to have that 
election when you know that they are going to win.  And until that moment, you can't 
have the election.  Now, I think that's a recipe that any dictator can look at and say, I 
think I'm a dictator for life.  And I think I have to be honest here.  I think that's what 
Daniel is saying too.  I think what he is really saying is it's just too big a risk, so we're just 
going to have to keep the dictators more or less forever because unless you actually are 
tested at the urns, you're never going to know how popular you are.  And I would 
suggest to you it's only by being tested at the urns that you're actually going to begin to 
develop a liberal framework, a liberal process that makes sense.  It's only by defining 
yourself against those who are not liberal that you're going to be able to gain votes.   
 
20:25:28 
 
I don't see how in the Middle East, where the region has been defined by faith, 
increasingly so under dictatorship, that you get to imagine a scenario whereby suddenly, 
through American pressure, intelligently applied, of course, because Americans always

apply pressure intelligently, that you are going to create a liberal order without coming 
to the ballot box and testing yourself.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Reuel Marc Gerecht.  Our motion is "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators." 
 And here to summarize his position against this motion, Zuhdi Jasser who is president 
of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy. 
 
Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser: 
Even before we said a word, our opposition was trying to paste us with the dictators. 
 And at the end, I think if you look at the poster children for Islamists, which is really the 
question in this motion, the poster children for the Islamism movement are the Muslim 
Brotherhood.  And look no further than their emblem.   
 
20:26:28 
 
Not their emblem in English that says, "Freedom and justice" and all those good words 
that we want to hear, but the words in Arabic and under it in Arabic, it says, [speaking 
Arabic] and that's the beginning of a passage in our Koran that refers I think to 
something else, but it refers to, if you look at the translation, "Hence make ready 
against them whatever force and whatever mounts you are able to muster so that you 
might deter thereby the enemies of God who are your enemies as well."  That is on the 
emblem of the brotherhood in Arabic.  Their motto, "Allah is our objective, the prophet 
is our leader.  The Koran is our constitution, jihad is our way, dying in the way of Allah is 
our highest hope."  They got elected, and they haven't seemed to have abandoned that 
motto.  Yet our opposition wants you to vote for a whim that somehow these 
demagogues, these Islamist supremacists will abandon these ideas.  And I haven't seen 
one piece of evidence that they have.  In fact, when they.  In fact, when they get in 
power, they smother the liberals.  And I think if you believe that hope springs eternal, 
then you should vote for the side for the motion.   
 
20:27:27 
 
If you believe that pessimism, that believing that Islamists are not better, but that that 
pessimism will signal to the liberals on the ground that we are with them, that we will 
not support their new dictators, then ultimately you must vote against the resolution 
and against the motion.  
 
So many of our families have had it with dictators.  Don't push upon our communities 
new dictators using religious language and suits.  True moderation demands the 
abandonment of Islamism.  You can't band-aid Islamism.  It's a supremacist ideology. 
 And it's bigoted to assume that Muslims and Islam can't have a third path, that Islamism

  Arlington, VA 22203 

is Islam.  And it's not.  So you must vote against the motion if you believe in real hope, 
real hope for those on the ground, and that those dying in the revolutions did not die in 
order to give opportunity to new Islamist dictators; they died for real liberty. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Zuhdi Jasser.  Our motion is, "Better Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  And 
here to summarize his position in support of the motion, Brian Katulis, who is a senior 
fellow at the Center for American Progress. 
 
20:28:31 
 
Brian Katulis: 
This debate tonight has made me think a lot about the previous century and our 
century, the 21st century.  And I think we see a worldview on contrast here.  And when I 
hear our opponents tonight speak, I think about the 1950s in this country when we talk 
about -isms and Communism and lump large categories of people under one big banner 
and say that this is an ideological crusade; we can't deal with them; we can't talk with 
them; they're all lumped together, and no matter what, you can't do anything about 
that.  And I started out by saying that you -- we really have a choice here tonight.  It's 
either to accept the reality, a reality that the dictatorships in the Middle East and in 
parts of South Asia have fostered the sorts of ideologies that led to the deaths of people 
in those societies and right here in Manhattan on 9/11.   
 
20:29:33 
 
And we've got a choice here today.  We can stick with that old system that is crumbling, 
a system in countries that have a population where more than half of the population is 
under the age of 25.  And change is coming, whether we like it or not.  And we can 
pretend like the system of dictatorships that we see in Saudi Arabia or in Iran or in other 
places, that we can work with them somehow and they'll open up, and that we'll 
actually whisper in the ear of liberals, and they'll bring about change in those societies. 
 We can continue to pretend that that's the pathway forward.  I believe that the rough-
and-tumble jousting of politics in these societies are the only thing that's going to 
produce the sort of legitimate change that comes from within.  It's going to take a long 
time.  It won't be simple or easy.  But I actually think we stick with the process of 
democratization as it's unfolding, or we continue on the current path that produces the 
sorts of extremists that we've seen.  Thank you. 
 
20:30:35 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Brian Katulis.  And that concludes our closing statements, and now it's time 
to learn which side you feel has presented the more powerful and highest quality 
argument.  We are asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

your vote, and we'll have the readout almost immediately.  The motion is, "Better 
Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  We're asking you to vote a second time, and this time 
to vote on the quality of the arguments you heard.  If you feel that the team arguing for 
the motion presented the better argument, push number one.  If you feel the team 
arguing against presented the stronger argument, push number two.  And if you 
remained or became undecided, push number three.  And you can ignore the other 
keys, and just correct your last vote, and we will have the results in about 90 seconds. 
 
I just want to say, about the quality of this debate we presented tonight, we've done -- 
I've done 46 of these now, and the question I'm most often asked is, "Which was the 
best debate that you've ever seen put on?"   
 
20:31:36 
 
I think this one is a contender.  I really want to congratulate these guys for doing this. 
 
[applause] 
 
Really, you kept it intelligent, and you kept it honest, and you actually heard and 
engaged with each other on the points that were asked, and you answered the 
questions.  And speaking of questions, there was not a clunker from the audience 
tonight.  It was terrific.  I just want to give a round of applause to everybody who got up 
and asked a question. 
 
[applause] 
 
I have, as ever, a few announcements.  Those of you who have been at the debate.  We 
would be delighted if you would tweet about us.  You would use the Twitter handle 
@IQ2US, and the hash tag is #IQ2US.  Our next debate, if you happen to be in Chicago 
next week on October 10, we will be taking part for the second time in the annual 
Chicago Ideas Week.   
 
20:32:36 
 
And our motion that we will be debating there is "Ration End Of Life Care."  Back here in 
New York, we have another debate coming up in October on the 24th.  The motion is -- 
and we set up some of these topics to -- we feel -- we hope to crisscross with the 
political campaign and with the debates that the candidates were having.  Our motion is 
"The Rich Are Taxed Enough."  Arguing for that motion, we'll have Glenn Hubbard.  He is 
dean of the Columbia Business School and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors 
under George W. Bush and an economic advisor now to presidential candidate Mitt 
Romney.  Art Laffer will be his partner.  He is known as the father of supply side 
economics.  He was a member of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board, 
and he is a former chief economist in the Office of Management and Budget.  Arguing

against that side, Robert Reich, who is former secretary of labor in the Clinton 
administration and professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.   
 
20:33:33 
 
And his partner, arguing against the motion that "The Rich Are Taxed Enough," is Mark 
Zandi, who is one of the most widely followed economic forecasters, and the chief 
economist of Moody's Analytics.  Tickets for this debate, that debate, the New York 
debate, and all of our remaining four debates -- fall debates can be purchased through 
our website, which is www.IQ2US.org.  Also if you can't be physically in the audience, 
right now it's great.  We have a lot of ways for you to catch these debates.  As I 
mentioned at the beginning, we're being live streamed even as we speak now, on the 
Wall Street Journal's video initiative, WSJ Live.  And you can hear these debates and this 
one also at the NPR, WNYC, that would be here in New York, and you can watch it on 
WNET and on the World Digital Channel.  Okay, it's all in.  Our motion has been "Better 
Elected Islamists Than Dictators."  We have heard the arguments for and against this 
motion.  You voted twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards.   
 
20:34:32 
 
And the team whose numbers have changed the most by your vote will be declared our 
winner, and here's how it goes.  Before the debate, 38 percent were for the motion, 31 
percent were against, 31 percent were undecided.  After the debate, 44 percent are for 
the motion, that's up six percent, 47 percent are against, that is up 16 percent. 
 
[applause] 
 
That means the team arguing against the motion has carried the day.  Our 
congratulations to them, thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared 
U.S.  We'll see you next time.
