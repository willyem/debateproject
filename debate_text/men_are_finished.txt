John Donvan: 
And to launch, with opening remarks that help frame the issue for us, I'd like to 
introduce the chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S., Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Welcome.  Well, "Men are finished," mmm.  I for one hope not.  But there does seem to 
be a lot of evidence that we are.  Traditional male attributes like competitiveness, 
aggression and risk taking are discouraged in -- in classrooms and derided in popular 
culture.  As a society, our values seem to be shifting toward the traditional feminine 
virtues of empathy, cooperation, emotional intelligence.  Increasingly, men are not 
taking the responsibility for parenting, and women are proceeding on their own.   
 
18:48:16 
 
At the top of the cognitive pyramid, women are now a majority in our universities, 
graduate schools of law, business and medicine.  And at the bottom, the high-paid jobs 
men used to hold in construction have vanished with the financial crisis and those in

factories have fallen victim to globalization.  Men are overrepresented in prisons and in 
the ranks of the unemployed.  And underrepresented in higher education.  Project these 
trends forward for a couple of decade, and the future looks pretty bleak for men. 
 
On the other hand, and there always is another hand in our debates, men still hold 
positions of overwhelming dominance as CEOs of our largest companies and financial 
institutions, as creators of large-scale entrepreneurial successes, the Microsofts, 
Oracles, Googles, Facebooks, as top elected officials in both the federal and state 
governments, as the most influential artists and writers, as scientists with 
breakthroughs worthy of Nobel prizes and on and on. 
 
18:49:29 
 
So where do you come out tonight on this question, are men finished?  The answer may 
depend on how you interpret the question.  What we meant but couldn't say in three 
provocative words, is whether we're at a tipping point where women are likely to 
achieve in the future the same sort of dominance that men have had in the past, or 
whether the changes in the relative position of men and women are significant, 
perhaps, but hardly fundamental.  Well, we have an extraordinary group of panelists to 
help you make that decision, and it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them, 
and to our moderator, John Donvan.   
 
18:50:17  
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And I'm going to introduce our debaters in turn.  And when I say their names, I'd 
appreciate it if you could applaud for their names.  But first I'd like to ask for one more 
round of applause for Mr. Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible. 
 
[applause] 
 
True or false, men are finished?  That's what we are here to debate, another verbal 
matchup from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan of ABC News.  We are at the 
Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.  Men are finished.  Two 
teams will be arguing that proposition from opposite sides, one for it and one against it.  
These teams include Dan Abrams, my colleague at ABC News, where he is chief legal 
analyst and author of "Man Down," which gives proof that women are unequivocally 
better than men.

Her partner, David Zinczenko, executive vice president and editor in chief of Men's

Now, this is the debate.  It is a contest.  One team will win, and one team will lose in this 
joust of ideas.  And you, our live audience here at the Skirball Center will be functioning 
as our judges. By the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote 
twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards to register where you stand on 
this motion, "Men are finished."  And the team that has changed the most of your minds 
in the course of the debate will be declared our winner.  So let's go to your preliminary 
vote.   
 
18:52:16 
 
If you go to these key pads at your seat, they have numbers one through three along the 
top row.  If you agree with the motion, "Men are finished," push number one.  If you 
disagree, push number two.  And if you are undecided, push number three.  And if you 
feel that you've made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote.  
And what we're going to do is tabulate those.  And at the end of the debate after the 
second vote, I'll present both numbers.  And reminding you again the team that has 
changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner.  So our 
motion is, "Men are finished."  And now onto round one, opening statements by each 
debater in turn.  They will be seven minutes each.   
 
18:53:16 
 
And I'd like to introduce first for the motion, Hanna Rosin.  She is an award-winning 
journalist for Slate and the Atlantic.

Her 2010 cover story, which was titled, "The End of Men," provoked a fire storm of 
responses. She is now writing a book expanding on her theory that men are losing their 
dominance.  And as a matter of fact, she went to high school, Stuyvesant, a few blocks 
away from here where I understand you were a debater? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
I was a debater, and I'm hoping I can channel that inner nerd tonight and bring it right 
back again. 
 
John Donvan: 
Did -- did you beat the boys a lot? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
We beat everybody.  But my partner was a boy, so I don't know if that counts. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Hanna Rosin. 
 
[applause] 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
I'd like to welcome you all to this debate tonight.  I'd even like to welcome the men to 
the debate tonight although of course I pity you. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Just kidding.  Before I dive in, I just want to say -- I just want to start with a definition.  
What do we mean by men are finished?   
 
18:54:16 
 
We'd like you to think of this as the writing on the wall, as the sign that points to an 
inevitable future.  What I mean by that is that in order to win this debate, we don't have 
to prove that there are no male geniuses, that there's no more male CEOs, that Bill 
Gates and Steve Jobs are figments of your imagination or that all the men are any 
minute going to be rounded up and locked up as -- only to be released every once in a 
while as sex slaves.  That would be -- that would be a preposterous standard.  Maybe it 
sounds good to you guys.   
 
But what we do have to prove, and what we will prove is that the world where men 
dominate the public sphere and where the male traits are the ones that lead to success 
is the world that we are currently saying goodbye to.

We are living through an unprecedented moment in history where the power dynamics 
between men and women are shifting very radically.  I'll start with the fundamentals.  In 
2010, for the first time ever, women became the majority of the work force.  This is kind 
of an amazing fact.   
 
18:55:17 
 
As recently as the 1980s, the working woman was such a cool new sociological 
phenomenon that there were several sitcoms dedicated to her existence, which many of 
you might remember. Now she is the majority of the work force.  If you look back at 
your professional schools that you guys went to, law school, medical school, accounting, 
even business schools, you are likely to find that women are the majority of all of those 
schools.  And last year for the first time, women became 54 percent of all American 
managers.   
 
Now, how are men doing these days?  They're doing very, very badly.  The annual 
income of men peaked around 1973, which is just when women started to get going.  
Right now, one in five men are out of work, which is the highest percentage that's ever 
existed. 
 
When Larry Summers was recently asked by the New York Times what keeps him up at 
night, you would think he would have mentioned the healthcare crisis or maybe the 
many, many gaps he has made over his long career, but he did not mention either of 
those things.  What he mentioned was this one in five ratio which he described as 
having vast social consequences. 
 
18:56:17 
 
Now, why is this happening?  The very simple answer is college.  Most economists agree 
that what you need to get ahead these days is pretty simple.  It's just a college degree.  
But women, for some reason, are much better these days at getting college degrees 
than men.  For every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. 
 
So why are women getting more college degrees?  It's not that women are smarter 
because they're not smarter.  These days, men and women test about the same on 
standardized tests for both math and English.  But women have something.  Some 
sociologists call it grit, some call it engagement, some call it focus, some call it social 
intelligence.  It's some special formula that's required for success these days, which 
women just seem to have in greater abundance than men.  And this is a very new thing. 
 
Now, I imagine that our opponents are going to concede that women do better in 
college.  But then they're going to say so what?  Women are goody goodies, then they 
go to work, and they just flame out, and they never get anywhere else.  But this is, of 
course, completely preposterous.

18:57:15 
 
For one thing, it's only been happening for about a generation and a half, and you 
already see the results in the economy.  You already see that for women under 30 these 
days are making more money than men under 30.  And that's really, really new.  Also 
women are getting much more aggressive than they ever were, which is something 
that's brand new.  And also the qualities that we think of as making a great leader are 
starting to be defined as more feminine than masculine which is something that my 
partner is going to talk about later.   
 
So now you really have to be blind not to see the effects of this all around us in the 
culture. We've all gotten used to the new guy antihero or what my friend at Slate calls 
the omega male who's two rungs below the alpha in the wolf pack.  And so we see him 
in the Judd Apatow movies, we see him in the Bud Light commercials.  He's sitting 
around, putting his feet up, drinking beers, basically not working and not sure what to 
do with his life, he's still wearing Keds and a band T-shirt even though he's well into his 
40s and at an age where men in generations before were already picking their kids up 
from college.   
 
18:58:17 
 
I just spent the last couple of weeks watching the new sitcoms for the new TV season.  
The theme for this TV season was called by TV Guide the emasculation of men, and here 
again you have lots and lots of guys playing videogames while their wives work, 
sometimes they work double shifts, their wives are working powerhouse jobs, and 
they're coming home to see their husbands play videogames.  One of the guys in the 
sitcoms, one of the characters decided that he was going to bestow his business upon 
his granddaughter and not his grandson because his granddaughter had an MBA from 
Purdue and his grandson as he put it was a jet skiing idiot.  
 
[laughter] 
 
So this is the middle class's reflection of itself these days.  Now we're on to my favorite 
subject which is male vanity, the new male vanity. 
 
[laughter] 
Lose your guts, 30 red hot sex secrets.  Dave Zinczenko will recognize these phrases 
because they come from the cover of his magazine, Men's Health.

Once upon a time men's magazines used to actively flaunt their dominance and 
aggression. The very first issue of Playboy called women people who crush man's 
adventurous free loving spirit.  These days they seem to flaunt male insecurity.  Men are 
fueling the rise in plastic surgery, hair products, and waxes.  If you look at the back at 
the 1986 Sexiest Man Alive, you'll see Mark Harmon who basically looks like an 
orangutan by the standards of the day, he's got hair coming out of his shoulders, coming 
out of his thighs, he's a really big hairy man.  These days the men are waxing and 
primping more than I have ever done in my entire life, as we all became deeply familiar 
with, unfortunately, when we have the close-up of Anthony Weiner. [laughter] 
Now, from my opponents, you'll likely hear a lot of talk about the new generation about 
how men are still geniuses, men are still inventors, how they drive the technology 
industry.   
 
19:00:18  
 
I have a few things to say to that.  First of all, we're talking about a tiny percentage of 
men, and they're more than balanced out by the men at the other end who are 
incarcerated or having trouble in school.  It's perfectly possible that we'll have a handful 
of great inventors and that still broadly speaking men are finished.  You're also likely to 
hear about the Fortune 500 list and at the echelons of Hollywood and how few women 
there are out there at the top.  I hear this argument on nearly every panel that I'm on 
and my answer is always the same, duh, men have been at this for 40,000 years and 
women have only been at this for 40 years, so of course the world doesn't flip upside-
down overnight.  But the writing on the wall is still clear, men are finished, which is why 
you should vote for us. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Hanna Rosin. 
 
[applause] 
 
"Men are finished" is our motion and now here to speak against the motion I'd like to 
introduce Christina Hoff Sommers.   
 
19:01:18  
 
She's a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.  She is a critic of radical 
feminism and the author of The War Against Boys and also Who Stole Feminism?  Does 
the answer to that question figure in to the argument you're going to make here 
tonight? 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Oh, actually it does, in Who Stole Feminism I argued against a very ferocious form of 
male bashing feminism and in favor of a feminism that affirmed friendship and equality 
and mutual respect between the sexes and I'm going to talk a lot about that tonight. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, Christina Hoff Sommers. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
First of all, men are not finished.  Yes, yes, indeed, women are joining men as partners in 
running the world but they're not replacing them.  Women are flourishing in ways which 
are unprecedented, exciting, glorious.  But men have hardly vanished from the limelight.   
 
19:02:19  
 
I mean, after almost 40 years of gender neutral pronouns, men are still more likely than 
women to run for political office, start businesses, file patents, write editorials, tell 
jokes.  They conduct the orchestras.  They direct the great movies.  They blow up things.  
Now, I admit blowing up things is problematic.  I wish they would do less of it.   
Men commit most acts of wanton violence.  But, at the same time, it usually takes other 
men to stop them.   
 
The “males are in decline” crowd seem to imagine a world of consensus-building 
women, happily and confidently interacting and managing the new economy.  They 
point to an explosion of jobs for nurturers and communicators, more social workers, 
veterinarians, dance therapists, teachers.   
 
19:03:17  
 
The problem is that you can’t sustain a network of nurturers and communicators 
without someone paying for it.  You’re still going to need ambitious, hard-driven 
innovators, manufacturers, engineers, construction workers, along with police officers, 
firefighters and the military.  Now, we’re told that toughness and assertiveness, those 
are obsolete, fit for another age, not the 21st century.  That’s absurd.  It’s worse than 
absurd.  It borders on being ungrateful and even elitist.  It ignores the actions and 
virtues of the very people that make it possible for us to assemble here tonight and 
debate whether men are in decline.  It reminds me of a quote by -- well, attributed to 
George Orwell.  Orwell allegedly said, “We sleep peaceably in our beds at night only 
because rough men stand ready to do violence on our behalf.”  Well, the world is still 
dangerous, and our civilization still depends on the protection of brave men and some 
women who are willing to fight and die to protect us.

Now, Hanna concedes that men are still at the top of the pyramid, but she says, quote, 
“Men’s hold on power in elite circles is loosening.”  Loosening?  Yes, of course.  I agree.  
And I welcome it.  But it’s not evidence of a female takeover.  I mean, just think about it.  
Women have amazing talents.  They can be as dazzling as men when they set their 
minds to it.  But the sexes are equal.  But they exercise their equality in different ways.  
Consider science and technology.  Women now hold a majority of college degrees, and 
they hold most of the jobs in fields like psychology, veterinary medicine, biology.  It’s 
quite likely women are not only going to compete with men but surpass them in these 
fields and, indeed, very exciting to behold.   
 
19:05:17  
 
They’re just as competitive as men in those fields, if not more.  But those numbers don’t 
hold in other fields.  Math, technology, engineering -- those are fields where men prevail 
by huge numbers.  “And give them time,” says Hanna.  “Women have only just begun, 
and that women are in ascendancy.  They’re going to gain momentum.”  Where is it?  I 
see no sign of it. According to a recent study by the Commerce Department, women’s 
numbers in computer science and mathematics have actually gone down in the last 10 
years.  I mean, if Hanna were right, these trends -- we would begin to see women taking 
over, or at least showing some progress.  We see no progress, very little progress in 
those fields.  
 
Now, ask yourself, is technology finished?  Is engineering finished?  Is the military 
finished?  Are dangerous jobs like working on an oil rig or being a police officer or a 
roofer, a logger -- are those finished?   
 
19:06:17  
 
Now, it’s true that minimally educated men are in serious trouble.  And I agree very 
much with Hanna that this is a matter of grave concern.  Girls do better than boys in 
school. They get better grades.  They score higher on reading and writing tests.  They’re 
more likely to go to college.  The reason for girls’ educational success, they’re 
complicated and surely have something to do with a complex combination of innate and 
cultural differences.  Teenage girls, for example, tend to pay attention better than 
teenage boys.  But instead of declaring men finished because of their educational 
deficits, we should be looking for ways to make our classrooms friendlier places for boys 
and young men, and more conducive to their success.  
 
Why are we even having this debate about men’s demise?  The reason is we are living in 
an era you could call “WAW,” women are wonderful.   
 
19:07:15

It’s a phenomenon that’s been identified by some psychologists.  And it used to be 
fashionable to celebrate men’s superiority over women when women were truly the 
second sex.  Fortunately, those chauvinist days are long gone.  Today, a new kind of 
reverse chauvinism is in ascendancy, female chauvinism.  Magazines, TV shows, yes, 
sitcoms claim, you know, the endless heroics about girl power, "You go, girl," claiming 
that women are better at everything. Women are better leaders, women are better 
communicators, all around better human beings.  I saw one-story that said women have 
better orgasms than men.  The rules of the WAW game make it impossible for them to -- 
to win, because if women do something better than men, that's evidence of their 
superiority.  If men outperform women, that's proof of discrimination and the 
continuing male culture. 
 
What you see tonight on the other side of the stage is an extreme form of the WAW 
phenomenon. The idea that men are finished is crazy.   
 
19:08:21  
 
Men and women complement each other.  We are not separate teams competing for a 
trophy. This is not a zero sum competition.  We're dance partners like Fred Astaire and 
Ginger Rogers. Our fates are inextricably tied together.  If one is in trouble, so is the 
other.  Several years ago the Hasbro toy company manufactured a toy house.  They 
wanted to manufacture -- they wanted to sell it to both boys and girls.  The girls came 
in, and the boys.  The girls played constructively with the dolls.  The kids took the dolls 
and played house.  The boys catapulted the baby carriage from the roof.  And the 
Hasbro general manager had a brilliant explanation: Boys and girls are different.

19:09:17  
 
Okay.  A reminder of what's going on.  We are halfway through the opening statements 
of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan of ABC News.  We have four 
debaters, two teams of two, who are fighting it out over this motion, men are finished.  
We have heard two of the opening statements and now onto the third.  I'd like to 
introduce Dan Abrams.  He is chief legal analyst for ABC News. 
 
[applause] 
 
He is also the author of a book whose title is a lot of fun to read.  It's called "Man Down: 
Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt that Women are Better Cops, Drivers, Gamblers, 
Spies, World Leaders, Beer Tasters, Hedge Fund Managers and Just About Everything 
Else."  I notice that you don't say women are better legal analysts. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Have you raised the bar for men with your performance? 
 
Dan Abrams: 
No, no, no.  There's just the -- the obvious example of the woman who is a better legal 
analyst. Of course, there's Nancy Grace who's -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Dan Abrams. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
-- my frequent opponent. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:10:20  
 
How the heck did Dan Abrams, a far too old to still be single guy, not particularly known 
as a feminist end up writing a book about female superiority?  Did he do it to meet 
women?  Did he -- did he do it to pander?  You know, it's always frustrating for me when 
I'm asked about a single reason why I wrote the book.  I did it for both reasons, and it's 
worked incredibly well.

[laughter] 
 
Now, it has not had any substantial impact on my social life, and there is no question 
that that sort of silliness is what has gotten my book, "Man Down," far more attention 
than it ever would have received.  I made a case based on evidence and men's rights 
groups and others have attacked me, saying, "He didn't use the scientific method in this 
book."  Look, this book was, at times, a fun, tongue-in-cheek effort.  So I separate it into 
two broad themes, chapters that at least get people reevaluating their preconceived 
notions and others which I think truly prove female superiority.   
 
19:11:22  
 
Can I definitively prove that women are really better spies or competitive eaters or even 
they tolerate pain better than men for certain, or even my beloved chapter on women 
handling breakups better than men?  I presented evidence.  I presented studies, 
research.  But certainly someone on the other side could attack those chapters.  So let's 
put the frivolous aside and talk about the evidence that examines issues that are 
important.  Hanna talked about women as students.  They'll be better educated.  They'll 
navigate tough economies better.  They'll be better equipped for the workplace of the 
next generation.  But I don't know.  What about politics, finance, taking care of the 
planet?  These are areas where the evidence is crystal clear and maybe just as important 
the trends for the future support women and also help explain why women lag in 
certain areas.   
 
19:12:15  
 
Let's start with politics.  Women vote more, period, both in number of votes and the 
percentage of the population.  In terms of registered voters in the year 2000, 61 percent 
of women voted.  58 percent of men.  In 2004, 65-62; 2008, with more women on the 
ballots, by the way, 66-62.  Same thing in midterm elections in 2010.  53 percent of 
those who voted were female.   
 
But wait, they, we are still tending to elect more women -- sorry, more men.  Four out of 
five being elected are men.  In fact, in 2010, women gained no Senate seats.  And for the 
first time in 30 years, lost House seats.  This is true for now.  But once the women voters 
and the men realize how much more effective female leaders are, it will not -- it cannot 
continue.  Men will be if not finished, certainly marginalized, the very first research has 
come out this year evaluating men and women in Congress.   
 
 
19:13:15  
 
The American journal for political science reported this year that from 1984 to 2004 
women won their home districts an average of $49 million more per year than their

male counterparts. Women sponsored more bills.  They cosponsored many more bills.  
They attracted a greater number of cosponsors than their male colleagues.  In addition, 
two Ohio State political science professors tracked every bill passed between 1981 and 
2009 and found that those sponsored by women survived further into the legislative 
process, received more attention and were more likely to be deemed important overall.  
And as political leaders and police officers, for that matter -- you mentioned police 
officers -- women are less corruptible.  Two major international studies, one at the 
World Bank development research group, one from Williams College analyzed data from 
dozens of countries' parliaments, plus a 93-country survey.  They took a count of 
corruption levels within the countries.  They took a count of culture, religion, education.  
The results were clear.   
 
19:14:17  
 
The more women legislators, the less corruption in a legislature.  So what the heck's 
going on? Why aren't there more women?  I think a 2008 Pew research study explains it 
all.  They surveyed 2,250 people, asked them about eight traits key to political leaders 
and whether they thought men or women were superior.  Honesty, overwhelmingly 
women; intelligence, women; hard working tied; compassionate, outgoing, creative, 
overwhelmingly women, women, women; ambition, tied.  The only one of the eight 
relevant traits where men were deemed superior, decisiveness.  In that same study, 
though, only six percent of the respondents felt women made better political leaders.  
Similar results when it came to newscasters.  A rigorous study done, male and female 
news casters reading the exact same message.  The participants agreed that when it 
came from a woman, they viewed it adds more credible.  And yet when those same 
people were asked, are men or women news casters more credible, they said men.   
 
19:15:15  
 
There is only so long men will be able to thrive, much less survive on the fumes of past 
sexism and assumptions. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Now, finance.  You don't need to survey the attitude of the people in finance.  2009 and 
2010, Wall Street Journal and New York Times published articles entitled, "For Mother's 
Day, give her the reins to the portfolio" and "How men's overconfidence hurts them as 
investors."  Both presented multiple statistics that men were taking more risks based on 
less information, buying and selling more often and losing more money.  Female hedge 
fund managers outperformed their male counterparts from 2000 to 2009 according to 
hedge fund research by a whopping three percent.  Business Week reported that when 
the downturn began, funds run by women lost 9.6 percent compared to 19 percent for 
men.  Yes, women are only a fraction of the hedge fund managers.  Maybe they have to 
work harder to get there.  Maybe these are the females who are at the top of the game.

19:16:16  
 
But in the world of finance, numbers should speak for themselves.  And all other things 
equal, anyone who wants to make money out to go with a woman.  Finally, new studies 
show that women are more committed to protecting the planet.  They recycle more.  
They're more likely to be green.  They eat less meat.  They take shorter trips.  In part 
because they give and follow better directions than men.  They take public 
transportation more.  They are also better and safer bus drivers.  They save gas by 
speeding less.  They make more eco purchases.  Heck, God has decided that men are 
finished.  Between 1995 and 2008, 82 percent of lightning strikes were on men. 
 
[laughter] 
 
So bottom line, why are women still lagging in so many areas?  Three reasons:  Married 
or unmarried, they're still primarily responsible for childcare; two, they often lack the 
overconfidence of men; and three, sexism.  When number one may not ever change for 
certain, number two and three will.   
 
19:17:19  
 
They must.  And then us men are in big trouble. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Dan Abrams.  "Men are finished," that is our motion and now here to speak 
against the motion, David Zinczenko, who is executive vice president and editor in chief 
of Men's Health Magazine. 
 
[applause] 
 
He is editorial director of both Women's Health and Prevention Magazine and he's a 
bestselling author.  And Men's Health -- it's about fitness, it's about technology, it's 
about handling your finances, so if men were going down the tubes, you would have 
your finger on the pulse of all of these -- 
 
David Zinczenko: 
We would know, John.  Men aren't finished.  Dan may be finished. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But men aren't finished. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 -

John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, David Zinczenko. 
 
[applause] 
 
David Zinczenko: 
Thank you.  Thank you, John, and thank you, Dan.  I want you to vote against this 
proposition, against this misguided motion because it's preposterous.   
 
19:18:21  
 
Men can't possibly be finished because as all of you know, when men are finished, they 
roll over immediately and go to sleep. 
 
[laughter] 
 
That's not happening.  Clearly men are not rolling over. Now, they will have you believe 
that, that is the case.  It's not, if anything they continue to do what they have always 
done, invent new technology -- makes them smarter -- lead nations, build bridges, drive 
corporations, yes, win elections, and to your point quite sadly, tweet pics of their 
genitalia to complete strangers. That's true.  Nothing's changed.   
 
19:19:17  
 
Now, our opponents are arguing that men have lost their edge, that women now 
outpace men in both graduate and undergraduate degrees while the world's economy 
continues to place greater and greater importance on education.  And men are certainly 
falling behind in this regard as you know through the mancession or great he-cession, 
nearly 78 percent initially of the job losses belong to men, yes.  Men make up the largest 
sector of the unemployed, they are the majority of people in prison, in rehab, the 
majority of people who ought to be in rehab.  And as Jeff Foxworthy might have put it, 
very few women say as their last words, "Hey, watch this."  
 
[laughter] 
 
It's a fact.  Testosterone fueled accidents and testosterone fueled illnesses fell men 
seven years sooner than women. 
 
19:20:21  
 
So how can I concede these points right at the top of this debate and still say you must 
vote against this measure?  It's simple.  All of the statistics that my opponents will be 
citing tonight are indicative of a trend.  Women are beginning to catch up to men.  But 
the pace of that progress is inexorably slow.  According to the United Nations women 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

perform two-thirds of the world's work, but only earn a fraction of the world's income.  
Men own 99 percent of the world's property and rule 92 percent of its sovereign 
nations.  Now, I didn't get through all of Freakonomics, admittedly, but these do not 
seem like winning statistics for that side.  
 
19:21:15  
 
Obviously, the other 150 million American males out there aren't particularly alarmed 
either.  I don't think anybody came through a gauntlet of men protesting the topic of 
this debate out there burning their jockstraps. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Men aren't finished.  You have to vote against this motion.  Now, what's going on?  In 
part it's the biological drive.  There is a women's movement for the simple reason that 
women are willing to move together more as a unit.  Men are rugged individualists.  
They want to move together probably but they -- none is willing to stop and ask for 
directions.  So that's the way that men are, and we need to move beyond our 
opponents' assertions that there's something wrong with that.   
 
19:22:12  
 
It may not be true that the male of the species is in fact stronger, braver, or more action 
oriented in times of crisis, but we are certainly still asked to play an outsize role.  It was 
still men who spent those long weeks in the Chilean mine.  It’s still men who make up 90 
percent of the on-the-job deaths, performing dangerous tasks at dangerous hours. It 
was still 343 firemen who lost their lives 10 years ago in the World Trade Center.  And 
while women are clearly capable of heroic actions in desperate circumstances, I 
personally am in awe of Rupert Murdoch’s wife. 
 
[laughter] 
 
We are hard-wired as a species to count on the comforts of masculine leadership.  Even 
women who aspire to become leaders often seem to take on the trappings of 
masculinity.  Consider Sarah Palin who dobbed such masculine traits as wearing black 
leather jackets, carrying a gun, bragging about how hot her spouse is.   
 
19:23:21  
 
Or Michele Bachmann whose tribute to traditional masculinity includes putting down 
gays and trying to pretend our daughters are still virgins. 
 
[laughter]

Yes, women are making enormous gains in education.  They now earn the majority of 
graduate and undergraduate degrees.  And I feel terrible, just terrible, for Bill Gates and 
Barry Diller and Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg and Tyler Perry and Larry Ellison and 
Steve Jobs and all the other poor non-degree-holding men who were too busy becoming 
billionaires to finish their homework.  Awful.  It’s so tough.  It would have been much 
better -- 
 
[applause] 
 
It would have been much better if they had just stayed at home, stayed in school, taken 
on their share of the more than $1 trillion in student loan debt, the majority of which 
now belongs to -- you guessed it -- the fairer sex.   
 
19:24:23  
 
Of course, there’s self-made women billionaires -- Oprah, Martha, J.K. Rowling, 
imaginative visions shared worldwide.  But it’s men who flood the patent offices with 
their big ideas.  And until a woman invents the next Google or Facebook or iPad or bass-
o-matic -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- the economic inequality between men and women will not be righted in our lifetimes.  
So, men are driven to achieve power and influence.  Men aren’t worried about losing 
out to women. They’re still too focused on not losing out to other men.  That’s why men 
are not finished.  And it’s why you have to vote against this ridiculous proposition. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, David Zinczenko. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:25:16  
 
And that concludes round one of this U.S. Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the 
motion being debated is "Men are finished."  All right, so we’re going to move on to 
round two, and this is one of those times when I would solicit your highly spontaneous 
applause. 
 
[applause] 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Welcome back to this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I’m John Donvan of ABC News.  
We’re at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.  Our motion 
is "Men are finished," and we have two teams debating this motion.  We have Hanna 
Rosin and Dan Abrams arguing for the motion that "Men are finished."  They’re saying 
that as a result of a changing economy and shifting cultural values, men who once, like it 
or not, were seen as the dominant sex, the bosses and the breadwinners, are now 
already in a deep slide to number two status.  Arguing against them, saying that men are 
not finished, Christina Hoff Sommers and David Zinczenko.  They’re saying that men are 
doing just fine, thank you, that they still hold most of the power.  And besides, just 
because women are doing better, that does not mean that men have to be doing worse.  
 
19:26:21  
 
We’re in round two where the debaters are going to be able to talk directly to each 
other and take questions from you and from myself and from readers of Slate who are 
watching this debate online.  And I’d like to start with initially with a question to the side 
that’s arguing for the motion, and I think perhaps to you, Hanna Rosin.  Your opponents 
are making the case that part of the reason that the notion is afloat, that "Men are 
finished," is because there’s an attitude about, there’s a sense that women can only be 
doing better if men are doing worse, that this is a zero-sum game.  So is it?  Is it not 
possible for both sides to do well without this imbalance resulting? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
It is possible, but it just doesn’t work that way.  I mean, if we can all agree that there 
was male dominance for a long time and that male dominance is over, then I think we 
agree that men are finished.  So the resolution is about male dominance which we’ve 
taken for granted for so many tens of thousands of years.   
 
19:27:20  
 
And so, even if you have parity, you have the end of male dominance.  I mean, if you 
have women rising and catching up to men, then you no longer have male dominance.  
And so that's what I meant when I, early on, tried to define the resolution as men are 
finished, the era of male dominance, it's finished, which we've taken for granted for all 
this time. 
 
John Donvan: 
Christina Hoff Sommers. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
But the opposite of male dominance is not female dominance.  It's mutuality. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

That's fine.  Men are still finished.  I mean, men are finished as the dominant sex.  I'm 
not -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
They are not finished.  That's absurd.  You agreed to it in your opening that you didn't 
want to say men are finished.  You thought there might be inklings of a suggestion that 
it may be happening.  But what you're defending now is that men are finished.  I'm 
saying it's absurd. I'm saying that some men are in trouble.  But rather than declare their 
extinction, we should be doing what we can to help them.  And that is -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Totally. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
-- not happening in our schools.  Our schools are -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
I'm not saying we should crush them further.  I mean -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, let's talk about -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Dan Abrams. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
You say we need to -- we need to do that in our schools, and yet that's exactly what 
universities have tried, which is to have affirmative action for men.   
 
19:28:22  
 
It's gotten that bad.  And the problem is that the civil rights -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Wait.  Why are they laughing?  This is true. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Yeah. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Schools have affirmative action for men. 
 
Dan Abrams: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

No, and the civil rights commission actually investigated this, and may investigate it 
again because the situation has gotten so dire at our universities that we feel the need 
to discriminate against women.  Is that the solution?  That's frightening. 
 
John Donvan: 
Christina. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
The civil rights commission chose not to investigate it.  It never happened, but -- 
 
Dan Abrams: 
No, they did investigate it. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
They -- they did not.  They did not. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
They -- I know -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
However, they -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
-- [unintelligible] as to why they shut down the investigation and -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
It doesn't matter. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
-- believe me -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
They shut it down. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
-- you don't want to get into why they shut [unintelligible]. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Because they did not want to get into it and -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let's move forward on the impasse.  Let's move forward. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Let's not have an impasse.  But if you look at the early grades as how young men are 
treated in our schools, it's a very girl friendly environment.  And boys are not keeping up 
with -- with the girls. 
 
John Donvan: 
But does that mean boys are finished? 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
We had massive effort -- well -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But seriously, is that -- is that not -- Christina, is that not indicative of -- of their 
argument that the system is set up in such a way that males, let's say, are on a bad 
track? 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Males aren't on a bad track.   
 
19:29:27  
 
But our system is rigged against them.  And if you look into the average classroom, it's a 
male averse environment.  Schools, for example, now don't allow rough and tumble 
play.  There is zero tolerance for male rambunctiousness.  You have schools where they 
don't allow them to play tag where anyone is out.  They have to replace it with games 
like circle of friends, tug-of-war.  Tug-of-war has become tug of peace.  This is not -- this 
is hostile to the interests of young men.  And it gets more serious if you look at the 
readings.  A friend of mine at Harvard graduate school of education did a content 
analysis of textbooks, readers for eighth and -- seventh and eighth grade social studies 
class.  She said you'd think the American West was settled by teenage girls traveling 
with parents.  So male heroes have been taken out.  Boys are badly neglected. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Now -- just one last point.   
 
19:30:16  
 
We did a lot to help girls and to strengthen them in math and science.  At the same 
time, we did nothing to help boys with their reading and writing skills and their college 
matriculation -- 
 
Dan Abrams: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

But it seems like you're -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Dan Abrams. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
-- conceding that men are finished.  I mean, what you're doing is you're saying, yes, men 
are finished, and here's why we need to change it. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
I said men are in trouble.  That's not the same as saying they are finished. 
 
John Donvan: 
David -- David Zinczenko. 
 
David Zinczenko: 
I mean, I would just say that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
David, could you move just a tiny bit to -- 
 
David Zinczenko: 
I mean, what's happening here is what needs to happen.  They are on the ridiculous side 
of this issue.  So they have to attempt to redefine it.  If the issue is that the stranglehold 
on men is coming to the end or men omnipotence is finished, well, two things would be 
happening.  We would be conceding right off the bat that men's omnipotence is 
finished, and this debate would be taking place in 1962, okay.  The fact is that, at this 
point, we have come to accept a shared power structure between men and women.   
 
19:31:18  
 
And it really doesn't matter.  It's not the issue that we're really discussing here, which is 
why you have to vote against this motion. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Wait.  What was that phrase you used, surviving off the fumes of sexism?  I think we are 
our finest example there. 
 
[laughter] 
 
David Zinczenko: 
Well, I'm -- 
 
John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

David Zinczenko.  Oh, you want to concede to Hanna Rosin.  I think you scored on that 
one. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
I want to make another point about police officers which Christina made a reference to 
consistently, and I think it's indicative, actually, of the larger issue, which is people like 
to think, oh, you know, men will be the better police officers because they're bigger and 
stronger.  And if I was out there, and I needed someone, I'd want a big, strong police 
officer.  Well, okay in certain cases.  But what if I told you that there is solid evidence to 
demonstrate that women can defuse a violent situation better than men can?  Hmm.  
Okay.  Now instead of having to tackle the guy, you can get the guy to a -- you can avoid 
a conflict altogether and then avoid taxpayer lawsuits and have less corruption within 
your police force.   
 
19:32:23  
 
Hmm.  Suddenly we're looking at police officers in a totally different way.  Does that 
mean that there's no advantage to being faster or bigger?  No.  But the number of times 
in real life as opposed to the movies where people are actually sort of running down 
across the street to catch the guy jumping over the fence is actually pretty far -- you 
know, it's pretty rare. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
All right, well -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Christina Hoff Sommers. 
 
[applause] 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
First of all, don't trust Dan and -- and his statistics.  He is -- he has a fairly serious case of 
-- 
 
David Zinczenko: 
And he's a columnist for Men's Health magazine.  He has the hardest time getting his 
pieces through our fact-checking department. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Dan --

He is so fired, yeah, yeah.  It's ridiculous. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Did you not say -- didn't you not claim in your book that women have better physical 
endurance?  Did you not claim that women could take pain better than men? 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Yes. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Both of these things are false.  There is a vast library of literature -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Childbirth.  Childbirth.  Childbirth. 
 
19:33:19  
 
[laughter] 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Epidural, epidural, invented by men. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Yes.  Sorry.  What's the question? 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Endurance, physical endurance. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Yeah. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
You think that women have better physical endurance. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
That's that there is an advantage that women have with estrogen and fat that provides 
them an advantage -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Fat? 
 
Dan Abrams: 
It's true, yes.

[laughter] 
 
It's true. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
I rest my case. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
It allows -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
I rest my case. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
It allows women to engage certain endurance activities better and longer than men.  
That does not mean they're faster. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Name one activity. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
I'll tell you one.  In the -- in the ultra marathons is the only race where women can beat 
men, okay?  This is -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Don't clap.  He's just wrong.  He's got to be -- 
 
Dan Abrams: 
It's not true?  Am I making it up? 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
You are making it up. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
-- that a woman won the ultra marathon.  It's the only sport where men versus women, 
that women -- I didn't say always win.  Women can win. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Oh, one woman won in the Mojave Desert a couple of years ago. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
But wait a sec.  Wait a sec.  There's a -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

There's a huge record -- 
 
Dan Abrams: 
-- fact that a woman beat a man in an athletic competition is unheard of.   
 
19:34:19  
 
The bottom line is men are still better athletes than women.  Men are stronger than 
women, and they're faster than women.  But the one area where women can compete 
is in areas where it requires excessive endurance.  And these ultra marathons are 135 
miles plus. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Just to stop this discussion, there's some very good articles that have come out in recent 
years. Just look at Richard Coast at Northern Arizona University who did a definitive 
study to undue this myth that was born in the '90s where they predicted women -- it 
came in Nature magazine. They predicted women were going to win the marathon in 
1998.  It came and went.  Women didn't win. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
They're not going to win the marathon.  They're not.  The bottom line is men are -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
And they're not winning the ultra marathon. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
No, it's not true. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
And what Coast and other experts say is the longer and the -- the test of endurance, the 
greater the gap favoring males.  You've just got it wrong.  You've got your facts wrong. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
It's not wrong.  The reality -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  We're going to move past on that one.  Okay.  What about billiards? 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Sorry? 
 
Female Speaker: 
Billiards.

Dan Abrams: 
Oh, billiards.  Billiards, yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Christina, I want to put a question to you -- a question to you.   
 
19:35:22  
 
You -- you talked about fields where men's, I would say, brawn is relevant; firefighters, 
the people who protect us, soldiers.  You mentioned loggers.  And -- and they're kind of 
creating a world where they're saying it's -- it's more important now to be a blogger 
than to be a logger, that -- that there is -- that it's a Facebook world, and the Facebook 
world works better for women in many different ways, the social skills, et cetera.  So I 
just wanted you to take on that notion that structurally we're changing so that the 
relevance of female characteristics to the economy, their economic value has become 
enhanced, while male so-called characteristics, brawn, for example -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
I don't disagree with Dan or Hanna that there -- there's a female ascendancy which I find 
as exciting as -- both as a woman and grandmother of Eliza.   
 
19:36:18  
 
I like to see these opportunities for women and women moving into centers of power.  
But again, I insist that what they're doing is forging a partnership with men in running 
the world. They're not taking over.  And -- and women are men are equal but different.  
And I think women are dazzling but in different ways.  And so if I had been allowed to 
finish when I was up there instead of -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Now -- now you -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
-- only a woman was not allowed [unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no, now you've got that moment, so I would take it. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
When I talked about the boys and girls with the doll house, and the boys catapulted the 
baby carriage from the roof, even when -- when men and women get older, there's this 
complementarity.  We still need the catapulters.  We still need the nurturers.  Typically 
if a parent -- you know, a father and mother go to a park with a child and there's a 
jungle gym, the mother will say, "Be careful."  The father will say, "Can you get to the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

top?" I think that we need both the nurturers and the catapulters and that the idea that 
we're going to have one over the other is unknown and can -- 
 
19:37:17  
 
John Donvan: 
But the notion that the -- that so-called feminism qualities which would include what, 
Hanna, become more relevant economically? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
You know, I'm so reluctant to enter this WAW women are wonderful -- how do we say it 
-- debate?  I mean, I don't know that women are particularly awesome, like when I enter 
this bloggers versus loggers conversation, this isn't a value judgment like loggers are 
losers, it's not the -- that's not the motto -- 
 
John Donvan: 
The loggers are going to be so relieved to hear you. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Loggers are not losers, we'll make the T-shirt after this debate, that's not what our side 
represents, it's just that they're an incredibly shrinking part of the American economy.  
It just is. It's really not a value judgment; it's like whatever it is that women have -- you 
know, people have called it so many things.  They've called it grit.  They've called it 
emotional intelligence.  They've called it focus.  Nobody really knows what it is.  Some 
people try to say, like, oh, it's in the hardwiring of the brains of women.  I'm not sure it's 
in the -- it might be that women have been behind all these years and now they're 
catching up the way immigrants do, it might be that, but it's just an economic fact that 
whatever it is [inaudible] -- 
 
19:38:19  
 
Hanna Rosin: 
I just have a question for Hanna -- 
 
John Donvan: 
David, and then go -- 
 
David Zinczenko: 
Well, if you look at all of the relevant stats, what you see is this is not the case, that 
when you look at concentrations of wealth, when you look at poverty in the United 
States and elsewhere, the deck has been stacked against women.  That is not good.  We 
need more gender equality.  But in their world they have to twist what this debate 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

means. And the fact is if men adjust to the work life realities, they are emasculated and 
feminized and therefore they lose.  If they don't adapt to the new reality, men are 
emasculated and unnecessary and irrelevant and antiquated, and they lose.   
 
19:39:12  
 
So I think women can become CEOs, they can become stay at home moms, they can be 
considered masters of the new universe, and it is easy to structure in your mind the 
decline and fall of men when in your own mind when all the rules are stacked against 
your opponents, but here in the real world there is no truth to the facts. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, let me put the questions here aside then, in this -- we're talking about a process 
and we're talking about possibly being in the early stages of the process of male loss of 
dominance to women, so what is the endgame?  Thirty years from now if this process 
continues and accelerates, where are men as you imagine it, I mean, are we all wearing 
diapers in a closet somewhere or -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- where are we in the picture if this continues? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Where did the diapers come from? 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Infantilization. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
I get it, infantilization, well, I mean, you want to talk about the saddest part of this?  
When you guys say something like "logger," you make it sound like it's a very tiny 
minute percentage of the population.   
 
19:40:17  
 
We're actually talking about 60 percent of the population that's not college educated, 
okay?  So you keep mentioning Bill Gates.  This is the American middle class, okay?  You 
tap into the American middle class, I've done a lot of reporting on this issue, it is actually 
sad.  I mean, you see that women are holding up these families, they're in community 
colleges, the men are struggling, and for some reason they're not getting the message 
that they have to go to school. So I think we can be in one of two different places.  The 
men could start getting the message that they have to retool themselves, that the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

factories that their fathers worked for are not going to be there anymore and that they 
have to do something different, and then we'll end up in a situation that's closer to 
parity.   
 
Or you could end up in a situation where it gets worse and worse and worse and the 
income -- you know, you have a sort of little upper class of people that these guys are 
talking about that consists of Bill Gates and maybe the people in this audience and not 
very many more people and everybody else is sort of struggling with the women holding 
the bag, it's called the last bag theory where the woman because she's raising the child 
is also going to school and making the money and the men are just sort of struggling and 
out of work. 
 
19:41:19  
 
Dan Abrams: 
I would just add to that, the bigger problem I think for men is the unwillingness to take 
what have been viewed as classically female jobs, teachers, nurses, or healthcare 
professionals, et cetera, and that's the area where if you want to talk about how do we 
make this better, how do we end -- how do we reverse men being finished, which they 
are -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- how do we reverse that?  Well, part of it has got to be that men are going to have to 
start accepting some of these jobs that have not been classically viewed as male.  And I 
mean think about -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Oh, may I say something that I -- 
 
Dan Abrams: 
-- think about the Ben Stiller movie where he plays a male nurse, right, and everyone's 
like well he's a male nurse, ha, ha. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
About six miles, seven miles from here is a high school called Aviation High School, and 
it's got 2,000 students approximately, you go into that school, whereas at most schools, 
kids are detached and not paying attention, at Aviation they are enthralled.   
 
19:42:22  
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

You walk into that high school and you think all the kids are gone because it's so quiet.  
It's the quietest place in New York City.  It's there the kids have to do academic courses, 
but they can spend half the day working on airplanes.  They build mainframes and so 
forth.  Now it has one defect.  It’s 87 percent male.  And so the women’s lobby in 
Washington has put it on a hit list. Aviation High School has one of the best graduation 
rates.  Most of the kids going there are from -- their African American and Hispanic kids 
living under the poverty line, and their chances of graduating are vastly higher than in 
any other school, very high college matriculation rate. That is a school that is working, 
but it now more likely to be investigated rather than replicated. People come to study 
this school from Finland and Ireland, but in the United States they’re more likely to be 
visited with a Title 9 lawsuit because we’re not helping young men find jobs that they 
might find interesting and be suited for.   
 
19:43:22  
 
The -- and I’m not talking about feminists.  Feminists are -- in my book, I talked about 
lots of different styles of feminism, and they’re not in favor of this.  This is the Women’s 
Lobby in Washington, which is carried away with a very hostile agenda and working 
against helping young men.  That’s the problem.  Young men aren’t getting the help. 
 
John Donvan: 
But how does that not help their argument? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Yes, yes, because what Christina is saying is proof-- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
--the system is rigged against them.  They haven’t been defeated. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Yes, because they’re finished. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no, no.  Christina, finish -- let Christina finish the point. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
No, to say that the system is rigged against them is not to say they’re finished.  It’s 
saying they’re operating under a very severe handicap.  And instead of using all of your 
creativity and energy to argue for this absurd proposition that men are finished, you 
should be doing something to alleviate the problem that’s leading to their struggle.   
 
19:44:13  
 
Hanna Rosin: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Well, acknowledging that this true would be the first step to helping them.   
 
It wouldn’t be that, you know, we would want them to be down -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Look, if men are finished, we’re all finished, so let’s not go there. 
 
John Donvan: 
David Zinczenko. 
 
David Zinczenko: 
Well, I -- you know, I was just going to add that it’s kind of silly too to say that men will 
need to learn how to adopt female characteristics to survive, whether it’s moving into 
jobs like interior decorating or health care providing or these counselors.  I mean, I think 
that Sigmund Freud and Nate Berkus and Dr. Christian Bernard would disagree with the 
assertion. The guys are moving too -- 
 
Dan Abrams: 
The men will be unemployed.  I mean, it’s a simple choice.  They will remain then 
unemployed.  
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
In a world where men do, say, fill the positions of school teachers and nurses such as 
they don’t now, in the vision that you’re saying would be the solution, would they still 
be dominant? 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Well, look, the bottom line is dominance.  How do we define that?  I will tell you that 
health care will become a dominant industry.  It’s becoming -- it already is -- but it’s 
becoming an even more dominant industry in our country and in our world.   
 
19:45:22  
 
If men are simply saying “I’m not playing in that industry,” and women are saying “I’ll 
play in any industry, I don’t care what it is.  I’m going to do what it takes to make it 
work,” then men are going to be at a distinct advantage and are going to remain 
finished. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
But this also gets to the heart of the problem.  I mean, historically what’s happened is 
that women have operated pretty flexibly.  They’ve gone in a very short period of time 
from not being able to work when they were married to not being able to work when 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

they had little kids, to being able to work whenever they wanted in a vast number of 
professions.  I can name a number of professions that have gone from entirely male to 
entirely female.  And you can’t name any that have gone the other way around.  Why?  
Because men operate in a narrower range at this point in time.  That doesn’t mean that 
they always will, but at this point in time, they’re just not that flexible about their 
identities. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  I want to come to the audience for questions shortly, but first I want to mention 
this, as I mentioned before.   
 
19:46:12  
 
We’re very pleased to have Slate as our media partner, and they’re streaming this 
debate -- thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
And they’re live streaming this debate on their site, and we have a question from a 
William Nitrous of New York City who I’m going to slightly paraphrase.  He’s saying is 
this just a natural consequence -- I’m thinking what he means to say is this perception 
that perhaps men are finished, is it just a natural consequence of the assumption of 
superiority among men who, unlike females, didn’t have the pressure of needing a 
college degree to succeed?  And the more interesting part of his question, he says, 
“Does this apply outside of America?”  So I want to put to both sides the cultural aspect 
of that question.  To what degree are we talking about an American phenomenon here 
and to what degree is it more global? 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Well, men are languishing academically throughout the world.  In most countries in 
Europe, far more women go to college -- I mean, more women go to college than men in 
Iran, so it’s not only the United States.   
 
19:47:15  
 
But what’s true is that the United States, we’re having a hard time finding ways to help 
young men. 
 
John Donvan: 
Hanna Rosin. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Men are languishing in all countries of the world. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Academically. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Academically, their language -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Oh, no, no, not politically, no way. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Well, what -- you know, so here's an interesting statistic.  So we always think -- male 
preference is something that comes up a lot.  You know, preference for the first born 
son.  One of the first things I did when I started this research was, on a lark and a tip, I 
went to go visit fertility clinics because, you know, we all understand that people prefer 
sons.  And it turns out that, no, 75 percent of couples are actually requesting girls.  So 
then I started to ask, well, is this true in these very patriarchal places like South Korea, 
China and India?  Well, you look at the charts, and here's what happened.  At some 
point, technology allowed them, you know, to easily choose a son.  And then by the mid 
'90s, this plummeted.  Women started to go to school.  Women started to get jobs that 
they could never have before.  And all these strict patriarchal structures started to break 
down.  So you can see all over the world that different things are happening.   
 
19:48:16  
 
I mean, China, for example, has a higher percentage of female CEOs than the U.S. does.  
Why?  I think it's because childcare is easier.  I think it's because families take care of 
children. There's all sorts of reasons why culturally that's true. 
 
John Donvan: 
Chinese men finished? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Eventually. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, let's go -- no, take it, Christina, go ahead. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
I’m sorry, do you think that Americans prefer to have female children? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Well, the difference is when you poll them and ask them what they want, they say we 
want a son.  When they actually choose, they choose girls. 
 
David Zinczenko: 
It's amazing.  This is the consistent theme again -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
No, no.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, because she's overlooking something.  When they 
actually choose, you're talking about women who go to fertility clinics. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
But that's the only place that keeps statistics. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
But -- but -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Fertility clinics have to write down for the FDA exactly what everybody else -- exactly 
what everybody does.  And they keep the only reliable statistics.  I mean, you can ask 
them, well, what do people want, and they'll say a certain thing.  But -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
But it's mostly -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
-- it's not recorded. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
That's kind of -- that's led by women and slightly older women and the Gallup Poll kept 
records for -- since 1941, and you found a distinct preference for males.   
 
19:49:21  
 
It hasn't changed since 1941. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
That's what people say.  It's just not what they do. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  But let's go to the audience for some questions now.  What you do is, if you raise 
your hand, I'll find you.  Wait until -- please stand up.  A microphone will be brought to 
you.  Hold the microphone about a fist's distance away from your mouth so that the 
radio can hear you.  And identify yourself.  And if you're part of a relevant organization, 
you know what I mean by that, or news organization, please let us know.  We'd just like 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

to know that.  And please make it a question that's terse, focused and on topic and that 
has a question mark at the end.  You didn't have to sit down because I was making that 
long speech. 
 
Alicia Bonner: 
Hello.  My name Alicia Bonner, and I am a graduate of a girl's high school, a women's 
college. And I earn a percent more than my fiancé.  I am interested in a couple of the 
things that David and Christina posed and hearing, Dan and Hanna, your responses.   
 
19:50:18  
 
David, you spoke about financial inequality and how -- whatever, 92 percent of the 
world's resources are in the hands of men and X percent of the countries in the world 
are governed by men.  Christina, you seem to allude to the fact that anything that 
women are able to do, it's because men are there to earn money to fund it, which I 
think might be a little bit more problematic.  But Dan, you also mentioned that people 
on the whole -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Could -- 
 
Alicia Bonner: 
I'm getting there. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- focus it to a question shortly. 
 
Alicia Bonner: 
The -- the -- they say that, um, you know, they say, yes, I like the way women sound, but 
I like male news casters better.  How do we overcome this, yes in the middle class, you 
know, women -- women are holding the bag, as you say.  But at the upper level, at the 
most visible levels, and if money talks, when is that power going to lie with women? 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah, take it, Dan Abrams, first. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
I think that eventually the results are going to speak for themselves.   
 
19:51:18  
 
When people start thinking about and hearing about and learning about how much 
more effective female political leaders are, for example, I think that there will be a 
change.  People will vote differently.  Remember, when people say to me, well, why are 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

there so many -- look, women should be blaming themselves with regard to voting 
because women are the majority of the voters out there.  But what's interesting is, 
when you get more female candidates, you don't necessarily get a change with regard 
to the voting habits of women.  So the answer to your question, is I think when it comes 
to newscasters, when it comes to political leaders, and I think in a lot of these other 
areas, in finance, I think that ultimately the results will speak for themselves.  And that's 
part of the reason why I think this proposition of men are finished -- you know, while 
certainly hyperbole, if you look at the results, it's a dangerous world upcoming, not 
today, a dangerous world coming for men. 
 
John Donvan: 
Other side?   
 
19:52:19  
 
David? 
 
David Zinczenko: 
I mean, I think buildings are always going to fall down.  Things are going to burn.  You're 
always going to need men to get in there and do the dirty jobs, do the dangerous jobs.  
The world is becoming more dangerous than ever.  I think that a lot of the leaders of the 
world as we discussed are men.  And I think the -- you have to get the country running 
right here first. You have to focus on health and wellness.  I think that universal 
healthcare is a step in the right direction.  Men and women are partners.  And once that 
happens, but it's a long ways away right now, you're right, it's 16 percent of women are 
in Congress.  16 percent of women are serving on the board of corporations.  So there's 
a lot of work that needs to be done.  
 
19:53:18  
 
But we have to do it together.  And that's -- and we have to do it here first. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Sir?  You're holding two fingers up.  Yep. 
 
Male Speaker: 
To Dan and Hanna, even as women take over, if you will -- and I agree the trends are 
there. There's no question about it -- wouldn't there be inevitably a sort of market 
adjustment whereby men will learn from women how to be better CEOs, how to be 
better political leaders, better administrators, better members of society and that 
ultimately, it won't mean that anybody's finished, but that there will be a balancing and 
an improvement. 
 
John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Christina, why don't you take that first, and then we'll come to the other side. 
 
[applause] 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Yes, I don't disagree that there is going to be transformation.  This debate is not about 
whether or not we're in a period of transformation and men's and women's roles are 
changing.  Of course they are.   
 
19:54:15  
 
So I'm not contesting that.  What I'm contesting is this very aggressive, dramatic 
resolution, defended by my colleagues that men are finished.  So I pose that.  But as far 
as men improving, I think they will.  I think -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Hanna Rosin. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
-- they always have had -- face challenges and -- and hard times and overcome them, 
and they will do the same now. 
 
John Donvan: 
Hanna Rosin. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
That's the best-case scenario, and that's what I wish would happen.  However, like I said, 
there's just all this evidence that men don't respond that well and are not that flexible.  
People, like she says, people have measured things for many, many years about male 
preference. People have measured male feelings about male identity.  Now, female 
feelings about what's okay as a woman, and people have measured this for college 
students and adults have changed radically.  Women now think it's much more okay to 
be aggressive in the workplace. It's much more okay to win.  They ask a series of 
questions.  The male identification hasn't -- self-identification hasn't changed basically in 
60 years.   
 
19:55:18  
 
Men always think it's only acceptable to be a guy in this tiny, narrow range.  And they're 
always defining themselves against women, not towards women, where women are 
always doing the opposite, which is they're defining themselves as more aggressive, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

competitive, et cetera.  Why?  I don't know why.  I don't know if that's biology or what.  
But that's just how it is.  So we would hope so, but we don't know. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sir, right in the aisle there.  And I just want to mention that if you're in an area where 
you can't see the numbers on your wristwatch, I can't see you because you're -- the 
lights aren't bright enough.  So that if you are in that area where it's darker, and you 
want to ask a question, if you could move down, I might have a chance to find you.  Sir, 
go ahead.  Can you identify yourself? 
 
Male Speaker: 
My name is Aaron, and the group that I am a part of is men with a bachelor's degree.  
That's the relevant group that I'm a part of. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Bachelor's degree, by the way, may be overdue for a name change.  But -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
I can't believe we never thought of that before. 
 
John Donvan: 
I think you deserve a round of applause for that. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:56:17  
 
Male Speaker: 
Wow.  I wasn't planning to start the standup comedy till next week. 
 
[laughter] 
 
I look at this, I see a man and a woman -- a man and a woman, but one style of debate 
here, one style of debate here.  And I'm -- and it just seems that men are finished is just 
an unfortunate title since both groups seem to be saying it's more about traits.  And so 
my question is, is it -- could it be more men who have more feminine traits, who -- or 
traditionally feminine traits, who are succeeding.  And I'm thinking of people like Bill 
Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, and are succeeding for that reason.  Could they then 
potentially reverse the trend and be more successful than women because there are the 
-- 
 
John Donvan: 
What are the feminine traits, though, that you would have in mind?

Male Speaker: 
Well, I'm just -- what they've been saying, that women pay attention more, they're more 
patient, they're better at certain things. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  All right.  I hear your question then.   
 
19:57:16  
 
Why don't we take it first to Dan Abrams. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Just so I understand, what -- do I -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I think your question is, if more men could be more like women -- 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Yeah, look.  There's -- no, no, no, no.  
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Dan Abrams: 
That's actually a fair point. 
 
Look, I'll take that serious.  I don't mean to --[inaudible]  You want to ask anything else? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Well, I -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no, go ahead, just take it then because -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
It's not men acting more like women just because they want to act like women or 
learning to act like women, it's men who do by nature -- like I feel like people told me 
that I have traits that are more like a woman personality-wise, not physically and my 
voice -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Not your hair, it's not your hair they're talking about.

Male Speaker: 
-- but just a matter of -- and men are already in the positions of power and then men in 
positions of power who want to keep men in power change the rules of the game or in 
some way -- but ultimately yes, men with more feminine traits succeeding because 
people are embracing more feminine traits, okay. 
 
19:58:20  
 
Dan Abrams: 
I'll say this, that in the world of finance there is a clear recognition that the traders need 
to behave more classically female, meaning that they are now being trained at many 
classically male financial firms to engage in behavior, consensus building, less of the sort 
of typically male buying and trading like crazy, taking risks, and becoming a bit more risk 
averse, et cetera, to improve long term performance.  Again, getting back to some of 
the statistics that I laid out, that's as a result of risk aversion, now, that doesn't -- that 
means if you're going to swing for the homerun every time, you're going to hit that 
homerun more often and you're also going to strike out more often.   
 
19:59:12  
 
And yet if you behave more in what is viewed as classically female, more risk averse, 
you're going to end up with more -- and to use the sports analogy -- singles, doubles, 
and triples, and as a result have better returns, so just -- 
 
John Donvan: 
David, do you want to respond to that? 
 
David Zinczenko: 
I think you're a superior human being who is adapting, that's exactly what's going on.  
 
[laughter] 
 
You are adopting certain traits that will help you survive and excel.  There is nothing 
wrong with that.  What is unfortunate is the argument cannot -- of women gaining 
traction, which they're trying to make this about, is not what in fact the debate is about, 
which is men aren't finished.  And -- 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Right, I was talking about surpassing them, not equaling them, surpassing them. 
 
David Zinczenko: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 -

Yes, and maybe -- look, I can sit here and talk about the ratio of college-educated men 
to women in Birmingham being 13 to 17 and in Oakland 11 to eight, we can talk about 
stats all day long. 
 
20:00:16  
 
But if you come back to the facts, the main facts when it comes to how wealth is 
distributed, the fact that men are still earning more than women, that they're still 
running boards, running countries, inventing new technologies, you are in a situation 
where men aren't finished, and that's why you have to vote against this motion.  
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah, right there with this -- yeah, I'm looking right at you.  And just wait for the mic. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Something for Dave and then one question for the panel, but you mentioned that men 
still hold the majority of resources, 99 percent and they run 92 percent of the countries, 
do you honestly think that's because they're more competent?  I mean, why do you 
think that is?  Do you think it has something to do with deeply rooted structural 
patriarchy that's been enforced through violence over the past 40,000 years, like -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
20:01:18  
 
-- and then one more question for the whole panel -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait on that one because -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
I'm sorry [spelled phonetically]. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- because nobody will remember the two, and that was a pretty good one. 
 
Female Speaker: 
It's a quick one, it's just -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No, hold off, I'll come back to you for the second one and -- but let this one go and then 
-- but I'll come back.  Go ahead, David.

David Zinczenko: 
Yeah, look, I think that men have had an enormous head start.  That's what I'm arguing.  
I am for gender equality.  I am just saying men aren't finished.  You know, and I -- 
 
John Donvan: 
And that's why you have to vote against the motion. 
 
David Zinczenko: 
And that's why you have to vote against the motion. 
 
[laughter] 
 
We have to stay very focused here.  And look, I think one of the things -- so men have 
had a tremendous head start, that's worldwide, the gains they've made, certainly 
women have made enormous gains and will continue to make them, and we should 
support all of them, but it's not what we're debating here tonight.  And it's funny the 
point that Hanna made about Men's Health as a lose your gut type magazine.   
 
20:02:19  
 
Well, let's get back to that for one second, okay?  This right here is the world's leading 
women's magazine, okay, right here. 
 
John Donvan: 
For the radio audience, tell us what you're holding up right now. 
 
David Zinczenko: 
This is “Cosmopolitan,” okay, which just happens to be the world’s leading women’s 
magazine.  I think they’re in like 97 countries or something.  Left side, naughty -- 21 
naughty sex tips, bold breathless moves. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Wait, so why do you want to be like that? 
 
David Zinczenko: 
Shrink your inner thighs in six minutes a day.  Times he wants you to be jealous.  Four 
words that seduce any man any time.  This magazine is concerned -- it seems like 
women are concerned a lot with men, okay.  Then we go over to a magazine like “Men’s 
Health,” -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
--which also happens to be the world’s largest men’s magazine.

David Zinczenko:

Hanna Rosin: 
So why don’t we -- we’ve just proved that men are obsessed with themselves, and 
women are obsessed with men. 
 
Male Speaker: 
I’m sorry, women -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me come back to your second question and make it very short because I’d like to 
move on to -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
[unintelligible] go back, this whole conversation also has been very binary between men 
and women.  And I was curious, for everyone and maybe for Hanna who’s done so much 
on-the-ground reporting, also, where like gender non-conforming people and trans 
people fit into this conversation? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Well, they -- you know, I mean, one thing that we all wish for is for men to accept a 
broader range of self identities.  So in the sense that, you know, it’s much more 
acceptable to be gay now, no, there’s no problem with being gay.  You know, gay people 
can get married, they cannot get married, that maybe holds up a world in which it’s 
okay for a wide range, like it’s okay for a guy to be a stay-at-home dad.   
 
20:04:16  
 
There’s a new sitcom about a guy who’s a stay-at-home dad and maybe you should 
watch it, you know.  Maybe more guys will become stay-at-home dads. So you don’t 
have to feel like super self-conscious if you’re a guy whose wife, for example, makes 
more money than you do, which is a -- which is now almost 30 percent of the

population, which, again, was unheard of only, you know, 20 years ago is now fairly 
common.  And you don’t have to like slink away in shame if that is you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, I need to do another radio break, so I’d just like to ask you to applaud again, and 
I’ll come back and -- 
 
[applause] 
 
So we are in the middle of a question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared 
U.S. debate.  I’m John Donvan, your moderator.  We have four debaters, two teams of 
two.  And they are debating this motion, "Men are finished."  And I want to do one more 
time without the applause to give them that option.   
 
So we’re in the middle of the Q and A section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  
I’m John Donvan of ABC News, your moderator.  We have four debaters, two teams of 
two, debating this motion, "Men are finished."  So let’s go to another question.  Sir, 
you’ve got a white card in your hand. 
 
Jay Searson: 
Thank you.  
 
John Donvan: 
But one thing I want to say.   
 
20:05:22  
 
The two-part questions are driving me nuts and long, long premises are driving me nuts, 
so just write out the question.  Thanks. 
 
Jay Searson: 
It’s very brief. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Jay Searson: 
My name is Jay Searson [spelled phonetically].  I’m one of the few men in that own-
your-own-company, entrepreneurial category, so I’m not finished, I think.  So I’d like to 
point out, Ms. Rosin, your whole point seems to be, you know, you’re arguing that what 
we have now is the beginning of a trend.  So, suppose that just before Tom Edison 
invents the light bulb, all the candlestick makers are Irishmen.  After Edison invents the 
light bulb, all those candlestick-making jobs go away, and things look pretty bad for the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Irish.  But nobody would say that it’s the end of Irishmen.  It’s the end of candlestick 
makers.   
 
20:06:16  
 
And we’ve just had a housing bubble that eliminated a ton of construction jobs.  And 
those construction jobs were overwhelmingly male because men actually had a genetic 
advantage doing construction.  It requires heavy lifting.  
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, okay, okay. 
 
Jay Searson: 
So why is it a trend -- 
 
John Donvan: 
One more sentence from your mouth and have a question mark at the end.  Because 
you’ve got a good point, but focus it. 
 
Jay Searson: 
That’s the question.  Why is it a trend? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
I think I got it.  I got it, I got it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Okay, so in the first recession, that’s what we thought.  We thought, “Oh, it’s just the 
end of construction jobs.”  And then in the second recession, we thought, “Oh, it’s just 
the end of, you know, pipeline fitter jobs,” and then we thought it’s just the end of this 
and the end of that.  And then suddenly we realized, no, it’s actually the end of the 
manufacturing era.  So you realize that this was a trend that was not going to go away or 
reverse itself and that all these jobs that men happened to do were sort of shrinking and 
shrinking and shrinking.  And they were never going to come back.   
 
20:07:14  
 
So, you know, I don’t know -- you want me to say it’s like the end of manufacturing -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let’s hear from your opponents.  Christina? 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Christina Hoff Sommers: 
First of all, I just don’t accept the idea that men, the jobs that men will hold in the future 
are going to be -- they’re going to have to be dance therapists or executive producers.  If 
you look at the projections from the labor department, we're going to need vast -- 
millions and millions of engineers and people that are experts in information 
technology.  And there are still going to have to be people constructing and 
manufacturing.  So it's naive to suggest that we're moving away entirely from jobs that 
were conventionally done by men.  And I just want to go back to one question that was 
raised before about where do transgendered people and gay people fit in.  It was 
actually -- a lot of my positions about men and women came from sympathy that I had 
for transgendered and gay people, people that didn't fit into their gender role, because 
one of the things they tell us is that your gender role is very powerful.  And it's not 
socially constructed.  It's something you are born with.   
 
20:08:14  
 
And what I urge in my writing is to be respectful, yes, of people who defy the 
stereotypes of their gender, but also to be respectful of those of us who embody the 
stereotypes.  There are many people who are -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
[unintelligible] 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
-- conventionally fem -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Yep. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
He wants -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Did you want to -- 
 
David Zinczenko: 
I would just say I completely agree with the point about trends.  They're called trends 
for a reason.  They don't last forever.  That's why we're not all walking around -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
No, they're called trends because they're true. 
 
Dan Abrams:

But it misses the point, which is that the more important point, directly responding to 
your question about the candlesticks, is that what we're seeing in society today, and 
Hanna has studied a lot more than have I, is the idea that the people who are making 
candles and engaging in jobs that are becoming outdated or whatever the case may be, 
women have figured out a way to navigate the tough economy better than men.  And 
they are simply adapting better than are men.  And that's the really important point 
here.  It's not just that the male jobs are being eliminated. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Yes.  Thank you. 
 
Diane Salvatore: 
Yes, hi.  Hello.  Diane Salvatore, editor of Prevention magazine.   
 
20:09:15  
 
Is it true that -- that men with power and money tend to self-destruct more than 
women do?  And I think here of Oprah versus Charlie Sheen. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Or how about anybody versus Charlie Sheen? 
 
David Zinczenko: 
That's why I said before that Dan is probably finished, but not others. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
I'm just thankful to you for mentioning Charlie Sheen because I feel like you just say 
"Charlie Sheen" enough times, and everybody will vote for us. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Sir, I'm looking right at you.  If you stand up -- yep.  Michael, come in, please.  Thank 
you.  That was a question.  That was a focused question.  That's the model. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
By a woman.

Male Speaker: 
All right.  I'm going to try and redeem the men's side with this question.  You spoke 
earlier about bloggers versus loggers.   
 
20:10:15  
 
I guess everybody would agree that technology is the new frontier. And if you look at 
Silicon Valley, it's dominated by young men.  What do you say to that? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Well, whenever I look at these -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Hanna Rosin. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
-- questions, because we always think, oh, men are better at technology.  They're better 
engineers.  I do, in my head what I call the cross-border biology check.  Now, what is a 
cross-border biology check?  I try and think, okay, is this just something we think is true 
because we look at it, and we assume it ever has to be true, while in India, half of 
engineering students are women.  Now, why is that?  Because it's encouraged in India, 
and because that's something everybody has to do.  It's not something that men are 
necessarily better than women at.  So I just feel like eventually that will be true here 
too.  We put an emphasis on it, and women will do it. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Correction about India?  In countries like -- people often say, Look at India, look at 
Malaysia. Women are the engineers, and far more women are becoming physicists.  In 
those countries, women don't have as much choice of what they do.  Because of 
economic pressures, they are forced to do careers in a society where there's more 
prosperity, women have more choice, and they go into other fields.   
 
20:11:20  
 
And that's why if you look at what American women are majoring in it's art history and 
education, all sorts of things.  They're not forced to do something they don't want to do. 
Men do.  That is their number one choice in college majors, or it's -- of all the majors, 
that's the one men choose, I guess, after business.  Whereas women, it's teaching.  So 
there are -- there are differences in that, again, I am insisting that we need both in the 
new economy. 
 
John Donvan: 
Right here, second row.  A mic's going to come for you.  Second -- third stand.  I'm sorry.  
I meant -- sorry.

Male Speaker: 
All right.  I just wanted to clarify some things.  The debate's title is called "Men are 
finished."  And it seems that all four of you agree and disagree on different points on 
how to interpret that. So can you -- can each panelist give some examples on the 
representative man and the representative woman that they think is defining these new 
trends? 
 
John Donvan: 
It's a good question.  It will take a half an hour. 
 
[laughter] 
 
20:12:21  
 
So I'm going to respectfully pass, but not to disrespect the question.  I just think it would 
chew up too much time and maybe not get us to a new place.  So if you could pass to 
your -- see, by being persistent -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yes.  Hello.  My name is David, and I am a student here at NYU.  And I'm male.  But I just 
wanted to ask, because I've seen that a lot of the debate has been going on about what 
is considered traditionally male or traditionally female.  And I was wondering if it was 
really possible to determine whether or not men are, quote, unquote, "finished," based 
on these traditional sort of stereotypical characteristics, because if you look at it, what is 
considered traditionally female is not what they're [unintelligible] right now.  Like the 
female workers in business or economics or whatever tend to have more what we 
consider traditionally male traits. 
 
20:13:18  
 
John Donvan: 
So a man going into nursing you feel would be going into a female profession? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Well, I would say that it's what’s considered traditionally female.  But I think what we 
consider traditionally male or female -- 
 
John Donvan: 
So -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
-- so iss not really whole.  [spelled phonetically] 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 -

John Donvan: 
So if you focus your question down to one sentence, what, what is it? 
 
Male Speaker: 
All right.  Is it -- is it really possible to say that men are finished based on what we 
consider to be traditionally male and female -- considering the fact that in modern times 
the definitions of said genders -- 
 
John Donvan: 
That the world is changing.  I think I see what he's saying. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Can the lady from Prevention magazine reformulate that? 
 
John Donvan: 
Hanna Rosin, do you want to take it? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
-- formulate that? 
 
John Donvan: 
Who would like to take that? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Well, there is some evidence -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Hanna Rosin. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
-- that as women become more dominant, they take on more traits that we think of as 
traditionally masculine.  So I think that a lot of these things are much more fluid than we 
think they are.  That's why I'm always reluctant to enter into this gender biology 
question:  Women are like this, and men are like this.  Women have gotten vastly more 
aggressive.  They are -- they're much, much more likely to get arrested, especially 
juvenile females than they were 20 years ago.   
 
20:14:23  
 
You know, so this is a sort of scale that moves along a continuum. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.

Hanna Rosin: 
Though, as I said -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm guessing you will agree with that.  So, sir -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Well -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No? 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
One thing she's left out.  Okay.  Go on. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, no, no, no.  Christina, if you're serious, go ahead. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Well, it's one thing that does not change in human nature is that men tend to succeed 
and fail more spectacularly than females.  So you find more males who are, in any 
economy, any situation, there are going to be males that are going to find their way to 
the top.  And there will be males that will find their way to the bottom. 
 
John Donvan: 
Right. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Men have that -- that capacity. 
 
John Donvan: 
That was Dan Abrams homerun -- swinging for the fence point.  Sir, you're standing in 
the aisle?  Yes.  You just pointed to yourself.  Yeah, that's -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
No, that's not -- that's me being confused, not him, all right? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Thank you.  This is a point first made by Slate magazine's Emily Bazelon who I think it 
was -- or what I heard is I think it's appropriate to do it here where you're a cosponsor.

But the company Wal-Mart recently faced a lawsuit about systematically discriminating 
against women and whatever you think about the outcome of that.  The point was, 
clearly Wal-Mart wasn't utilizing their -- or empowering their female work force.  And all 
the economic evidence which Wal-Mart would have definitely had at its disposal would 
suggest that that would be the profit maximizing thing to do.  And we all know Wal-Mart 
loves profit.  So I guess my question for the panel is, why is that, and what does that 
mean for our motion? 
 
John Donvan: 
You know, I think it's a little -- I think it's a little bit off point on getting us to the 
question of whether we think men are finished or not, so respectfully, I'm going to pass 
on that. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
But I could just reformulate it. 
 
John Donvan: 
But I -- I -- 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
I would just like to ask, why don't all of our leading companies, if they were really smart, 
fire all their males who are useless and hire females?   
 
20:16:17  
 
Well, they don't -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, they're not saying that they're useless.  They haven't gone that far. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
They're not useless, but they're on their way out. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  So you want to answer that? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Yeah.  I mean, they don't have to fire all of their males, but they certainly have to -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- fire most of them.

Leslie Bennetts: 
The moderator started out by saying that increasing -- Leslie Bennetts, Newsweek Daily 
Beast. The moderator started out by saying that increasingly men are not assuming the 
responsibilities of parenthood.  Both the men on the panel who are middle aged, single 
and childless would be examples of this.  And I'd like to know why they think that this is 
so often the case these days, men are marrying less and less.  Men are not supporting 
their families.  The statistics on the nonpayment of things like child support are 
astronomical.  And that's always been one of the hallmarks of adulthood.   
 
20:17:15  
 
I'd like to know what the panel has to say about that. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
Since I'm being lumped in with dead beat dads, I think I'll probably pass on this one.

Hanna Rosin: 
I'm not touching that.  I have three children.  I just like to brag about that.  I'm not going

David Zinczenko: 
Well, I mean, I -- you know, obviously you're well-read and you've probably read the

biggest contributors to their family and in their community, so --

Sure. 
 
Leslie Bennetts: 
Statistically there's a lot of evidence and I'm really curious about why you guys think 
that men are turning away from -- you know, I mean, a generation or two ago by the 
time men were in their late 20s they often had three or four kids.  That's not the model 
today.  I'm interested in what the men have to say about [inaudible] -- 
 
Dan Abrams: 
But women are also having -- but women are also having children later, I mean, it's not a 
male-female [inaudible]. 
 
Leslie Bennetts: 
Yeah, but a lot of women are having children alone because men don't want to 
participate. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Yeah, no, if we look at -- 
 
20:18:16  
 
Dan Abrams: 
Okay.  Or because -- 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
-- if we look at this from the children's perspective and the children in this sort of 59 
percent that I was talking about, we would definitely win and you would definitely have 
to vote for men are finished.  It's like a shocking phenomenon, 40 percent of American 
children are now born to single parent households.  You could say that's because the 
women have decided that the men are finished, they don't need them, they don't 
contribute to the household, the women are the ones doing all the work and going to 
school and the men are just sort of another child in the house to feed and that's what all 
the women tell me. 
 
[laughter] 
 
I wish that it was funny but it's not funny.  That's the part of this that's the tragedy 
about men are finished.

One last question, sir. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Well, my background is in the apparel industry.  I was the largest employer in the State 
of Tennessee, and the largest employer in the State of Maryland, and the largest 
employer in Alabama, all women sewing apparel.  And we had to train women 
managers, and we made a major effort to do that.  
 
John Donvan: 
So what's your question then? 
 
20:19:16  
 
Male Speaker: 
My education is business school where there was one woman in a class of 800 when I 
went -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Right, but I'd like you to get to a question, sir. 
 
Male Speaker: 
What we need to do is be sure that women are taught how to manage large groups of 
people and then they will get the important jobs, not just do the work, and we haven't 
done that, now how can we make more women managers, not just family managers, 
but managers of businesses, service businesses, and manufacturing businesses, most of 
which in my industry worked overseas? 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, I'm not sure that, that's getting to our question of what do we do for the men, 
which I think is a little bit more on point. 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
There are women managers -- there -- 54 percent of American managers are now 
women, they don't need that much help on that. 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to take one more question, right down in front with [inaudible]. 
 
Female Speaker: 
I just have a quick question.  Does anybody have the statistics on how many men 
become women and how many women become men? 
 
[laughter]

20:20:19  
 
John Donvan: 
It's -- that's a whole ‘nother debate which we're going to have shortly. 
 
[laughter] 
 
All right.  Folks, really, really, I think it has been so clear and all instances about how to 
do this.  Sir, can you stand up?  That's one of the parts -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
My question is, can you imagine being a cofounder or founder of an island where only 
women live on this island? 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, I'm going to go to another -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Yes, I can, but -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
I have an answer. 
 
John Donvan: 
I sometimes do, but -- right down front. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Someone did ask the question, what would it be like if women ran the world and the 
reply was there would be no more war, just lots of jealous countries refusing to speak to 
one another. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, can you rise?  And make this a -- give us a finish here.  Because you might be our 
last question. 
 
20:21:21  
 
Female Speaker: 
Although it's true that women have been earning more bachelor's degrees, how 
significant of a point is that when women are still doing two thirds of the work in the 
world and earning 10 percent of the income and owning less than one percent of the 
property?  And that's directed towards Hanna and Dan.

John Donvan: 
Okay, again, it's not on our topic about men. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Somebody, hear me, hear me.  You got it? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Men are not finished. 
 
John Donvan: 
You got it? 
 
Male Speaker: 
Hello? 
 
John Donvan: 
Front row, sorry, please, don't make me regret choosing you.  
 
[laughter] 
 
Male Speaker:  
I'm a do you proud, I'm a do you proud.  My question is for Christina.  You were 
speaking earlier about how in elementary school it's designed against boys. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Sometimes, yes, very often. 
 
20:22:16  
 
Male Speaker: 
Well, you were emphasizing how dire it was that we have to change that and we have to 
help boys. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
Right. 
 
Male Speaker: 
In doing so, are you conceding that if something doesn't change, then men are finished? 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
Yes. 
 
John Donvan:

Christina, take that question. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
First of all, men -- that's ridiculous, men are not finished.  And that’s why you should 
vote against the proposition. No, but -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
No, what I’m saying is we have set up an obstacle course for young men that makes it -- 
and we’re doing a much better job educating young women, supporting young women, 
encouraging young women.  There is -- every scintilla of evidence suggests it.  So what 
we have to do is find a way and, yes, it goes back to the elementary school classroom 
where we have to support boys.  Now am I saying that means men are finished?  No, I 
don’t see how you hear that.  I’m saying we’ve set up handicaps.  We’ve set up 
obstacles. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yes, and unless we change and get rid of those handicaps, men are finished. 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
No, false.  Wrong, illogical. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
I’ll give you one statistic, patents. 
 
Dan Abrams: 
I’ve got to get my brother to sit down.

And here’s where we are.  We are about to hear closing statements from each debater 
in turn. They will be two minute each.  And remember how you voted before the 
debate.  Right after these closing statements, we’re going to ask you once again to vote.  
And the team that has changed your minds -- most of your minds in the course of this 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 60 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

debate -- I’m going to say that again.  And the team that has most of your minds in the 
course of the debate will be declared our winner.  So, onto round three, closing 
statements.  Our motion is this, "Men are finished." And here to summarize his position 
again, her position -- and here to summarize her position against the motion, Christina 
Hoff Sommers, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of “The 
War Against Boys.” 
 
[applause] 
 
Christina Hoff Sommers: 
I urge you to vote against this proposition for three reasons.   
 
20:24:18  
 
Number one, it’s false.  Okay, women are not replacing men.  Women are not becoming 
the first sex.  Women are becoming partners with men.  Men continue to do most of the 
arduous and dangerous work, and they are the primary risk-takers and innovators.  
Society is driven by what the classical economist Joseph Schumpeter called “the gale of 
creative destruction.”  Women can cause such gales, but it has always been a masculine 
specialty, and there is zero evidence that that is changing.   
 
Now as I said in my earlier remarks, men have been doing less well in the classroom, but 
this does not herald the end of men.  Rather, it means that we have to find ways of 
making our schools more effective for male students.  Reason two you should oppose 
this proposition:  It’s chauvinistic.  As I said, in the old days, we had female supremacy.  
It’s been replaced by this variety of “women are wonderful” phenomenon.   
 
20:25:17  
 
The battle days of male supremacy are now followed by this female chauvinism.  So, I 
believe that an act in favor of this proposition is a vote for chauvinism.  Third and most 
important, the sexes need each other.  They complement each other.  They have been 
known to love one another.  As Henry Kissinger once said, “No one will ever win the war 
between the sexes. There’s just too much fraternizing with the enemy.” 
 
[laughter] 
 
Now women and men do not succeed at one another’s expense.  We’re on the same 
team. We’re co-dependent.  That was true on the African Savanna 100,000 years ago.  It 
has been true ever since.  It’s true in 21st century America.  You can certainly find times 
when one sex has acquitted itself better than the other, but you will never find 
examples of one sex becoming irrelevant.  Such a development is beyond anything in 
human experience.  I urge you to vote in favor of reality.  Thank you.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Christina Hoff Sommers. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "Men are finished," and here to summarize her position in support of this 
motion, Hanna Rosin, an award-winning journalist for Slate and The Atlantic. 
 
[applause] 
 
Hanna Rosin: 
I’m going to start out by reading you a couple of quotes.  One is from a story called, “The 
Decline of the American Male.”  “Men,” this writer says, “are endangered species.  They 
are expendable.”  Another quote: “Women have gained in the past century while men 
have fallen behind.”  Who is this mystery author?  Dave Zinczenko is the mystery author 
who wrote this story at USA Today in 2009.  He keeps saying this is preposterous, this is 
preposterous.  Merely two years ago, he thought that it was true.  Now I’m going to 
read you another series of quotes. “It is boys who are the second sex.  It’s a bad time to 
be a boy in America.  The research” -- listen to this closely -- “commonly cited to support 
claims of male privilege and male sinfulness is riddled with errors.”   
 
20:27:22  
 
Who is the mystery author of this article?  Christina Hoff Sommers, who’s also saying 
that this is all very preposterous.  So, as you can see, it’s not that preposterous.  We can 
all see the writing on the walls.  They keep talking about how men are still running the 
country.  Men are still doing this, men are still doing that.  But that's not interesting.  
That just shows a lack of imagination. As we said, this "Men are finished" proposition, 
you literally have to think of it as graffiti, as the writing on the wall pointing to an 
inevitable future.  All the signs are there.   
 
So -- and then the final thing I want to say is, Christina says this is a vote for chauvinism, 
that "Men are finished" is a vote for chauvinism. Don't think of it that way.  You're 
actually doing a public service to men if you vote for our team because I think if we 
finally acknowledge that this is a problem and that men are finished and that they need 
our help, and they might even need some affirmative action, then maybe we would 
behave the right way, and we would help the men who desperately need our help.  So 
remember, vote for men are finished."

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Hanna Rosin.  Our motion is "Men are finished."  And here to summarize his 
position against the motion, David Zinczenko, executive vice president and editor in 
chief of Men's Health magazine. 
 
[applause] 
 
David Zinczenko: 
Well, thank you.  Thank you, John.  Thank you.  Hats off to Dan and Hanna.  That article, 
by the way, was arguing for better healthcare for men.  There are five offices of 
women's health in the federal government, zero for men.  That was really the context.  
Now, my opponents tonight have outlined some trends that seem to herald the final 
decent of the American male into a metaphorical trash heap of irrelevance and 
impotence.  They are trying to bury legions of men alive, okay?  You have to vote against 
this measure. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Sure, there are some worrisome trends.   
 
20:29:19  
 
They went through them, okay?  And as we all know once a trend starts, it keeps going 
on forever.  That's why all of our houses are worth so much more today than they were 
in 2007. Now, in the end, there are two reasons why you must vote against this motion, 
because they might be wrong, but they might be right.  Now, the first point, consider 
this:  Gender equality is something, we can all agree on, as an ideal.  But if we are 
approaching gender equality, why are there fewer women in government today than 
there were ten years ago?  Why is it so much easier for men to hold onto their gun 
rights than it is for women to hold onto their reproductive rights?  Not only aren't men 
finished, but women haven't even begun. Let's at least get to the point where the game 
is tied before we start writing all the men off.  Let's imagine, though, that the trend 
toward greater female political social and economic power continues unabated.   
 
20:30:20  
 
Highly unlikely because the great recession started with men and now it's starting to hit 
predominantly female jobs more than before.  And the scales are tilting.  So the more 
educated independent single women there are the more wonderful the world will 
actually get for men, okay?  So regardless of whether we one day achieve gender 
equality, men are not finished.  And by the way, women are not either.  You have to 
vote against this measure.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, David Zinczenko. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "Men are finished."  And here to summarize his position in support of the 
motion, Dan Abrams, chief legal analyst for ABC News, author of "Man Down." 
 
Dan Abrams: 
It seemed at times that our opponents were pleading to you as a moral matter to vote 
against this.  It would be wrong, be horrible.  Look what would happen?  You would 
make the guys feel bad.  Look, the reality is that we're not just talking about women 
catching up.   
 
20:31:20  
 
We're talking about women surpassing men.  Both Hanna and I have talked to you in 
depth and at length about how significantly women have not caught up but surpassed 
men in very significant areas in our society.  David mentioned before that you're not 
going to see jock strap protests outside.  That's right.  That's part of the problem is that 
men are not alarmed by the situation. And that's one of the main reasons that men are 
finished, is they don't seem to care. 
 
[laughter] 
 
They think -- they think it's cool to be a slacker.  It's not.  Dave mentioned the Chilean 
mines and the miners there as an effort to sort of pull at your heartstrings.  There's no 
question that that was a heartfelt moment.   
 
20:32:17  
 
But what if a woman had designed that mine?  I'm guessing that we might not have ever 
had that sort of problem. 
 
[laughter] 
 
I will end with one note from my book which is that there was a study done on how long 
it takes men and women to get ready to leave the house.  And this study, in England, of 
2,000 people showed that men take, on average, four minutes longer.  When you think 
about a Saturday night, no question women will take longer to get ready to leave the 
house.  But when you think about the realities that women face every day of bringing up 
children, of working a job very often, of doing all the hard work and trying to get ready 
to leave the house, it starts to make sense.  And if that study's true, then men really are 
finished.

And that concludes our closing statements.  And now it's time to learn which side you 
feel has argued the best.  Remember, we've asked you to vote before the debate began.   
 
20:33:16  
 
We're going to ask you to vote "against" now judging the qualities of these arguments.  
You go to the keypad at your seat.  Our motion is this:  "Men are finished."  If you agree 
with the motion or feel that the argument was presented best on that side, you push 
number one.  If you disagree, you push number two.  If you remain or became 
undecided, you push number three.  
 
Female Speaker: 
[inaudible] 
 
Jon Donvan: 
Yes.  Seriously?  One, if you're for the motion. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Two if you're against.  They're number one.   
 
Hanna Rosin: 
We’re number 1, they’re number 2. 
 
John Donvan: 
That's a very good way to put it.  We've never done that.  And a woman came up with 
that idea. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Number one, number two, undecided is number three.  All right.  We're going to have 
the results very, very quickly.  I want to just talk a little bit about a couple of things that 
are coming up.  But first I want to thank the debaters for the quality of the arguments 
that they brought here.

And for the unique and difficult to achieve combination of being serious and intelligent 
while also a lot of fun at the same time.  This is also normally the point in the evening in 
which I thank the audience for its great questions.  And I -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
I want to say that it really pleased me to see those neurons firing rapidly, and in some 
cases randomly.  But -- but all of you for having the guts to get up and face this and face 
what I was doing.  In any case, I really appreciate it.  And as an audience, you actually 
have been spectacular, wonderful and very vocal.  So thank you very much for this 
evening.

We'd like to thank Slate for being our media partner for live streaming this debate and 
for bringing questions to us and for being part of this in the future as well.

So -- we're back here again on Tuesday, October 4th.  Our next debate has this motion:  
"Grandma's Benefits Imperil Junior's Future."   
 
20:35:17  
 
Arguing in support of this motion, we'll have Margaret Hoover.  She is author of 
"American Individualism."  It's a political manifesto that evokes her great-grandfather, 
Herbert Hoover's, emphasis on the values of civic responsibility.  Joining her as her 
teammate is Mort Zuckerman, chairman and editor in chief of U.S. News and World 
Report who wondered, in a recent op ed, how, quote, "a country of pioneers and self-
made men could evolve into a culture of entitlement."  Arguing against this motion, 
we're going to have Howard Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee, six-term governor of Vermont, a physician and one-time candidate for 
president in 2004.  And his partner will be Jeff Madrick editor of Challenge magazine and 
author of "The Case for Big Government."   
 
And that argues -- that says that engaged government, a big government of high taxes 
and wise regulations is necessary to ensure America's social and economic security.  You 
can find a full listing of all of our fall debates in tonight's program and also on our

Okay.  I'm going to announce the results.  And I want to do it this way.  So these 
debaters have spent the last hour plus trying to win you over to their point of view on 
our motion, "Men are finished."  We had you vote once before the debate and once 
again at the end of the debate. Both of those votes are now in.  And here are the results.  
Before the debate, with the motion being, "Men are finished," 20 percent were for the 
motion, 54 percent were against, and 26 percent undecided.  After the debate, 66 
percent are for the motion.   
 
20:37:16  
 
That's up 46 percent.  29 percent are against.  That is down 25 percent.  5 percent 
undecided. That's down 21 percent.  The side arguing for the motion, "Men are 
finished," has carried our debate.  Our congratulations to them.  Thank you from me,
