JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, Ladies and gentlemen, we’re going to begin in about one 

minute.  If you could take your seats quickly... [PAUSE]  Thanks. 

All right, let’s begin.  I’d like to begin the evening first by 

introducing the Chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S., Mr. 

Robert Rosenkranz.  [APPLAUSE]   

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Well thank you all very much.  I see a lot of new faces.  And I 

think the buzz at the cocktail hour was about as buzzy as we’ve 

ever seen.  So thank you all for being here and braving the 

weather.  The language of tonight’s resolution, I think I might 

have done it a little differently had I known about the Bernie 

Madoff scandal. [LAUGHTER]  But the art world does have its

share of forgeries and its share of dealers who fake provenances 

and its instances where things are stolen from consignors.  So 

there are bad apples in every basket.  But that’s not really the 

thing that interests us and why we picked the language of this 

debate.   

 

It’s really the ethical issues revolving around two ideas.  And one 

idea is secrecy and the other idea is manipulation.  When you 

buy a work of art at auction it seems like a very open process.  

But there are a lot of secrets.  You don’t know what the reserve 

is.  You don’t necessarily know the source or the meaning of the 

estimates that are attached.  There’s no real disclosure about 

guarantees.  If the auction house has made a deal with favored 

third parties, you don’t know about that.  What’s described as a 

buyer’s premium is sometimes rebated to the seller or used for 

other purposes.  Again, pretty obscure, a lot of secrets in that 

process.  And the second element, I’d say, is market 

manipulation.  As an example, the graphic symbol we used for 

tonight’s debate was Damien Hirst’s skull encrusted in 

diamonds.   

 

That was widely publicized to have sold for a hundred million 

dollars, which I believe is the highest price ever paid for a work 

by a living artist.  Well, it turned out subsequently that the 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

purchaser was none other than Damien Hirst and his dealer to 

the tune of at least fifty per cent of the syndicate that was buying 

it – and who knows how much in reality.  In the recent auction of 

Damien Hirst’s work he or his dealer was a buyer of a lot of key 

lots.  And another example is the Warhol market, which is 

dominated by a family called Mugrabi – textile merchants from 

Columbia, who own eight hundred Warhols and are prominent 

buyers of all of the prime examples that they bid up at auction.  

So it’s also very common practice for dealers to bid up the 

auction prices of works of art by artists in their stables.  But 

dealers get very angry at clients who sell at auctions – often 

blacklisting those clients.   

 

So I’d like now to turn back to the stock market.  In the 1920s 

there were syndicates of sophisticated investors who would 

quietly accumulate stock and would then sell the stock back and 

forth to each other at ever increasing prices in order to give the 

unsuspecting public the sense that there was an ebullient and 

lively market.  When the public came in the insiders would 

quietly sell.  Well, that conduct became illegal and it’s been illegal 

for the last sixty or seventy years.  And in a way, when the art 

market is advertising prices at auction that are not real, that are 

intended really to deceive people about the true state of the 

market, that’s a very similar kind of manipulation.  The questions 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 4. 

 

 

 

for tonight are, How endemic is that?  How common is it?  Should 

those kind of practices be illegal?  And finally, does the art 

market operate in a generalized sense with high ethical standards 

or not?  And we have a very, very distinguished panel.  And it’s 

now my pleasure to turn the evening back to John Donvan.    

JOHN DONVAN   

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  And may I invite one more round of 

applause for Robert Rosenkranz, who makes these evenings 

possible?  [APPLAUSE]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to 

another Intelligence Squared U.S. debate from the Caspary 

Auditorium at the Rockefeller University.  I’m John Donvan, your 

host and moderator.  And the motion before us tonight is this:  

The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market.  We have 

six panelists, all from the New York and London art world.  We 

know that we have many members of the New York and London 

art world in the audience tonight as well, which makes for an 

even more interesting evening because this debate actually is a 

contest.   

 

It is a contest of wit and logic and ideas and facts and argument, 

and most of all, persuasion.  The six panelists are here to 

persuade to their point of view on our motion, which I will state 

once again:  The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock 

Market.  In the course of the evening you will hear from the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 5. 

 

 

 

panelists in three rounds.  In the opening round each side will 

speak alternately for seven minutes apiece.  There will be no 

interruptions.  They have clocks that tell them when their time is 

up.  If they exceed that time I will step in and pull reins on them.  

After that we will have about a forty minute section where the 

debaters actually will debate head to head.   And that will be 

mixed up somewhat with questions from me and also questions 

from you, the audience.  And as I asked you earlier, when you 

ask questions please really think in terms of crafting a question.  

It is a challenge, it is an artistic challenge. 

 

And the signature to a question is a question mark at the end of 

the statement.  [LAUGHTER]  And finally, each of the panelists at 

the end of the evening will be able to sum up for two minutes and 

at that point we will find out who the winner is.  Now, what we’re 

gonna ask you to do, we’re going to poll you twice during this 

evening – once now as you come in off the street to see where you 

stand on the motion, and once again at the end of the evening so 

that we can see how many minds were changed.  So if you turn 

now to the keypads that are at your seats – and I explained this 

earlier, but for the new arrivals, there are a series of buttons.  

Please pay attention only to buttons number one, two and three.  

Those are the ones you need to register your opinion on this 

motion.  The motion again:  The Art Market is Less Ethical Than 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

the Stock Market.  Push number one if you agree, number two if 

you disagree and number three if you remain undecided.   

 

If you think that you’ve pushed the wrong button just correct 

yourself and our system will record only your last entry.  And I’ll 

give you about another fifteen seconds to record that.  [PAUSE]  

Does anyone need more time?  [PAUSE]  Okay, we’re locking that 

down.  And in a little while I’ll be reporting those early results 

and then that’ll tell us what the stakes are this evening.  So let’s 

let the debate again.  Our topic is:  The Art Market is Less Ethical 

Than the Stock Market.  Arguing first for the motion is Richard 

Feigen, President and Founder of Richard L. Feigen and 

Company, art dealers.  He opened his first gallery in New York 

City in 1963, which in a sense gives him more experience in the 

art world than perhaps anyone else in this room – time enough to 

know what he likes and also to decide what he does not like, 

particularly before us tonight in the category of ethical behavior 

in the art market.  Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Feigen.  

[APPLAUSE]    

RICHARD FEIGEN  

Thank you very much and thanks to everybody for having this 

forum.  It’s very interesting.  And thanks to all of you for coming.  

The first premise that I want to propose is that the art market is 

a financial market now.   It has become this and it is a totally 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 7. 

 

 

 

unregulated financial market.  I will also try to define ethical.  I 

define ethical as a protection for the investor or art collector and 

unethical as efforts to deceive. I will narrowly define the stock 

market as publicly traded equities.  Otherwise I risk sailing off 

into Bernie Madoff-land and uncharted waters.   The art market 

really is divided into two parts – the private art market, meaning 

the galleries, and the public market, the auction houses.   

 

In the private market there are protections of the purchaser in 

the form of the uniform commercial code in New York and the 

self-policing bodies like the Art Dealers Association of America.  

So I’m gonna foc...--  These are not totally protective but they 

serve a purpose.  I’m gonna focus then on the auction market.  

The press usually defines the art market as the auction market 

for contemporary art, which gets all the press – where prices have 

ballooned in recent years.  And therefore it has become press-

worthy, because big prices make for press.  In the past few years 

there has been rampant speculation.  Until the middle-Nineties a 

work that appeared at auction, if it reappeared within five years it 

would be virtually unsellable.   And now works appear almost 

immediately after being purchased or at least they did until the 

recent unpleasantness in the contemporary market, starting in 

November.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 8. 

 

 

 

 

And because there’s a new wave of speculators at each auction.  

This all really began in the middle-Eighties, when art became 

monetized by the press and the financial institutions into a 

financial market, Sotheby’s launched a financial services arm, 

Citibank an art advisory department and so on.  Banks lent 

money on art and auction houses lent money to buy art.  

Sotheby’s Chairman went to jail for colluding with Christie’s on 

auction commissions.  Now art had become a serious financial 

asset.  Whereas before the Eighties the market was tiny, it now 

became global.  Thousands of people became involved.  Billions of 

dollars changed hands.  But except for foreign governments 

claiming repatriation of antiquities and Holocaust restitutions 

and despite the sums of money involved and vast numbers of 

participants, government seems to treat art as frivolous, as a 

luxury market with no regulation or oversight.   

 

As just one example:  in the Bush Administration tax code, when 

the capital gains tax was reduced from twenty-eight per cent to 

fifteen per cent art remained at twenty-eight per cent – 

apparently because it was treated by the government as a luxury, 

not an asset class.  The stock markets are highly regulated by 

law.  There are also protections for individuals who trade in the 

market through fiduciary, mutual funds and so on.  Regulation

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 9. 

 

 

 

came about as a protection for individual investors.  The art 

market, on the other hand, is totally unregulated.  Things occur, 

particularly in the auction market, that are deliberately contrived 

to deceive the unsophisticated individual and that would be 

subject to criminal penalties in the stock market.  The most 

universally encountered is chandelier bidding, which means fake 

bids to entice bidders into competition.   

 

Whereas regulations exist in the stock market to provide 

transparency, chandelier bidding is specifically designed to 

deceive, to imply that there is competition when there isn’t any.  

Novice buyers usually enter the market through auctions 

because they have no other way to establish values.  And unlike 

securities, there are no two works of art that are identical or are 

in the same condition or have the same credentials.  The only 

source of price comparison is auction data bases.  But, again, 

comparisons are flawed.  The novice auction bidder believes his 

only exposure is his incremental bid.  He assumes that the 

under-bid represents a willing and able competitor.  But if there 

wasn’t any under-bidder?  What if the bid was a phantom, a 

chandelier bid?   

 

When some years ago the issue of chandelier bidding was raised 

in New York’s Consumer Affairs Department, the auctioneers 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 10. 

 

 

 

cried that to eliminate it would take the drama out of auctions 

and they threatened to quit New York City.   When I was quoted 

as saying that when I want drama I go to Broadway [LAUGHTER]   

I was called a horse’s butt.  [LAUGHTER]  The only – I changed 

that word because my wife wouldn’t let me, or somebody in my 

office wouldn’t let me use it.  [LAUGHTER]  The only result of this 

city inquiry was that the auctioneers were forced to identify items 

in which they have a financial interest or that are guaranteed or 

most recently in which there are irrevocable bids identified by 

miniscule symbols virtually invisible or incomprehensible to all 

but professionals.  Otherwise, the auctioneers prevailed with 

their deceptive practices.  In addition, the auction catalog 

disclaimers make it basically caveat emptor, as far as 

authenticity and condition are concerned.   

 

In the private gallery market the invoice establishes the 

guarantee, by law.  The real reason for the auctioneer’s ethical 

ambivalence is the dramatic shift in role over the last forty years 

from agent for the buyer.  Then as demand started exceeding 

supply, first as agent for both buyers and sellers and then 

primarily for the sellers, the buyer paying almost all of the 

commission guarantees and irrevocable bids followed swiftly as 

further enticements to sellers.  But the auctioneer’s role 

remained ambiguous.  The auctioneer was now wearing at least

two invisible hats and when he had an equity in the object, three.    

JOHN DONVAN   

Richard, I have to interrupt you.  Your time is up.  Ladies and 

gentlemen, Richard Feigen.  [APPLAUSE]  Our next debater has 

arguably already earned his place in art history.  Chuck Close’s 

paintings are in the collections of the National Gallery of Art in 

Washington, the Tate in London, the Museum of Modern Art here 

in New York.  And while he has been known to spend months, 

even more than a year, on a single painting tonight we are giving 

him minutes to argue against the motion, that:  The Art Market is 

Less Ethical Than the Stock Market.  [PAUSE]  

CHUCK CLOSE 

Well, it doesn’t seem like we have to do much, given what’s 

happened recently.  But, [LAUGHTER] my argument is a little 

different.  I don’t think that the value of art is determined by 

money at all.  And I – [APPLAUSE]  I don’t think that the value of 

art is measured in that way.  If you look at the turn of the 

century, Bugaro [PH]  sold for far more than any other artist, in 

what would be in today’s terms, millions of dollars.  And the 

artists that we now know and love, the Impressionists, Post-

Impressionists, couldn’t sell their work at all.    

 

So I question whether sales really is a barometer of value and 

whether ethics has anything to do with how that work is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 12. 

 

 

 

marketed.  We have examples of the work being marketed 

extremely well, with great ethics.  And we have examples of it 

being done in a somewhat sleazier fashion.  I would say that art 

is not a business.  Certainly the making of art is not a business.  

My good friend Joe Zucker, who is a great painter, his father was 

a junk dealer, a scrap metal dealer in Chicago.  When he looked 

at Joe’s studio and saw the racks full of unsold paintings, he 

said, You can’t afford to make any more paintings until you get 

rid of some of your inventory.  If any of us made work for that 

kind of reason, you know, you wonder where we would be.  I 

remember Lee Marvin in The Ship of Fools was a washed-up 

baseball player.   

 

And he’s standing at a bar, talking to an artist.  And, because he 

isn’t being paid, he doesn’t play baseball anymore.  And the artist 

is trying to explain to him why he has to have an occupation to 

support his profession.  And that’s really where the art world is 

at.  Most people, most artists make this work whether anybody 

wants it all, makes it year in and year out with little visibility, no 

critical attention and little financial support.  Most artists, by 

nature, are mediocre.  There are no undiscovered geniuses.  Take 

my word.  There are no undiscovered geniuses.  There are many 

undiscovered competent artists, just as competent as the artists 

who are famous and we all know.  There are no charlatans.  If 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 13. 

 

 

 

somebody wanted to be a charlatan the last thing they would do 

is go into art.  There are many other ways.  And I think the 

financial market is obviously a much better place to be a 

charlatan than being an artist.   

 

If you’re lucky enough to find a dealer, the artist and the dealer 

relationship is the heart and soul of the art world.  It is a 

marriage.  Like many marriages, some don’t last forever and 

there may even be some cheating from time to time.  But it is a 

marriage because this is where the rubber meets the road when 

it comes to art and how it is offered to the public.  There are ups 

and downs.  Things are in fashion or out, hot or not.  And if you 

don’t understand the cyclical nature of the art world you’re in for 

a lot of pain.  Dave Hickey said in a really wonderful article in, in 

Art in America this month:  At one time a consensus of 

professional respect would carry an artist through times of no 

money better than money would carry an artist through times of 

no professional respect.   

 

A few museum shows and a nice catalog essay during a lull 

meant that your prices would still be there when fashion changed 

and the money came back.  He went on to say that works of art 

have no intrinsic value.  All their value is extrinsic.  It is invested 

from without and over a period of time.  Damien Hirst’s jewel

encrusted skull has hundreds of thousands of dollars – or it 

might be millions, I don’t know – of diamonds in it.  It did not 

make that piece any more valuable than any other work of his, 

just because it had inherent value.  I’ve got two minutes.  Jesus 

Christ.  [LAUGHTER]  So who are the deciders?  Some are forces 

for good.  I’m borrowing a phrase from Bush on purpose.  Who 

are the deciders?  [LAUGHTER]  Some of those deciders are 

forces for good and some are forces for evil.  I'm not even gonna 

get into it.  Oy.  [PAUSE]  I’ll do this in my closing remarks.  

[LAUGHTER]  I --   

JOHN DONVAN   

[OVERLAP]  Do you want to yield the rest of your time to the 

evening?    

CHUCK CLOSE  

[OVERLAP]  Well, I’ve got two minutes.  No, one more minute. No, 

I --   

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  No, take it.    

CHUCK CLOSE  

I would just repeat that the most important thing is the value 

that art-- art is a meritocracy.  It is a meritocracy because the 

final arbiters of what is important are other artists.  All the hype, 

all the spin, all the effort to construct a career out of thin air, all 

the efforts to manipulate the market notwithstanding, over the

long haul if you don’t have the respect of other artists it will 

disappear and it will not stand the test of time.  So if we’re 

looking at short term investment, perhaps it can be manipulated 

and perhaps it’s not always the most perfectly run organiza--

opportunity.  But over the long haul it’s left up to other artists.  

And I think that’s what finally determines the value in art.  

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Chuck Close.  Our next debater, Michael Hue-

Williams, is founder of the Albion Gallery, located in London and 

New York.  And as we are debating here, London is snowed in.  

Both runways at Heathrow are shut down and somehow Michael 

managed to get what might have been the last plane out.  He 

stepped off of it about three hours ago.  So he obviously wanted 

to argue tonight.  [APPLAUSE]  Ladies and gentlemen, Michael 

Hue-Williams.   

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

Thank you.  I’m going to make some points to support what 

Richard’s already begun on our behalf.  And these will be made 

more in the way that a drunk might use a lamppost --  in support 

rather than illumination.   [LAUGHTER]  however, an early 

statement from 1932, pre-regulation of the stock market, which 

FDR managed, importantly, to begin over here, began with the 

remarks that it was needed because of shocking disclosures of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 16. 

 

 

 

low standards in high places.  This possibly is something that 

could be applied to the art market, I fear.  The stock market in 

London has a dictum.  The dictum is:  Meum dictum pactum.  

This means, My word is my bond.  And it is one of the important 

maxims in the art world, but unfortunately, it is not one that 

necessarily is worth banking upon.  I’m gonna illustrate three 

reasons why the motion:  The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the 

Stock Market, for me, holds water.  The first is that there is no 

real regulation.  The second, that there is no transparency in the 

market, and the third, that there are absolutely no barriers to 

entry.  The first, no real regulation – let me explain by telling you 

a story against myself.  In 1989 and 1990 – it’s a long time ago – I 

was in short trousers.  I had a gallery in London already.   

 

I came to New York on the day of one of the big auctions.  And I 

made a deal with an art dealer here in New York – somebody who 

is extremely prominent to this day – to buy eight paintings by the 

German painter, George Baselitz – an artist who I still greatly 

admire.  And I agreed to buy these for 2.4 million dollars, which 

at the time seemed an extraordinary amount of money to me.  I 

think I was twenty-four years old at the time.  And I left the 

gallery of this man I’d made the deal with.  And I waited because 

there was one similar painting that night in auction in New York.  

And the painting made eight hundred thousand dollars.  I went 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 17. 

 

 

 

to bed that night feeling very clever.  The next morning I got a 

telephone call from the dealer, who told me that the deal did not 

stand and that he was gonna walk away from it.   

 

And of course I was outraged.  But under the UCC regulations, 

anything that is not written on paper and is a transaction above 

five hundred dollars is not enforceable.  Clearly here, ethics and 

the law were not working hand in hand.  Ethically, I felt he was 

doing something that was appalling.  Legally, he was absolutely 

right, he could do it.   That illustrates my first point, that there is 

no real regulation.  The second point that there is no 

transparency in the market has been touched upon by Richard, 

in his remarks about the auction houses and the creation of 

rings.   Rings are… relatively simple to create, it needs a group of 

people who stand outside the framework of the auction houses, 

and they decide to promote an artist, it’s very easily done with a 

young artist, and I can think of one at the moment in the Middle 

East who is an interesting young painter whose work has 

rocketed in price, from tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds 

of thousands of dollars, in the space of less than two years.  A 

group of people bought a lot of pictures, they each owned 

individually, group of pictures, and they started to put these 

pictures into auction, they then go to the auctions, they get 

groups of people bid them up, and thereby they feather their own 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 18. 

 

 

 

nests.    

 

And…this draws attention of the press, the press attention to the 

artist, and it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy that this artist starts to go 

up in value, and by a process of osmosis, the ring benefit from 

the auction house activity that they’ve begun.  This is not 

transparent to the outside viewer, but to art world professionals, 

it is quite obvious when this is happening.  The last point, and 

possibly the most important point, is that, unlike the stock 

market…there are no barriers to entry.   To become an art dealer, 

you need to have a pulse.  [LAUGHTER]  You need to be able to 

count… and probably you need two eyes in your head.  But 

beyond that anybody can be and call themselves an art dealer.   

There was an extraordinary scenario that took place here, 

predominantly here in New York, with an art dealer, so-called, 

called Michael Cohen, some of you may know about this but I’m 

going to use him as an example of an extraordinary situation, 

where he began to trade in commodities, and in the stock market, 

and ran into a lot of financial trouble.    

 

This was not his business, this was what he was making money 

doing on the side.  But he realized that he could solve his 

problems, where there was an absolute call on his money at 30 

days, and he had to deliver, by using other people’s paintings as

collateral.   Some of them, he parked even in the auction houses, 

his level of chutzpah has to be seen to be believed, he actually 

managed to sell a Titian that was on the wall of the Met.  

[LAUGHTER]  In any case, this gentleman eventually did become 

unseated.   And he has disappeared, last sighted in Brazil.  And if 

anybody can help us out with his whereabouts, Jerry Saltz, our 

resident investigative journalist would love to write a story all 

about it.  [LAUGHTER]    

 

I use him as an example, there are very clear demands placed 

upon people, who go into the stock market, the stock market is 

regulated, these individuals are fingerprinted, they are members 

of a licensed body of people who are allowed to trade.   Their 

backgrounds are heavily investigated before they begin.  This is 

not the case with the art world.  And for these three reasons, 

there is no regulation, no transparency, and no barriers to entry.  

These are the reasons that I believe absolutely, that the motion, 

the art market is less ethical than the stock market, cannot be 

disputed.

Thank you, Michael Hue-Williams.  Amy Cappellazzo is deputy 

chairman and international co-head of post-war and 

contemporary art at Christie’s, and she became famous for a

quote, something she said a year or two back when describing a 

rather frothy art market.   She said, “After you have a fourth 

home and a Gulfstream jet, what is there.”  It has been picked up 

and repeated, and repeated and repeated and our next debater is 

Amy Cappellazzo.   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO 

Thank you, John.  [APPLAUSE]  Well, this is such a juicy topic, I 

really don’t even know where to begin, my notes feel, you know, 

my head is flooding with all sorts of other ideas besides these,  

that I’ve put before myself on these pieces of paper today.   

Certainly I’d like to just say that when you’re on a panel it’s 

much more interesting to sit on one than sit through one, so I 

will, you know, work very hard to play to type and make it lively 

and interesting and there’ve been many swipes against auction 

house people tonight and as I am the auction house person on 

this panel, I will get to sort of support and defend the position 

and place of the auction house as sort an ethical player, but…   

In reading the proposition over and over again, “The art market is 

less ethical than the stock market,” of course I had to read this 

multiple times and I had to analyze every word.    

 

Certainly colonizing the word “ethical” will help make you the 

winner tonight.  And, something ethical is described as “proper 

conduct and good living.”  An essential aspect of ethics is the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 21. 

 

 

 

concept of the life worth living, that each of us aspires to this 

quality of life and aspires to have the kind of life that allows us to 

sleep at night and lead an ethical, good life that makes it all 

worth living.   A few things basically need to be established here.  

Art is not a pure commodity, it’s not an ordinary commodity.  

While it certainly is bought and sold and traded, the motivations 

for the place of art in our society, the motivations for its existence 

and everyone who plays within the game of the art world, are 

incredibly conflicting in fact.    

 

So…my premise depends on the concept that the art market does 

not exist without the art world.  That in fact the art world adds 

hugely to the conscience of the art market.  What do I mean by 

the art world, I mean the entire museum profession, critics, 

curators, conservators, other sorts of people in the cultural 

production business, writers, graphic designers who work with 

artists, etcetera.  Art is valuable emotionally, intellectually, 

historically, in a way that other commodities are not inherently.  

The motivations for becoming part of the art world are too 

multiple and varied, the rewards are too varied among the 

various groups, an artist becomes part of the art world for a 

completely different set of reasons, than a dealer does, than a 

critic does.   So while there is—in the art world there are too 

many different rewards, the reward structure is fractured and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 22. 

 

 

 

varied.  Whereas in the stock market, presumably there is a 

singular reward which is financial compensation.    

 

Within that, there is not really an ability for ethical behavior to—

it’s hard to get into ethical run-ins because everybody has a 

completely different system of reward and a completely different 

reason for existing within that.   Part of what I put forth here is 

that art is a bit like physics, it can exist both as wave and as 

particle, so it is at once something that is bought, sold, traded as 

a commodity, or as something like a commodity, and it exists in 

this sort of higher place, of emotional, intellectual, historical, and 

cultural meaning and cultural relevance.   I believe that there’s 

something that exists in the art world, that exists in the art 

market, that makes it completely different from the stock market, 

and that is something that I would call, pressure of a common 

pool, which is a sort of basic, Economics 101 theory, an idea that 

things that are precious in the public domain that no one exactly 

owns, let’s say like aquifers, groundwater, forests, fisheries, 

things of this kind, are in fact, there’s a kind of rule of conduct 

about how people engage within them which is essentially… more 

or less ethical.  People who do not behave well within these 

common public treasures are in fact outliers or criminals and are 

really quickly rooted out, and that those of us who participate in 

this pressure of a common pool participate ethically and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 23. 

 

 

 

carefully.   I believe works of art are something that give us 

tremendous pleasure.  They really, you know, all the beautiful 

platitudes about feeding our soul and carrying us through 

difficult times, all of this is entirely true, particularly now, and 

that we all treat works of art in the same coveted fashion with 

care, respect, and preciousness that works of art deserve.    

 

If you break these rules of engagement you are a criminal or an 

outlier.  People who know art, people who collect it, artists who 

make it, collectors who very much covet it, really know that they 

are only temporary custodians of works of art, it’s kind of like 

being a foster parent, you don’t really own these works of art, you 

just take care of them for a while because they’re supposed to 

outlive you.   And you’re supposed to pass them on to someone 

else.  So as long as that is the ethos that surrounds a work of art, 

how this object is understood in the world and in the 

marketplace will always be different than something that trades 

as pure commodity.   So, with the position that the art market is 

less ethical than the stock market, the art world is by far more 

ethical than the stock market.  It has a conflicting set of—has a 

very varied and various, numerous reward system among its 

various participants, as opposed to the singularity of money that 

comes from the stock market.   And the actual object traded is 

very different than a share of stock in all of its principles,

properties, ideas, and values.  And that is why I am arguing 

against this proposition tonight.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Amy Cappellazzo.  So I just want to remind you 

where we are in the evening, we are now at this point halfway 

through our opening round.  I’m John Donvan, your host and 

moderator, and this is Intelligence Squared US, Oxford-style 

debating on America’s shores.   We have six panelists, three who 

are arguing for and three against this proposition, “The art 

market is less ethical than the stock market.”  And now we are 

going to move on, our next panelist will be arguing for the 

motion, “The art market is less ethical than the stock market.”   

Adam Lindemann is one of the world’s leading collectors of 

contemporary art, he likes to share what he knows, he’s written 

essentially a buyer’s guide for collectors, and he also likes to buy 

what he likes.  He calls himself a consumptaholic.  Ladies and 

gentlemen, Adam Lindemann.   

[APPLAUSE]   

ADAM LINDEMANN 

Thanks so much.  I just wanted to remind you all that March 17th 

is “Blame Washington more than Wall Street.”  I do blame 

Washington.  April 21, “It’s wrong to pay for sex,” I do think it’s 

wrong to pay for sex.  Unless you get a good deal.  [LAUGHTER]   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 25. 

 

 

 

And May 12th, “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere” and it is, 

so, that gives you a hint of where I stand here, I’m here to 

basically argue the point that the art market is less ethical than 

the stock market, which it is.    

 

I want to start off by reminding you all what “ethical” actually 

means, ‘cause I wasn’t even sure what it meant when I thought 

about it.  “Ethical” means “being in accordance with the rules or 

standards for right conduct,” ethics means this is correct and 

right conduct and practice.   The standards of a profession, and 

this is the standards of the profession of the art dealer we’re 

talking about.  An example here is, it was not considered ethical 

for physicians to advertise.  It is not ethical for physicians to 

advertise, I thought well why can’t physicians advertise if they’re 

good.   And the reason is physicians are there to help people.  

Physicians are supposed to help you with your health.  And 

therefore it’s not really a business.  Just like the art market is not 

really a business but then how can it be a market and not be a 

business?   We get into this whole…ethical question, about art 

and the market, these two things are really at loggerheads in a 

way.  And I thought, do art dealers advertise.  Because it would 

not be appropriate for physicians to advertise.  Do art dealers 

advertise, and I thought, every art dealer I know, advertised 

heavily.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 26. 

 

 

 

 

As a matter of fact, auction houses advertise, everyone 

advertises, and therefore, it immediately made me feel well 

perhaps, advertising is a sign that this is a business and not 

simply about…ethics and proper conduct.   Now, in terms of the 

stock market, the SEC regulates public companies.  And the 

reason for that, is really to protect the public.  If it weren’t for 

protecting the public, in fact the government would let everyone 

do whatever they wanted to do with public companies, private 

companies and whatnot.   We have many, many rules and 

regulations for the financial markets and of course more rules to 

break, is what many people will think, or more rules to skirt.  But 

the reality is that those rules are there.  Now on the other hand, 

we have works of art, which are inherently unique.    

 

Each work of art is quite different.  Even if there is a Degas which 

sold today for $19 million, that Degas is one of I believe 20 that 

he made and that particular Degas was cast after his death, 

that’s what we call a posthumous cast, so, in my view that Degas 

is quite different from a cast that Degas made during his lifetime.   

How could we regulate Degas’s Danseuse, even if two were 

exactly the same.  The skirt is going to be slightly different, the 

patina was slightly different.  One of them got dropped on the 

floor and restored, the other one didn’t.   So therefore, since art is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 27. 

 

 

 

inherently, each work of art is inherently unique, it’s extremely 

difficult to regulate.  So I was trying to imagine how we would 

regulate the art world in order to make it truly ethical.  And I was 

thinking we would have to create something called the AEC, as 

opposed to the SEC we would have the AEC which is the Art 

Exchange Commission.    

 

This would be a counterpart to the SEC, perhaps a subdivision, 

in which case we could go after Madoff and we could also go after 

art dealers who have sold things that are not correct.  I think that  

that whole idea of regulating the art world is in and of itself 

impossible.   And so then I thought, well, what are these 

standards for proper conduct.  How can we be proper, how can 

we be ethical, in the art market.  And I quickly thought of six fast 

reasons which make it difficult to ensure that every trade in the 

art market will be ethical.   The…of course, many of the dealers 

and many of the people at the auction houses and many of the 

artists are my dear friends, and I don’t mean to say that any of 

them are unethical.  My point is rather that the art market itself 

is ripe for unethical behavior.    

 

That doesn’t mean that the participants in it are unethical.  My 

personal feeling is that the people in the art world that I know are 

the most wonderful and ethical people I know in any 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 28. 

 

 

 

environment, in any business.  But that being said, the entire 

market is ripe for anything to happen.   For example.  Stocks, 

when stocks trade, you pay a commission.  You can pay between 

one and 15 cents, you like the guy, you pay 15 cents, he’s given 

you good information, you can pay 50 cents, you can give him a 

dollar.  You can trade with Charles Schwab.  You—it’s a penny a 

share.   When you’re buying a work of art, you have no idea what 

that real commission is.  The art market is all fair game, it’s 

caveat emptor.  Unless you’re going in with a dealer that you 

know, or a work of art that you know or you have a consultant 

who you trust, you have no idea what the commission is.    

 

You don’t know if it’s 10 percent, 15 percent, yes, common 

practice is 10 percent.  Common practice in the art world, 10 

percent commission.  My question to you is, 10 percent of what.  

The next point which I think is pretty much going to blow this up, 

is the insider trading.   Now, you know that insider trading is 

wrong when you’re trading public securities.  Matter of fact 

insider training is wrong when you’re trading bonds, when you’re 

trading stocks.  Now, you know, it’s illegal on Wall Street and the 

reality is in the art market, we live on inside information.   I mean 

the whole art market is based on inside information, I mean 

that’s the whole idea of art.  You know, there are the insiders and 

then there are the outsiders.  Yes, there’s the concept that art is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 29. 

 

 

 

for everyone and art will transcend, and we all want that feeling, I 

mean, certainly we want the art that’s going to speak to everyone.    

 

However, the reality is, when you’re actually buying art, when 

you’re a collector, when you’re reaching into your pocket and you 

need to spend money, you want to know everything, at least I do.  

It’s not only about love, of course I love, but, I can’t buy 

everything in the world.   So I need to choose what I’m gonna do 

with my resources and I wanna have all that information, 

especially the inside information that I know that dealer has.  

Another type of inside information would be if a young artist is 

going to a big gallery.   This is a critical thing to know.  The other 

thing is opportunities for currency exchanges.  Geographic.  A 

painting in one country is worth less than a painting in another 

country.  Does that make dealers unethical?  Absolutely not.  But 

the whole system is ripe for anything to happen, and that’s the 

beauty of art, and the art market.   

[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Adam Lindemann.  Well, we felt we needed an art 

critic in the debate tonight, and we are fortunate to have Jerry 

Saltz who in ArtReview’s 2008 “Power 100” list was ranked 

number 79…  [LAUGHTER]  And his wife, Roberta Smith of the 

New York Times, the art critic, was ranked number 71.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 30. 

 

 

 

[LAUGHTER]   Jerry has said “New York City is not the center of 

the art world anymore, but it is the trading floor.”  Do you recall 

that?   

JERRY SALTZ 

[PAUSE]  Yes.  [LAUGHTER]    

JOHN DONVAN  

I hope you stand by it as you argue against the motion, ladies 

and gentlemen, Jerry Saltz.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JERRY SALTZ 

Thank you.  Thank you.  First I wanna say, art is not optional.  

It’s always been here, since the beginning, it has never gone 

away, it’s not going away.  Okay?  It isn’t just a decorative hedge 

that grows in front of a market, or in front of industry or 

philosophy.   Art is a necessity, okay?  It changes the world, it 

won’t reduce the incidence of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa but it 

does change the world incrementally, and/or by osmosis, okay?  

So when you keep talking about the market I want to say to my 

friends on the other side…that almost there’s a self-hating thing 

to your argument to me.   Because, you are representatives of the 

market.  And I have to remind you first of all, 1 percent of 1 

percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of artists actually make money.  

And even they barely do and usually only for a very short time.   

So while—and look at, their clothes are pretty good. [POINTING 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 31. 

 

 

 

TO “FOR” SIDE]  Uh…  [LAUGHTER]  And I’m not against--Mr. 

Feigen just sold a painting for $12 million, that’s great, yesterday, 

and I think you deserve that.  There’s nothing wrong with that.  

[LAUGHTER]    

 

But when we’re standing here talking about secrecy and 

manipulation instead of sorcery or prestidigitation or you’re 

talking about, you’re upset because we’re not regulated.  I don’t 

want us ever to be regulated.   This is the art world…people.  Am 

I yelling?  This—  [LAUGHTER]  If this were the industry, that 

side would be right.  But this is the art world, and a world is a 

place that has a vision, that has problems.  The market is a place 

obviously that people exhibit junkie-like behavior.   Millionaires 

try to enter art history by spending a lot of money.  Sometimes 

the market’s like a friendly Labrador that kind of slobbers all over 

you and it’s very annoying, but you can’t somehow ignore it.  I’m 

not denying, that the market is a combination of hundreds of 

things, be it greed, luck, research, a great eye, and I do know one 

great art dealer in Germany, Johann Koenig, with only one eye, 

and he can only see about 10 percent with that eye, and he is 

one of the best dealers in the world.  [LAUGHTER]  Did I just 

argue against our side?   This is the art world.  It isn’t the art 

industry.  They are appealing—and I like them, you know, I see 

them everywhere—to the cynical side of your nature.  I’m being

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 32. 

 

 

 

honest with you.  The part that goes yeah, it’s all a dirty deal.  

And everybody’s bad, but let me tell you something.  Everybody 

isn’t bad, most people, and certainly…they’re not, but that’s a 

different—  Art dealers, a lot of them are missing the same 

chromosome.  You know?  And it’s very annoying, but I—they 

create worlds…and they pay the bills, they deal with artists, they 

deal with critics, they deal with collectors.   They deal with 

plumbers, they do a lot.  And if they don’t sell 10 shows in a row, 

they will close.  There shouldn’t be regulation, there shouldn’t—  

And you complain because anyone can enter?  I’m gonna be 

honest, I have no degrees at all.    

 

I am so lucky to be here, and I think about it all day every day.  

That I’m—you know how I got in the art world, I went like this.  

I’m in the art world.  [LAUGHTER]  And they said, what are you, 

and I went, uh…I’ll be a critic.  [LAUGHTER]   And that’s how I 

did what I’m doing.  We all are making this up out of ourselves, 

just like you.  To be perfectly honest, we’re all learning on the job.  

Everybody’s learning on the job, all the time, rules, you want to 

start the AEC, no, no, no.  [LAUGHTER]   I mean no offense, I 

love these people but I hate these ideas.  [LAUGHTER, PAUSE]  

Sorry.  We’re not talking about ethics, the art world is ethical, it’s 

not ethical, it’s this, it’s that, it doesn’t compare, it’s not a $15 

billion bubble anywhere, for God’s sake, it’s not nuclear, secrets 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

that are being leaked.    

 

Yes, these guys do know how the secrets are done, and I love that 

they do, and I don’t even hate them for it, I think, fine, that’s part 

of it, that’s part of their game.  But we’re not talking about ethics, 

we’re talking about—aesthetics.   Aesthetics is the type of 

thinking and judgment that we use in the art world, and yes.  

Damien Hirst’s skull cost $100 million, it was very publicly, that 

he was one of the owners of it.  Fine.  Whatever.  But there’s also 

the lifestyles of the poor and famous.   Vito Acconci right now is 

standing around going, uh, I still have no money.  You know.  

Adrian Piper, I’m naming names you might not know.  The point I 

guess I’m trying to make, is the art world will work the way it 

works, it’s time to rethink it.  This is true.   Because, a lot of the 

ideas they’re talking about, and I don’t say this about them, but 

seem very, very yesterday.  And a time long, long ago, and we 

were very lucky to have this very temporary bubble, where 1 

percent of blah-blah-blah made money and that’s great.    

 

I want more artists to make more money, so they don’t have to 

have dark nights of the soul at their jobs for 40 hours.  Now they 

are.  And so are you, and so are they, we’re gonna have to worry 

a little bit more.  But…I think you just have to let the art world 

be what it is.   The rethinking of it has to be look at the huge

white cubes that we now have.  Look, that they may not be 

enhancing the journeys to art, but may have become content in 

themselves.  The same way that the talk about the market, 

hollows out art.   It takes your eyes off the prize, the way Amy 

and Chuck were talking about, and you’re stuck talking about a 

red herring, something that to be perfectly honest, not one 

person this room, not them…  [PAUSE, LAUGHTER]  got into the

So, peace and love.

we look at, whose numbers move by a larger percentage so the 

fact that it’s quite evenly split makes this a pretty good horserace 

at this point but—  At the end of the evening we wanna see who 

actually has a larger number or who has dropped numbers.  Now 

we’re gonna move into the second section of the evening.  And

that’s where the debaters can talk directly to one another.   You’ll 

be involved as audience members, I wanna remind all of you that 

the tone of this part of the debate can be quite informal, you 

don’t need me to be a traffic cop, I will only get involved and pull 

you back if there’s a terrible pile-on…and everyone talking at 

once, but feel free to interrupt each other, to support each other, 

it’s your debate, this part of the evening.   But I wanna start it off 

by asking Michael Hue-Williams who heard the other side 

essentially argue that art is not like other stuff that can be 

regulated, it’s closer to love and you can’t regulate love or 

romance.  What if you take the basic rule…buyer beware, 

whatever happened to that rule and why does that simply not 

apply.  Why doesn’t that take care of all problems.    

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

[PAUSE]  That’s a good question.  I’m not sure I know the answer 

to that.  So I’m gonna…say something completely different, I’m 

gonna say—  [LAUGHTER]   

JOHN DONVAN 

You could be in politics with that.   

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

I’m—  [LAUGHTER]  Yeah, I’m not gonna answer the question at 

all, I’m gonna say that actually…I wanted to agree with Jerry.  

And I wanted to say that, he’s absolutely right, we’re all in this for 

the same reason.  But actually tonight, we’re here to debate a

very specific motion which has nothing to do with the fact …  

[APPLAUSE]  the fact that—   

JERRY SALTZ 

Oh.   

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

—that we are all involved with art because we love it and because 

it’s our lives and because we are not able to do anything else 

[LAUGHS], speaking from my own point of view.  [LAUGHTER]  I 

had to invent a job for myself ‘cause nobody else would have me.   

But actually we’re here because we love art, because it drives us, 

because it thrills us and because, the exciting thing about the art 

world and the people that make it is that it is a…   I always think 

of it as a running race, where the great artists pass the baton 

from one to the other, and the really great artists get to carry it 

forward.  And for me seeing those artists and—   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO

AMY CAPPELLAZZO

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

Trying to help them go forward is a byproduct of what we do, and 

as a gallery, yes, we sell the work but also we sometimes have to

help them create the work.   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO

Acconci.  [LAUGHTER, OVERLAPPING VOICES]

AMY CAPPELLAZZO 

But I’d just like to say—   

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

He’s doing wonderful things.   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO 

Michael, you sort of made a case in favor of regulation being 

something that, you know, normatively affects, that inspires 

ethical behavior, I mean I would like to know…  I do not think 

regulation ensures ethical behavior at all, certainly we’ve seen in 

the stock market that lots of regulation certainly doesn’t ensure 

ethical behavior, we can—violations are tremendous, in fact, this 

idea of the pressure of a common pool or the idea that everybody 

who’s part of the art world… even part of the art market signs up 

for the full ethos here that you love, covet and take care of the art 

and in fact, if people in the art—you know, even the most highly 

compensated people in the art world, could make more if they

chose a different profession, we all know that, so the reward 

system is obviously other as we’ve well-established here—   

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

I think that’s two really important points, first of all we’re not 

actually talking about money here.  We’re talking about ethics.  

And, we’re talking about whether a market is ethical.  Not about 

whether people make lots of money or don’t make lots of money, 

we’re just talking about ethics.    

JERRY SALTZ 

But does—   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO 

Does regulation—   

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

Whether one market or another market is ethic—   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO 

—ensure ethical behavior.    

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

And the other thing I think is really important to understand is 

that, I’m not asking for regulation in the market, I know that that 

won’t happen, and I, yes, okay, mea culpa, I am a cannibal, I am 

eating my own as it were, I’m Jonathan Swift’s modest proposal, I 

am suggesting that we eat our own children, through the market. 

But actually, I am a great devotee of the market, I think that its 

inconsistencies, like Adam, are one of the great attractions of the

market.  And the fact that nothing is ever the same yesterday as 

it will be tomorrow is one of the extraordinary things about the 

art world.    

JERRY SALTZ 

But to—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jerry Saltz—   

JERRY SALTZ 

—say that the art market is inconsistent, I think every—that’s 

built into it.  But inconsistent doesn’t ipso facto mean it’s 

unethical, from here down to there.   Of course there are going to 

be instances of people trying to manipulate any market to try to 

make money.  You’re saying that it is an unethical thing, that is—

No we’re not—   

JERRY SALTZ

you look at the debate motion again, we are saying that it is more 

unethical than the stock market, that’s what we’re debating—

JOHN DONVAN 

Chuck Close—   

CHUCK CLOSE 

Yeah, you’re a second, primarily a second-market dealer, which 

means that you try to buy low and sell high, or like a real estate 

agent, you take things on commission and you hope to sell ‘em 

and collect a commission on that sale.  That’s really not some—

that’s to me not a very important relationship to the art world.  

Certainly not to—  [LAUGHTER]  Not to artists, I mean you’re—

you might be--it’s for dead artists or estates, but I’d like to talk 

about what I think is a real ethical bond between the primary art 

dealer, who represents artists, who believe in that artist, who 

take a risk on that artist, and put that work out there, and make 

that work available. I was a kid from a mill town in the state of 

Washington, I couldn’t believe when I got to New York and there 

was this incredible smorgasbord of art for me to look at, that was 

given to me free of charge by galleries.  I could go in, I could look 

at this work, I was never gonna buy this stuff.  This is a real 

service that the dealer provides.  And they make that artist’s 

work available to collectors, and there are--at first I didn’t wanna 

meet a collector of mine ‘cause what if he or she was a jerk, and 

then I’d say oh my God, that jerk owns my work.  [LAUGHTER]  

So I tried not to meet them.  And then I found out that really 

truly wonderful people out there buy art.  And they give it to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

museums.  And they make it available to other people, if it 

weren’t for really philanthropic people who are a real asset to the 

art world, and this commerce that goes back and forth, it—there 

are people who are speculators.  I mean I was first an advisor to 

Charles Saatchi when he was first buying art, I told him which 

pieces by which artists he oughta buy.  And he bought one of my 

pieces.  I knew right away never to sell another work of art to this 

guy.  I knew he was a speculator, he was gonna make—he liked 

to make and destroy careers.  And—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Chuck, are you switching to the other side of the argument—   

CHUCK CLOSE 

No, I’m—no.  [LAUGHTER]  I’m not, I’m talking about the primary 

role that a gallery plays in an artist’s career, putting that work 

forward, and the responsibility, I hate to see them slammed.  I 

hate to see them talked about as if they were selling hog futures.  

It’s another kind of business.  And we, those of us who make art, 

we appreciate the truly wonderful collectors who are out there.  

Where would museums be without collectors giving their work to 

these museums.  This is a wonderful part of how the art world 

works.

—a thousand dollars—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Adam Lindemann argued that the market is ripe for unethical 

behavior, but you didn’t really gauge whether you think there is a 

lot of unethical behavior going on, you didn’t say one way or the 

other.  And it seems to me relevant to this topic whether we’re 

talking about a few bad apples or are we talking about large-scale 

unethical behavior, and I wanna ask your side if it’s a few bad 

apples then we’re not talking about a huge problem.  But is it 

bigger than that.    

ADAM LINDEMANN 

It seems to me that, the question becomes, you know, is the 

proposition correct, in a systemic definition, or is it correct in 

practice.  Meaning, is the system that is the art market, the 

unregulated art market inherently more open to unethical 

behavior—   

JOHN DONVAN  

And you argued that it was—   

ADAM LINDEMANN 

—than a regulated market.  Now your question is, in practice—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Right.

—is the art market actually unethical.  And I have tremendous 

respect for the other side here.  Speaking of ethics I think that 

had I chosen the other side, I wouldn’t have made the panel 

because they had more people on that side than this one.  So I 

sensed that there was a spot for me over here.  And I’m arguing 

this side…  [LAUGHTER]  Which has a lot to do about art and the 

art market, you know—   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO 

[INAUDIBLE]   

ADAM LINDEMANN 

—you have to feel your way through.   [LAUGHTER]  That being 

said, I—the people that I deal with are the people that I think are 

ethical, I choose people that I have a relationship with…that are 

either my friends or I have a good feeling about them, and do 

things happen, of course, everything happens—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Right—   

ADAM LINDEMANN 

—in this world anything can happen.  That being said, our side 

has definitely--you know, we’re going downhill here in the sense 

that we don’t have any rules in the art market… whereas the 

public is protected by the SEC as we were saying, perhaps 

imperfectly so but that’s the effort, the public can enjoy the art

world that Jerry Saltz has laid out for us and certainly should 

support the art world that Chuck Close has laid out for us and, 

and I do feel very strongly that way.  Nonetheless, there are no 

rules, there’s no inherent value, I mean, the other side literally 

said, let me see here.  Artists… where is it, “There is no intrinsic 

value, only extrinsic value,” that’s Chuck Close’s words so, if 

there is no intrinsic value, then…it’s ripe for unethical behavior.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Let me turn to your teammate, Michael Hue-Williams, and 

Michael, if you can approach your microphone a little bit, I got a 

signal that the radio’s having a little bit of difficulty because of 

the distance.  Are there a lot of unethical players in the art 

market or only a few.   

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

I’m—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Or do you not know because nobody knows.    

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

I’m sure there may be but I’m sure I don’t know them.  

[LAUGHTER]  I think your question is an interesting one but it 

actually has no bearing on the motion that we’re discussing here.  

Because this motion is a purely hypothetical motion, so, I’m 

gonna bring this back, and I’m going to agree with—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 53. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN  

You really don’t like to answer direct questions, do you.  

[LAUGHTER]   

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

Now I’m completely lost.  [LAUGHTER]   I think that the art 

market is open for manipulation because it’s unregulated, I think 

it is unregulated because, historically, it’s found its own way of 

operating because it’s just simply not possible to regulate this 

market, and it would be a ghastly thing, if it ever could be 

regulated.  A lot of the excitement and fun would go out of it.  So 

to answer your question, do I know a lot of bad apples in the art 

market, no.  But the art market, when we have instances of 

things going wrong and manipulations and unethical behavior, 

attracts a huge amount of attention, a disproportionate amount 

of attention because the art market is very exciting, it is very 

well-reported, it always has been, because, it is also the cradle 

of—  It’s an expression of humanity, it’s an expression of 

something that is above the humdrum essence of daily life, it’s 

something that when it is truly great, it takes us into another 

realm, into a realm that hopefully, will have cultural credibility 

for years and decades and centuries to come.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Let’s take a question from the front row, sir.

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

Well, we’ve heard tonight that the artist and the primary dealer 

are the foundation of the art market along with the collector.  But 

we haven’t…and we’ve heard how, secondary dealers and groups 

of collectors can manipulate the market.  But I’m wondering how 

does the art critic fit into this.  Do the Clement Greenburgs of the 

world manipulate the art market, the Jerry Saltzes of the world?  

Where does the critic, critic fit.    

JERRY SALTZ 

That’s a really good question, I think we’re really, once upon a 

time the Clement Greenburgs of the art world, did, and they were 

able to manipulate taste.  And therefore the market.  That time 

luckily is long, long gone.  And that now, I can like this, another 

critic can like that, Michael Wilson can like this, I’m looking at 

art critics in the room—  And it really, we don’t have that kind of 

sway.  I can say that Damien Hirst’s recent paintings were 

absolutely generic, fortieth-generation photorealist paintings… 

which I did write.  And you know how many he sold?  All of them.  

[LAUGHTER]  I’ve done that a lot, and just to show you the other 

side, oh, well, he’s just saying, he’s being…  I’ve written that 

certain young artists are very, very good.  And it doesn’t do, it 

won’t do anything.  It has to be there.  I don’t know what it is.  

You know, if you know, let me know.

Okay, we’re taking questions from the audience.  I’m John

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS  

[OVERLAP]  But can I go another direction with that?    

JOHN DONVAN   

[OVERLAP]  All right, let me, I just need to do this little piece of 

radio and then I’ll come right to you, Michael.  I’m John Donvan, 

your host and moderator, and this is Intelligence Squared U.S., 

Oxford-style debating.  We have six panelists, three for and three 

against this proposition:  The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the 

Stock Market.  We’re returning to our debate with Michael Hue-

Williams.  

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

I just wanted to take you in a slightly different direction.  If you 

go back nearly a hundred years and you think of, not an art critic 

but a very influential art historian --  Bernard Berenson, who was 

in cahoots with Duveen – here you have an incredibly powerful 

manipulation which subsequently many other art historians have 

found to be entirely unethical and which museologists and 

museum directors have had to unravel as a result of the 

collusion between Joseph Duveen and Bernard Berenson.   So, 

I'm just pointing that out as a, a fascinating manipulation of the 

market from an art historical point of view.

JOHN DONVAN   

Take a question in the back.  And I just want to bring a 

microphone down to the front to be ready.  Good.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

I’d like to address the question to the three people on the right 

side – that is, against the motion.  Mr. Feigen and Mr. Hue-

Williams made a number of quite specific assertions about the 

way auctions are manipulated and conducted and the way 

auction houses behave.   And none of the three of you responded 

directly to those assertions.  Could I ask you to do so?   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO 

I suppose I should take that one first, as the auction house 

person on this panel.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Amy Cappellazzo.    

AMY CAPPELLAZZO  

First I would like to say, the only area of the art world that is 

regulated is the auction business, funny enough.  So the 

assertion on this side that the auction business that those – even 

Mr. Rosenkranz in his comments in the beginning brought up the 

auction houses as somehow being involved in something not 

entirely transparent or understandable.   The truth is, it’s the 

only area that’s regulated and in fact, the entire market is 

Byzantine.  And the only little glimmer of transparency comes 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 57. 

 

 

 

when you watch a live auction and watch something trade in real 

time.   So you can sort of understand the depth of market, how 

many people might be bidding.  You might not know who is 

bidding or what exactly is going on but you might count those 

one, two, three, four telephones on that or what’s going on.   

 

I mean, certainly I don’t think everything you’re hearing on this 

panel, while they’re saying part of what makes the art market 

susceptible to corrupt, to unethical behavior is the fact that it’s 

unregulated, nobody on this panel would cry for regulation.   

That would just be a-- it’s too small a market to care, in most ca--

I think that’s really why we’re not regulated.  But also just from a 

sort of a New York would they, Christie’s would simply transfer 

me to London or Paris – cities that would make sure there was no 

regulation and I would be relocated over there and New York 

would have no real trading floor by which to operate that way.   

RICHARD FEIGEN  

Wasn’t that the claim when the question – probably before Amy, 

before you were born.  But I remember back in the –  

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  Richard Feigen.   

RICHARD FEIGEN 

...was it the Sixties or Seventies? --  when the issue was brought 

up about chandelier bidding.

AMY CAPPELLAZZO  

Right.    

RICHARD FEIGEN  

Okay?  And they threatened, the auction houses threatened to 

leave New York City if they passed any regulation against this 

phantom bidding, which is designed to make people think there’s 

a competitor when there isn’t one.   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO  

[OVERLAP]  Just so you know, for the purpose of the audience, I 

will explain what chandelier bidding is, which is the auctioneer is 

allowed to bid on behalf of the seller up to the reserve price.  So 

the point of an auction is that sort of canter and lively chatter 

that goes on where he goes, One hundred, one hundred fifty, two 

hundred, two hundred and fifty.  And you have to get a little 

momentum going.   You can’t say, We’re opening the bidding at 

six hundred.  Anyone?  No, no bid?  Boom, it’s over.  So the 

auctioneer is allowed to bid on behalf of the seller and take bids, 

whether they exist or not, until they get close to the reserved 

price.   That’s part of the dance of the auction, part of the 

momentum, part of the theatre that goes into it.

dealers in the room.  So --    

RICHARD FEIGEN  

 [OVERLAP]  But, Amy, when a new buyer comes along and he

doesn’t have the knowledge of the market or of values, he goes to 

auction and why?  Because it gives him a measure of value.  

Now, he goes in there and he bids.   If he thought that his bid 

could not get the object because the reserve is higher and the 

bidding was fake, he wouldn’t bid.  But they --   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO  

[OVERLAP]  But what’s a --

AMY CAPPELLAZZO  

[OVER CONTINUED APPLAUSE]  Listen, I’m not sure I can take 

on auction as a format.  It’s an ancient method of selling and it’s 

really – You know, I’m not sure someone walks [LAUGHTER]  into 

Feigen Gallery and has a fabulous experience of transparency 

when they’re told what the price is on something.   Or, in the case 

of auction there’s a printed estimate.  There’s sort of a lively 

public discussion about why that might be the estimate.  There’s 

a lot of people that novice collector can go ask and find out why 

the estimate is this.   There’s all sorts of databases they can 

search.  There’s a lot of self-education someone can do on their 

own behalf.   

RICHARD FEIGEN 

[OVERLAP]  Are you telling me that he shouldn’t bid until he gets 

up to the low end of the estimate?    

AMY CAPPELLAZZO  

I’m telling, I would tell him all the time what the strategy is.  The 

auctioneer can take bids to get the sort of rhythm going until he 

hits the reserve price.

My prob...anyone that knows me knows I’m not a big fan of 

auction houses.  I’m sorry, Amy.  But not for these reasons and 

not for the reasons that are part of that kind of arcane business,  

practice that I don’t think very many of us know or care about.   

What bothers me is that all an auction price means is that there 

were two people there that night who thought that that’s what it 

was worth.  And that’s what’s destructive in the art world, 

because a dealer will look at the artist’s career and know that he 

or she cannot ask the most they can possibly ask for that 

painting that day because it’s gonna screw up that artist’s career 

for years to come.  You don’t --

ask for it until it resells.  Then you know what it’s really worth.

Thank you.

And remember to hold that mic pretty close.  That’s good.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER   

Thank you very much.  To return to the question itself, it seems 

self-evident that because of the absence or the limited amount of 

regulation that the potential as opposed to the practice in the art 

market is far greater for unethical behavior, as Adam Lindemann 

was pointing out.   So I think that the answer hinges more on

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 64. 

 

 

 

what sorts of people are drawn into the art market as opposed to 

the stock market.  And Jerry Saltz said something very 

interesting earlier about how he thought that the people in the 

market might be missing a chromosome, the same chromosome.  

Uh --

JERRY SALTZ   

Very quickly.  That’s Jason Kaufman, a very good writer.  I’m 

going to say that I don’t...Look, of course, there’s unethical 

behavior in the art market.  I want to go back to this question.   I 

would never say there isn’t.  I mean, I’m sure people want to 

make money.  But if, just because there is unethical behavior, I 

ask you, is it behavior less ethical than the stock market?  I’m, 

again, asking for your better angels, to understand that of course 

this exists.   So the second you feel like, Oh God, yeah, there’re 

people manipulating the prices --  well, that’s true.  I don’t think 

our side is arguing against that idea.  But we’re saying that’s not 

what it is.  That does not become the definition of it and make it 

worse than the worst thing that’s happened in the United States 

in forty-five years, for God’s sake.  If you really want to make that 

comparison, whoa, [LAUGHTER]  you really hate the art world.

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Does the panel feel that, in fact it’s debating a issue that’s not a 

debate?  That basically, are you voicing that we’re really talking 

about people, and whether the people are in the stock market, 

whether in the art market, whether in the garbage market, it 

really doesn’t matter.  The question of what is ethical behavior, as 

an individual, in whatever market you’re in, would seem to be 

the, can I say the basic premise that, going here is all 

manufacturing.  And I just, I don’t hear enough people talking 

about the fact that they’re really on one side or the other.  And 

that you’re really struggling with the same issue, of, it’s a 

personal matter.  And you can have good ethics, bad ethics, 

anyplace, it’s really a personal question, it’s not a question of 

regulation—I’m sorry, I’m going on.  It’s not a question—   

JOHN DONVAN  

No, actually I think that’s a really excellent question—

together here, we’re for the proposition, they’re against.  

[LAUGHTER]  So if you agree with us, you wanna vote over here.  

[LAUGHTER]  That being said, it was very interesting that, 

Richard was saying something against the auctions…but Chuck 

was chiming in, and so I feel obliged to say something for the 

auction houses, [LAUGHTER]  just to balance it out here.  

Remember, if something sells at auction, somebody bought it.  

That is a fact.  Doesn’t matter if they chandeliered it, doesn’t 

matter if they advertised it, I don’t care if they shined it with shoe 

polish.  Somebody bought it, and we can actually see that.  That 

is not possible in the private market, so…for better or for worse, 

this market wouldn’t exist without the auction houses, and we 

need them as collectors, I think as dealers, and I think, artists 

often don’t understand that, the auction market, the auction 

house actually makes this a market and is ultimately to 

everyone’s benefit.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Question from the far back.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

As a lawyer who defends other lawyers who get into ethical 

trouble, and actually, yes, but it’s not an oxymoron, I—attorney 

ethics.  The question is we have rules, you can’t lie, you can’t 

steal. There are actually defined rules.  Why can’t everybody on 

this panel just agree, that in fact you do need a set of rules, that

question.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER

I don’t know if that’s bad.  I have a painting here I say is worth a 

thousand dollars.  What’s—how are we gonna put a rule on that.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Professor Charles Wolfram said it’s puffery.  There is a subjective 

view, however—   

JERRY SALTZ 

Yes—  

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

—the moment I ask you the question, do you have a valuation in 

your bag for less than that amount, if you do and you say you 

don’t, that is a false statement and therefore it is sanctionable.   

JERRY SALTZ 

I could never go to trial.  [LAUGHTER]  ‘Cause I kinda lost you, 

all I know…  [LAUGHTER]   All I know, is that, I just sold one of 

these for a thousand dollars this morning, and this is by the 

same woman, and it’s a thousand dollars.  And there’s no rule on 

that.  There is no rule, you could sell it for 1200, which is fine

now that the economy’s a little, ehh-ehh-ehh.  [LAUGHTER]  It’s 

fine, there should not be rules in this.  Not the rules you’re

figures his exposure is $50,000, that’s his risk.  He thinks there’s

CHUCK CLOSE 

It was not me but Dave Hickey who said works of art have no 

intrinsic value.  All their value is extrinsic, it is invested from 

without and over a period of time.  And that is truth.  It’s not 

what any—the reason it can’t be regulated is it’s a kind of 

consensus.   A consensus that’s formed, between art critics and 

art dealers, and art historians, and artists themselves.  You can 

hype something for a while, you can spin it, you can try and 

produce, you can try and put it up for auction and manipulate it 

that way.  But finally, it is—the art world is not hog futures.   

When you lose money in the stock market as I just did, I’m not 

gonna hang my stock certificates on the wall.  If I bought 

something I like, and no one else in the world thinks it’s worth 

anything anymore, I at least having something I like.    

 

And that is what makes it different from other kinds of 

investments.  [APPLAUSE]  You can’t just look at it as hog futures  

or pork bellies or anything else.  It is ruled by passion, and it is a 

consensus that’s formed amongst art-world professionals of all 

kinds, and most important by artists themselves.   And you can 

manipulate it up to a point, what good is trying to regulate it 

when it is a self-correcting process.  When the hype and 

everything else falls away, you’ll be looking at the work, and if 

there is not support for that work, if the professionals in the field,

those people who know it and care about it whether in the 

auction houses, whether they’re dealers, whether they’re critics,  

or collectors or artists, that consensus is what forms value and 

nothing else matters.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Chuck Close.  [APPLAUSE]  Making his summary 

statement for the motion, “The art market is less ethical than the 

stock market,” Richard Feigen, an art dealer and collector, 

founder of Richard L. Feigen and Company.    

RICHARD FEIGEN 

I don’t quarrel with anything that Chuck says except, I do not 

believe that it addresses the point of this debate.  [APPLAUSE]  I 

believe that nothing else has much val— intrinsic value than art.  

I don’t believe in anything else, I don’t believe in green pieces of 

paper that they print in Washington, ad infinitum to the trillions 

of dollars.   I believe in art.  However…there is an art market.  

This was created by the press, publicizing these huge prices, and 

by the financial institutions, who are lending money on it, who 

have set up departments to advise their clients on buying art.   It 

has become, it has been transformed, metastasized, into a 

financial market.  And because it is a financial market, for better 

or for worse, although I would prefer that it were not, because I 

am passionate about buying art, I’d rather buy it and this makes 

it more difficult for me, and more expensive for me, the fact is, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 75. 

 

 

 

that it is a financial market.   

 

And as such, it is totally unregulated.  And in my view things go 

on in this market that could not happen in the securities 

markets.  People would go to jail.  Okay, you can’t pretend that 

there’s a buyer when there isn’t, there’s no transparency at all.   

And what I’m saying is, I’m not saying to regulate the prices of art 

because, that is between the artist and his dealer as Chuck says.  

But the fact is nobody is saying—nobody is saying, something 

that’s not true.  I’m saying that, in the auction market, and I 

agree that auctions are indispensable to establish values and for 

people that wanna go in and acquire art—  In that market, there 

is no transparency, and there is deception, deliberate deception.  

And I do believe, that it ought to be regulated.  That this kind of 

activity… Now, I wish all of you to vote [LAUGHS] for our position 

here.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Richard Feigen.  [APPLAUSE]  Summarizing against 

the motion, Amy Cappellazzo, deputy chairman and international 

co-head of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s.   

AMY CAPPELLAZZO 

Feel it’s very important to address Richard directly here in his, 

clear dislike of the auction houses.  Richard, if it weren’t for the 

auction houses bringing liquidity and transparency, what you 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 76. 

 

 

 

would do all day would be a mere curiosity.  So, the market 

depends on the liquidity and transparency that the auction 

houses bring, and remember that the area of the market you’re 

calling the most unethical or potentially corrupt is the only area 

that’s regulated, in fact.  So…positively, I make the proposition, 

that this is way too specific an argument, that auction is an 

ancient art form and a completely legitimate way to sell 

something in the world and there’s a sort of ancient rhythm and 

dance to auction that, people seem to accept and understand.  

And there’s many ways for consumers to become informed. 

 

To go back to the proposition, I think my hypothesis is anybody 

who signs up for the art world, signs up to participate by a 

certain set of values and ideas about how we look after and take 

care of the art, I mean…some of us are compensated well but no 

one’s in it for the dough.  There is definitely another motive to be 

involved.   And art exists with this larger art world that is the 

kind of moral and ethical conscience of what the market does.  If 

you don’t have street cred, and soul, you ain’t gonna go very far 

in the art market.  So I argue the proposition that, in fact the art 

world is at least as ethical as the stock market if not vastly more 

so, that individual people are unethical in their behavior and we 

all know them in every single industry, and the system of the art 

world, in fact, stands to be potentially more ethical because, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market” (2/3/09) Page 77. 

 

 

 

there are all sorts of various motives to be involved but primarily 

it’s for the—for the love of the art itself.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Amy Cappellazzo.  [LAUGHTER]  Summarizing for the 

motion, Michael Hue-Williams, founder of the Albion Gallery.    

MICHAEL HUE-WILLIAMS 

I wanted to remind you, the idea that regulations are what force 

ethics, and in an unregulated market like the art market, it is 

hard to force people to adhere to ethical principles.  Without 

ethical principles however, and with the manipulations of market, 

we can look, for instance, to the tulip market in 1636.  We create 

bubbles, and these bubbles are intrinsically unhealthy.   

You may all know Charles Mackay’s extraordinary book, 

Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.   

 

People follow each other, because they feel that there are 

financial opportunities.  Especially when these markets are 

unregulated.  The tulip market crashed, but it was regulated by 

the Dutch government, rather too late.   But, the point here is, 

that the art market is unregulated, it is open to unethical 

behavior because it’s unregulated.  Not how often is it 

unregulated, but the fact that it, it is intrinsically unethical 

because it is, as I said before, it is not regulated, it is not 

transparent, and there are, most importantly, absolutely no

barriers to entry.   So that anybody may come in and manipulate 

the market.  Whether we like them or dislike them, whether we 

admire them or not, is absolutely irrelevant.  The important point 

here, is to remember that, the market is intrinsically open to 

manipulation, and intrinsically unethical.   Whether it’s actually 

happening or not, is not important to the debate tonight.  What is 

important is to understand, that the market is intrinsically 

unethical.

Art first, everything else follows.  There has been an art market 

since the Renaissance.  Right now, we’ve just finished a time of 

the biggest art market on the face of the earth.  And now that art 

market is contracting.  And in the coming years, a lot is going to 

change.   Things will herniate out, other dealers, critics, 

collectors…et cetera, that we can’t yet see.  I would say that, art 

is a way of knowing the world, and a way of knowing yourself.  

Art will have— the art market, became content for the art world.   

 

It’s content for a lot of you right now—I want you to vote for our 

side, for us…but also for you, if I can say something that’s

egotistical, because…  [PAUSE]  If you’re only seeing art for its 

value, and saying that it’s…of course it’s going to be unethical.  

The people that buy and sell it.  That almost goes without saying.  

But is it really more unethical, than what’s going on out there?  

Real pain?  Real serious stuff, world-changing economic stuff?  If 

you think that, then you really—I just wanna say when you go to 

an art gallery or museum…that could be in your way.   That you 

think that all of this is unethical.  That unethical.  Yeah, it’s 

unethical, but…  [LAUGHTER]  No more than you are.  

[LAUGHTER]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Jerry Saltz.  [APPLAUSE]  Finally summarizing for the 

motion that the art market is less ethical than the stock market,

contemporary art.   

ADAM LINDEMANN 

Thank you, John.  [LAUGHS]  The, Jerry, I just wanna say—  

[MICROPHONE FEEDBACK]  to all of you over there, I do feel for 

you, and I’m with you…  [LAUGHTER]  But, of course, I’m with 

my teammates here and—  [LAUGHTER]  I appreciate the difficult 

time you’ve had tonight…  [LAUGHTER]  And I love—

The feeling is mutual—

ADAM LINDEMANN 

—everything that you said, you know, but the real—a minute 30, 

okay.  Art is based on two things as far as I can tell, and, Jerry 

said we’re all learning on the job, and I—you know what, I 

couldn’t agree more.  I’m learning right now.   But the two C’s are 

consensus and confidence, and these are there, things that the 

art market is built on, so what makes a great artist.  It’s sort of 

this Platonic concept, is there such a thing as great art?    

 

Perhaps, but, in whose mind, the thing that makes art valuable is 

consensus, what makes Picasso Picasso, because everyone 

thinks he’s great.  Someone thinks he’s crap and that doesn’t 

really matter because people are still paying a lotta money for it.   

So, consensus is what makes the art market, and then we need 

that extra thing that often the auction house brings, a dealer can 

bring, which is confidence, and, those are the two things that, 

that make us feel comfortable with art being valuable.   The 

reality is though that the ethical side is up to the individual that 

you’re dealing with.  There is no way to guarantee that anything 

is worth anything.  And so, when we’re speaking in terms of Dave 

Hickey’s intrinsic and extrinsic value, the intrinsic value of art, is 

perhaps infinite.  But the extrinsic value is really something that 

is almost impossible to measure on any given day.
