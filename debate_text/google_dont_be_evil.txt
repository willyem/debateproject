JOHN DONVAN 

Hello, everyone.  Welcome to our fourth Intelligence Squared US 

debate of the season, I’m John Donvan, your moderator, and I 

just want to give you a preliminary introduction.  We’ll be doing a 

more formal introduction once the program begins…   

 

At this point our debaters and panelists are coming to the stage, 

I’d just like to welcome them with a round of applause.  

[APPLAUSE]  And I would further like to introduce the CEO of 

Intelligence Squared US, Mr. Robert Rosenkranz.   

[APPLAUSE]   

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Greetings, welcome, thanks for being here.  As is typical on these

occasions I try to frame the evening’s debate.  And when you 

think about Google, I mean here’s a company that was founded 

by two Stanford University graduate students just about 10 years 

ago.   One of them was an immigrant to this country.  They’ve 

created among them an enterprise that is basically the first place 

that almost everybody goes for information about anything, it’s 

an extraordinary achievement.  They’ve completely revolutionized 

the advertising industry by enabling advertisers to very efficiently 

reach the individuals they want to reach that are interested in 

their products… and it’s the amounts— the sums that are paid 

by the advertisers that make these services possible for 

everybody else as well as having created enormous fortunes for 

the founders of the company and their shareholders.   

 

They’ve created a unique corporate culture, a corporate culture 

that is highly entrepreneurial, very inventive, embraces change, I 

mean it’s an American dream kind of company.  So, what’s the 

debate, where’s the other side of this equation.  It comes in a 

number of categories, the first I would say is privacy.  Google is 

so ubiquitous, if you put your telephone number in that little 

box, it comes up with your name and address.   If you put your 

address in Google maps, it can show you a photograph of people 

going in and out of your building.  If you’ve ever made a political 

contribution, it’s on Google.  Virtually every detail of anything

you’ve ever published, everything that’s ever been in print about 

you is part of a permanent record that can be accessed on 

Google.   

 

So, this sense of pervasiveness, the sense that Google knows so 

much about all of us, is worrisome to people, and with good 

reason.  And then there are other issues involving personal 

freedom and you see that mostly in China, at least in terms of the 

news, where Google has been cooperating with the Chinese 

government in censorship of the Internet and maybe in other 

ways that we don’t know about, so we think this is a motion 

where there’s a lot to be said on both sides, we have an 

outstanding panel, and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over 

to John Donvan.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Robert, may I invite one more round of applause for 

Mr. Rosenkranz.  [APPLAUSE]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to 

an Intelligence Squared US, Oxford-style debating, live from the 

Caspary Auditorium at the Rockefeller University.   The motion 

before us tonight is, “Google Violates it’s ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto.”  

We will be hearing from two teams of three panelists each in 

debate.  This debate will take place in three parts.  There will be 

opening statements, followed by a round of direct debate among

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 4. 

 

 

 

the panelists and that will also include questions from you the 

audience,  and then we will have a brief period of summing up by 

each of the debaters.  In the opening round they are each given 

seven minutes, and we will have a warning sound for each 

panelist as they approach minute six…it will sound like this—  

[WARNING TONE]   Clear?  And at seven minutes, if the speaker 

has not finished speaking, it will sound like this.  [WARNING 

TONE REPEATS]  And on, and on…  [LAUGHS]  and on it will go.   

 

This is a contest, it’s a contest of wit and logic and ideas and 

persuasion, and you the audience are the prize in that contest, 

you are the judges and your votes will determine who is the 

winner of the evening, and to that end we’re asking all of you at 

this point, to express your point of view on the motion now, 

before having heard any of the actual debate and argument.  You 

each have the keypad at your seat, if you agree with the motion 

that “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto,” press button 

number 1, if you disagree press button number 2, and if you are 

undecided, press button number 3.  I’ll be sharing those results 

in a short time after we hear the opening round completed.  Is 

everybody—  Anybody need more time?  [PAUSE]  All right.  

Restating once again…this Intelligence Squared US debate, our 

fourth debate in the series, the premise is, the motion is that 

“Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto,” and you may have

noticed that Google itself is not represented on our panel tonight,  

suffice to say that, the company was made aware of this debate, 

and was invited to participate.  Now, let’s let the debating begin, 

we’re going first to argue for the motion, Randal Picker, a 

professor of commercial law at the University of Chicago Law 

School, and a senior fellow at the Computation Institute of the 

University of Chicago, ladies and gentlemen, Randal Picker.   

[APPLAUSE]   

RANDAL PICKER 

Thank you very much.  I want to thank Intelligence Squared and 

the Rosenkranz Foundation for organizing what I think will be a 

fun and lively evening.  So, the resolution before us is that 

“Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto,” I think it’s important 

for us to frame that and understand what that means and what it 

doesn’t mean.  The question isn’t whether Google is a great 

company.  I think it is.  I thought what Bob Rosenkranz said 

about it is exactly right, much to admire.  The question isn’t 

whether Google does more good than evil.  I think it does.  That’s 

not the question either.   

 

The question’s whether we can identify certain things which they 

do which we think are important to how Google operates, that are 

inconsistent with that motto.  And I think we can.  So we should 

start where that motto comes from.  When Google was going to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 6. 

 

 

 

become a public company it filed its registration statement, if you 

haven’t read those, they’re remarkably dull.  [LAUGHTER]  Not 

Google’s.  Google opens with an owner’s manual for future Google 

shareholders.  Page and Brin say, we’re not an ordinary 

company, we’re not gonna be an ordinary company.  Get ready 

for the ride.  Okay.  Part of that is Google says, we’re gonna live 

by a motto, and that model is, is we’re not gonna be evil.   

Seemingly asking us to hold Google to a higher standard, they’re 

very clear.  There’ll be times when they will sacrifice the short-

run interests of Google for the public good.  I don’t think what’s 

legal is the standard to evaluate for Google, Google asks us for 

something much more public-interested.   

 

Google then compares itself to newspapers.  Well that’s 

interesting, right, they seem to be on diverging paths but I think 

they thought there was some sense of a public trust associated 

with newspapers, and we should hold Google to that as well.  

That’s what we’re gonna try to do tonight.  My piece of this is I’m 

going to focus on the heart of Google’s business which is their 

advertising model.   And I’m going to focus on the recent deal that 

was proposed between Google and Yahoo, where Yahoo was going 

to out-source a large chunk of its search-ad business to Google.  

I should say I consulted in connection with the opposition, so you 

can discount what I say as you wish.  I should say we won, that’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 7. 

 

 

 

good news, because that deal has gone away, the Department of 

Justice suggested that they were going to challenge the deal in 

court…that was something clearly Google didn’t want so they 

backed away from it.   

 

All right.  Advertisers were opposed to the deal.  Why were 

advertisers opposed.  Advertisers believed that the deal and the 

core of the deal was if you think of search queries, there’s a lot of 

common queries, there’s a lot of unusual queries.  The deal is 

going to out-source the long tail as it were, Chris Anderson’s term 

of queries, away from Yahoo to Google.   Advertisers were upset 

about that.  Why.  Well, advertisers believed that prices were 

going to go up because of that.  Google’s response to that was to 

say…we run auctions.  We don’t set prices.  Advertisers set 

prices.  We’re just middlemen.   That’s not right, and I think 

Google knows better.  I should say, I’m  a Google Ad Words 

advertiser, so if you’ve not looked at the system, the way it works, 

you can set an account up very easily, pay five dollars to do so…   

 

I’m advertising, I thought I should understand how Ad Words 

works, so I’m advertising a paper that I wrote on anti-trust and 

privacy and cloud computing.  I’m not sure who the second click 

has been, um—  [LAUGHTER]   Okay.  But you see how that 

works.  You can click, and go.  But the nature of this is that you 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 8. 

 

 

 

bid on keyword terms, if you win the auction your ads are 

supposed to show up.   Now Google understands that how you 

design auctions matters, there’s a whole field of economics 

devoted to that.  They gave William Vickery from Columbia a 

Nobel Prize for that.  Google is designing its auctions in a way 

that takes advantage of its market power.  Does that in three 

important ways.  First, Google runs a system involving minimum 

bids.  So cloud neutrality is one of the terms that I’m bidding on.  

You can run a search on cloud neutrality, I did yesterday.   

 

I know my ad is out there.  It didn’t show up, indeed no ads 

showed up, and indeed if you look at the statistics, 50 percent of 

the time when you run a search on Google, and they produce 

results, the organic search results, there are no ads next to it.   

Even though if you believe the comments, and as I say I’m one of 

these Ad Words ad—Ad Words advertisers, my ad is out there 

waiting to be served and even though the search that has been 

done, if they don’t run an ad it’s an opportunity to show an ad 

which is lost forever.   So there was a chance for Google to get 

money there and yet they’re not doing it.  Why, because if very 

few people are bidding then I ought to be able to buy it for a very 

low price and Google’s interest is not served by that.  

 

Google wants to make sure that there’s a high enough minimum, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 9. 

 

 

 

they’ve been raising the minimums over time, such that Google 

meaningfully makes money on that.  If you look at the blogs, 

people comment on this, they talk about bidding against the 

house, that’s what they have to do.  And Google has changed the 

terms in which they do that.  Okay?  That’s an exercise in market 

power.  I should say under current US anti-trust law one of the 

things I do for a living, I don’t think that’s illegal.  Evil?  Well, 

that’s the resolution for the house tonight.  That’s one.  Two.  If 

you’re an auctioneer, the way you exercise market power, is you 

control the number of slots.  Right, you don’t control prices, you 

control quantities.  In Google’s case that means how many slots 

are available on the right-and side next to the organic search 

results.  Google controls that.  Now you might think in a 

competitive model that we’d have some relationship between the 

number of ads on Yahoo and the number of ads on Google.   

 

Indeed the central premise of the Yahoo-Google deal was that 

Google does [WARNING TONE] a better job of ad matching than 

Yahoo does.  We should therefore expect Google to have more ads 

than Yahoo, just the opposite.  Again, market power being 

exercised, not illegal, evil, you decide.   Finally, third point.  

Google engages in a kind of bundling, so Google also organizes 

search for Ask and AOL.  You can buy Google alone, you can’t 

buy Ask and AOL alone.  They are bundled together with Google.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 10. 

 

 

 

Right, advertisers would like to be able to advertise separately on 

those.  Can’t do it, they won’t let you do that.  Illegal under US 

law, EU law?  Maybe, we’ll see.  Right?  Evil, mmm, I think you 

can conclude.  Now, why should we care about this.   The 

importance of advertising is the way that advertising supports 

paid content.  Right?  You should care a lot about the kind of 

content that’s out there, and to the extent that the middleman is 

making it more expensive for people to reach consumers, we’re 

going to have less content because producers are effectively going 

to get a lower chunk of the advertising dollars.  [WARNING TONE 

REPEATS]  I’ll stop there, thank you.

Thank you, Randy Picker.  Our next speaker speaking against 

the motion in this US Intelligence Squared debate, Jim Harper, 

who…though arguing on this side is not somebody unconcerned 

about privacy,  in fact when he was a consultant for the 

Department of Homeland Security he argued vociferously against 

the introduction of a national identity card on privacy grounds, 

as director of Information Policy Studios at the Cato Institute, he 

is our second speaker, speaking against the motion that “Google 

Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto.”  Jim Harper.

JIM HARPER 

Ladies and gentlemen, it takes a lawyer to know a lawyer.  And as 

a lawyer I want to point out what my colleague just did at the 

beginning of his talk, he redefined the question.  The question 

tonight is whether “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto.”   

The question is whether Google is evil or not.  And that’s what I 

want to talk to you about, and I want to urge you to vote no on 

the resolution.  To find that Google is evil, you have to find that 

people who cut in line are evil.  You have to find that, bruised 

apples are evil.   You have to find that flat tires are evil.  These 

things are not evil.  Evil is Hitler.  Evil is Stalin.  Evil is Pol Pot.  

Evil is…Dr. Evil.  [LAUGHTER]  That’s somewhat definitional.  

[LAUGHTER]   

 

Google is not evil.  Now you have to make some sense of the term 

to understand these concepts, now...perhaps that phrase was 

intended in a sort of, “Let’s not be a greasy corporation” sense.  

Even by that standard, Google is not evil, Google is great.   

Google brings information and empowerment to the masses in 

ways we couldn’t have imagined just a few years ago.  Try it now.  

Think about how you would you have found out information just 

a few years ago.   It’s a little hard to remember for oldsters like 

me, but it was very hard.  Today it’s much easier.  Now there are 

lots of complaints about Google.  Holders of copyrights, say 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 12. 

 

 

 

Google’s making use of my copyrights and my property and da-

da.   In fact Google’s making that material more available and 

more valuable for copyright holders.  Holders of trademarks 

complain precisely because Google is using trademarks in an 

appropriate way, in Ad Sense, allowing providers to compare their 

products with other products, bringing consumers lower prices, 

better products…  This is good, this is not evil.   

 

Now surely Google should avoid censorship.  And one of the 

toughest areas is the question of censorship.  But the Chinese 

people are better off, with Google in China, slow-wokking their 

cooperation with the Chinese government, than having no Google 

in China, and leaving China to Baidu, and whatever local 

information sources are fully government-approved.   On the 

question of privacy it’s true, that Gmail, Basic Search, Maps, 

Street View, all of these things, challenge privacy.  All of these 

things are challenges to privacy, but no more than any other 

apps that are available similarly.  This is not a case that Google is 

evil, perhaps it’s a case that the Internet is evil.  But I don’t think 

anybody here thinks of the Internet as truly evil.  Now, some say 

that Google’s monopoly on search, gives it so much power that 

this is inherently, somehow evil.    

 

Well, Google has a sizable percentage of the search market.  I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 13. 

 

 

 

think that’s an admission I can make.  But Google is a big 

company, that’s part of an information big bang, that’s far bigger.  

Google cannot control us finding out about things.  Google 

cannot prevent criticisms of Google being made.  Google’s a big 

player, but the market is much, much bigger than Google.  

There’s a more concerning evil, that I want to point you to, and I 

know none of you indulge this.  But some people, who have 

problems with the way products and services are delivered, do 

nothing but complain.  [LAUGHTER]   That’s the evil of apathy.  If 

my colleagues at the far end of the table wish to characterize 

Google as evil, they should foreswear the use of Google products, 

and find the other products, which there are, and use those 

instead.   Google’s not evil.  In fact… Google’s not evil, Google’s 

Evel Knievel.  [LAUGHTER]  Google’s high-flying…Google makes 

some mistakes.  But Google is an American success story.  Let 

me urge you once again, to vote no on the proposition.  Thank 

you.  

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Jim Harper.  Arguing next for the motion, Harry 

Lewis, a professor of computer science in the School of 

Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, who has 

something to disclose…  Though he’s arguing this side of the 

motion, his daughter is actually a Google employee.  [LAUGHTER]

Harry Lewis.    

HARRY LEWIS 

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you all for being here tonight, 

what a great audience, I have a very simple way of stating my 

case for the motion.  And it’s a conclusion that’s based on some 

facts, facts are good, so here are a few facts.   If you Google 

“Tibetan independence,” you’ll get back pointers to some sites, 

that advocate the freedom of Tibet from Chinese rule.  Tibet.org, 

Friends of Tibet.org, sites associated with the Dalai Lama, and 

others.   You’ll also get back some sites, that advocate against the 

freedom of Tibet from Chinese rule.  That’s if you go home 

tonight, and use the version of Google that you have available to 

you in this country.  But if you do it inside China, you won’t get 

references to Tibet.org, or Friends of Tibet.org, except perhaps, 

for references, to sites explaining that those are illegal and 

banned organizations.   Or Epic Times, Epic Times is a Chinese 

newspaper, an uncensored Chinese newspaper.  You can find it 

on the Internet, just Google Epic Times.  But try to do that in 

China, and you will not find your way to Epic Times.  Same thing 

with human rights if you Google that, or various spiritual 

practices.   The world looks very different through the window 

that Google provides, in China, than through the window on the 

world that you have available to yourselves here.  In fact, it’s not 

the picture window on the world, it’s a distorted lens that has 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 15. 

 

 

 

been built, custom-built by Google to Chinese specifications.   

 

Now how did that happen.  Google is the company, whose 

mission is to organize the world’s information, and to make it 

universally accessible and useful.  How did it come to be in the 

business of creating the distorting lens, rather than the picture 

window on the world.  Well, in 2004, Google was entering the 

international market, it wanted to be the number-one search 

engine in the world, it started to do business in China.   And the 

Chinese said, we don’t want you to show our citizens the world as 

it really is, with all of its complexities, and its contradictions, and 

its inconsistent sources of information.  We want the Chinese 

citizens to know the world the way we want them to know the 

world.  And, Google said, okay, we’ll give them that world instead 

of the world as it really is.   

 

Their choice was, to accept the Chinese ultimatum, or to go 

home.  They could’ve gone home, they didn’t, they stayed, and 

built the engine as the Chinese wanted it.  Now it’s a wonderful 

product.  I agree with everything that’s been said about what a 

wonderful product it is and what a wonderful company it is.   But 

here it’s been turned from a wonderful product, that we know, 

into an instrument of thought control.  Now some may weakly 

claim that it’s doing more good than harm…  that the Chinese 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 16. 

 

 

 

people are better off getting partial information via the Google 

search window than getting no information at all.   That’s 

nonsense, there are other search warrants, through which you 

can get the censored truth, if that’s what you want people to 

provide.  Google didn’t choose the lesser of two evils when faced 

with the Chinese ultimatum; it chose the more profitable of the 

two evils.   

 

And for that reason, you should vote for the proposition, that 

Google is violating its “Don’t be evil” motto.  They had a simple 

choice that was put before them.  I stopped a street vendor here 

in New York last week, who was selling Tibetan jewelry, he’s a 

Tibetan.   And I said, I’m gonna debate this issue.  What do you 

think the answer is, I don’t have to explain it to him, he knew 

exactly that Google works differently inside China, than it does 

here.  And here is what he said—he said, Google had a choice 

between morality and money, and it chose money.   That’s why 

Google is violating its ‘Don’t be evil’ motto.  It’s a company that 

does many good works.  It’s true that Google as a whole is not 

evil, I’ll grant that, but that’s not the question before us.  If the 

question before us was, Google is evil, that’s what the question 

would be.    

 

That isn’t the question, the question is, does it violate what it 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 17. 

 

 

 

claims not to do—not being evil.  A good indicator that you’re 

doing something wrong is that the Congress hauls your 

executives, in front of them, and yells at you.   And Congress has 

gotten into the habit of doing this several times.  Most recently in 

May.  Senator Richard Durbin confronted Google executives on 

this censorship question, and said, “When you’re asked to be 

complicit in restricting the flow of information, aren’t your hands 

a little dirty at the end of the day if you participate in that.”   

There is legislation under consideration, to prohibit exactly what 

Google is doing.  Now to be sure, Google is in the business to 

make money, if it doesn’t sell advertising anywhere, then it’s not 

going to make money, but it’s making plenty of money.  And it 

would have been such a statement, to the international world 

about the importance of, of information freedom.   

 

My friends, you are here tonight, because you value the robust 

debate of conflicting ideas.  You value facts, you believe 

[WARNING TONE] the truth is revealed, through this kind of 

debate and conflict.  You should—you must vote for this 

proposition, if you support the idea that creating censorship tools 

is a form of evil.   Finally, just let me close with one analogy.  

Suppose Google were not a search engine company, but a 

pharmaceutical company.  And it was told by the Chinese 

government that it could sell aspirin in China, only if it also made 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 18. 

 

 

 

certain forms of brainwashing drugs and thought control 

medications.  And that was the condition on which it could sell 

aspirin in China.  No responsible American company would make 

that deal with the Chinese authorities, and that is exactly what 

Google is doing in the digital realm.  So, please vote for the 

motion, “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto”, because they 

do.  Thank you.

cosmonaut.    

ESTHER DYSON 

Yes.  Uh—  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  So I was going to start by 

saying that I actually spend a fair amount of time with things I 

consider evil.  And I mean that quite seriously, the old Soviet 

system, which, you still see some vestiges of, in Star City where 

I’m training.  I travel a lot, I’ve seen many ways to be evil, I’ve 

examined governments, I’ve talked to people who…  I’m on the 

board of the National Endowment for Democracy, and we give 

grants to dissidents, so, that informs my thinking, as does the 

fact that I was chairman of ICANN, which is the organization that 

sets policy for the Internet.   We made a lot of mistakes, I don’t 

think we were evil but we probably came a lot closer to it than 

Google ever did, or will.  But finally in terms of the disclosures 

you probably want to know, I’m on the board of 23andMe which 

was founded, cofounded by Sergey Brin’s wife.   

 

I’m on the board of WPP Group, which calls Google its frenemy, 

or its froe.  They’re a large advertising conglomerate.  And finally, 

I’m on the board of Yandex, which competes with Google in 

Russia where, Yandex has 60 percent market share and Google 

has approximately 20.   So I kind of come at this from many 

different points of view.  And, I believe that Google does not 

violate it’s “Don’t be evil” motto because I’ve seen it up close, I’ve

also seen it from outside, I’ve seen it as a competitor, I’ve seen 

how they try to do things.   And I am very glad to hear all this 

discussion of China because I’m going to blow it to bits in a few 

moments.  But first I want to go through the few…the couple of 

arguments I wanted to talk about.   

 

The challenge of power, is great.  The great virtue of the Internet 

is that it erodes power, it sucks power out of the center, and 

takes it to the periphery, it erodes the power of institutions over 

people, while giving to individuals the power to run their own 

lives.   Google is part of that.  It’s one of these things that shines 

light on everything, it enables people to find stuff out, it enables 

them to question what their governments are doing, and it’s 

absolutely wonderful.  That doesn’t mean that power cannot be 

abused.   The abuse of power is absolutely evil.  Google to some 

extent understands this very well, that’s why they bothered to 

have this motto in the first place, they understand the danger of 

concentration of power, and they understand how important it is 

not to be evil, that’s why they have shareholder agreements that 

give them more power so that they don’t need to cater only to 

money-hungry investors but can also do what they think is right.  

There are three people who set policies there, it’s the two 

founders and Eric Schmidt.  And they watch one another, they’re 

very careful not to abuse this “Don’t be evil” thing.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 21. 

 

 

 

 

Now, the power that Google has is primarily a good power though 

it could be used to do evil, it’s not like atom bombs.  It’s not like 

guns…or even cigarettes, which when used correctly are 

destructive.  The power of transparency, the power of knowledge, 

is fundamentally good, even though it can on occasion be used 

for bad.  And so Google’s trust is to ensure that that power is 

used for good as much as possible.   I have seen what they’re 

doing in China.  And ladies and gentlemen, the reason they’re not 

violating their “Don’t be evil” policy is because they’re in there, 

and they’re engaged.  Yes, they could abdicate, they could say 

we’re not gonna bother to go into China.   But every time some 

Chinese person uses Google, and doesn’t get what he wants, he 

may notice, he may not even notice the absence, but he does 

know that he can go find out all the negative information on 

George Bush he wants.   

 

And at some point, he or she says, well, gee.  If I can get—or 

whatever the Chinese version is—if I can get this bad information 

about George Bush why can’t I find out more about what’s going 

on in my own country.   Google by its very presence and its 

operation, even if it’s incomplete, creates increasing expectations 

for transparency, it starts people answering questions.  It gets 

them to expect to be able to find out stuff.  And it knows that by 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 22. 

 

 

 

doing that, people are going to start asking more questions.   So I 

think Google was doing the right thing, by going into China.  I 

don’t think they’re making that much money there, if they are 

that’s fine too.  But the point of it is, they are engaging.  I know 

another example, in which they’re getting engaged.   They have a 

service, you’ve probably encountered it, where if you go to a 

website—if you get a search result that indicates a website that 

may have some malware on it, they warn you off.   

 

This is very expensive for them to do.  They need to detect the 

sites with malware, they need to inform them that there’s 

malware.  They have a dispute-resolution process, they’re not 

perfect, but again, they’re engaging where they didn’t need to.   

They could easily have just passed the query through.  But 

they’re trying to make the world a better place, by doing 

something that requires them to make judgments.  Sometimes 

they may incorrectly flag a site as having malware, sometimes, 

somebody has malware unintentionally, they need to deal with it.   

So the point here again is that rather than just being apathetic, 

as Jim [WARNING TONE] said, they’re engaging, and trying to 

make the world a better place.  So I believe, that they do not 

violate their motto and I think you should vote against the 

proposition.  Thank you.

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Esther Dyson.  Our next speaker runs a blog, the 

name of which will tell you a great deal.  It is…Googlization of 

Everything.com.  [LAUGHTER]  Siva Vaidhyanathan is Associate 

Professor of Media Studies and Law at the University of Virginia, 

and he is also turning his blog ultimately into a book, the kind of 

book that depends on paper and dead trees…I assume.  Siva, the 

floor is yours.    

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  To my distinguished 

opponents, I see your Dr. Evil and your Dr. Pol Pot, and I raise 

you a pope and a poet.  Specifically, Pope Gregory the Great, and 

the great poet Dante Alighieri.  Because after all, one of the 

things we have to figure out here, is what do we mean by evil.   

Well Google encourages us to think algorithmically, after all it’s 

built everything that it has on algorithms.  One of the simplest 

forms of algorithms, the if-then statement, or if you prefer, the 

checklist, Dante offers us such a checklist in The Divine Comedy.   

I know you know it, I know you know it with me, so say it along 

with me, the seven deadly sins, luxuria, gula, avaritia, acedia, ira, 

invidia, and superbia, right?  Well, okay, you didn’t say it along 

with me.   To walk through, I can show you that Google has at 

times committed every single one of these seven deadly sins.  

[LAUGHTER]  The first, luxuria, which translates as extravagance 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 24. 

 

 

 

or lust.  I spent a bit of time on the Google campus out in 

California…they get massages.  [LAUGHTER]   Right, the people 

who work there get massages.  That is, that is corporeal lust of 

the highest order.  [LAUGHTER]  Or at least for a bunch of geeks 

about the best they’re gonna do.  Um…  [LAUGHTER]   

 

Number two, gula or gluttony, the other thing about the Google 

campus is they get incredible food, all they can eat all day, no 

matter what they want, there is so much food that they never 

need to say no, that is the very definition of gluttony.   Number 

three.  Avaritia, greed.  We’ve already heard from Randy about the 

greed embodied in the Google-Yahoo advertising deal…that is one 

of many examples of Google overreaching to corner a market, or 

completely undermine a market, in an effort to maximize its 

returns.  Number four, acedia, sloth.  Now I could talk about how 

lazy and self-satisfied Google was in its effort to roll out an on-

line video service.   The early days of Google Video were very 

much a matter of figuring they owned the video realm and they 

weren’t actually gonna do anything new or fantastic until these 

whippersnappers at YouTube came across with their Flash video 

platform, and basically ran around them to the point where they 

ended up having to buy that company just to keep pace.   

 

But there’s actually a better example of sloth and that is Google 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 25. 

 

 

 

itself, its very nature, its very model of advertising is based on 

free-riding.  Google makes money off of our work.  We blog, we 

put our skate—our cats on skateboards and record them for 

videos.  We do all of this work, and then Google harvests our 

work, runs all of this content through this computers, spits it 

back out at us, with almost no actual value added and what we 

end up getting is a tremendous amount of money, based on free-

riding, the very definition of sloth.   Wrath, ira, wrath.  There are 

a number of high-profile cases of people who have been involved 

with Google through their Ad Sense program, through which 

they’ve agreed to place ads on their own blogs.  I think Jeff is one 

of these people but not one who has suffered the wrath of Google.   

Many of these people have found their accounts shut down, their 

revenues stopped, for reasons that can never be explained, but 

they did something to violate Google’s policies.  But they get no 

feedback and no response, and no justice.   

 

And then there are hundreds of small companies all around 

America, that have found their ranks decimated, their Google 

ranks decline significantly, because again, they tried to optimize 

their results, they were just doing what a company should do, 

trying to get more attention for themselves.   And Google’s 

algorithms, its faceless, soulless algorithms came at them with 

wrath, another of the seven deadly sins.  Invidia, envy.  Google

has over the last few years engaged in a series of efforts to try to 

muscle in on the markets of other successful companies, 

Microsoft being the most prominent.   

 

Google has recently tried to push its suite of services that directly 

compete with Microsoft Office.  Of course they have at various 

times threatened to muscle out eBay, muscle out PayPal, muscle 

out Amazon, in various ways.  Number seven, the one I want to 

talk about the most, superbia, pride, or hubris.   Now, let me 

remind you of the actual motto of the company, it’s not “Do no 

evil” or “Don’t be evil,” it’s actually, “To organize the world’s 

information to make it universally accessible.”  What could be 

more hubristic than that.  What could be more prideful than that.   

General Motors doesn’t say we’re gonna organize all the places in 

the country and make them universally accessible.  General 

Motors says we’re gonna try to sell cars.  Not that that’s the best 

example to use this week, I understand.  [LAUGHTER]   

Nonetheless, no company besides Google would ever come up 

with a motto or a mission statement like that, but let me tell you 

something that Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google said a 

number of years ago, during an interview when someone asked 

him, what would the perfect search engine be like.   

 

And he said, without missing a beat, it would be like the mind of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 27. 

 

 

 

God.  Ladies and gentlemen, that’s more than hubris, that’s 

blasphemy.  [LAUGHTER]  Now the particular kind of hubris that 

energizes Google is of course, a sense of techno-fundamentalism.  

The notion that you can always invent something, to solve the 

problem that the last invention created.   And that faith in 

technology, that technology can cover all of our sins and all of 

our faults and fix all of our problems, is again the ultimate 

hubris, it’s the hubris expressed in the myth of Pandora for 

instance, the myth of having too much knowledge.  There are so 

many examples in human history in which techno-

fundamentalism has led to great suffering.  Not that Google is 

about to lead us to great suffering, but they’re still committing 

the sin of hubris.   

 

Now hubris is actually the most serious of the seven deadly sins.  

As Dante explains to us, it was the sin that Lucifer committed.  

Lucifer [WARNING TONE] was a good guy.  Lucifer fell, because 

he thought he could be as effective as God, as good as God, and 

thus, he became Satan.  The very notion of the “Don’t be evil” 

motto, is itself hubristic, is itself, evil, because it is itself a 

violation of the seven deadly sins.   One real-world example, let 

me finish with very quickly, Google Book Search.  Google has 

been trying to scan in 36 million books from libraries around the 

world, in an effort to essentially corner the market on digital book

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 28. 

 

 

 

access, for a number of years.   Early on, four years ago when it 

started this project or got public with this project, it claimed that 

everything was cool as far as copyright was concerned.  In other 

words, copyright only applies to mere mortals, not to 

superhuman supercompanies like Google.  Well, it turns out 

Google wasn’t right about that, last month Google ended up 

having to settle, and wrote a check for $125 million to publishers 

and authors [sic], because it turns out, they weren’t quite as on 

the ball about copyright as they thought.  [WARNING TONE 

REPEATS]  Thank you very much.

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Siva Vaidhyanathan.  Our final speaker against the 

motion, Jeff Jarvis, has had a foot in what we call the legacy

he was also a TV critic for TV Guide and for People.  But of late he

And I guess in both full disclosure and a plug I should say I have 

a book coming out called, What Would Google Do?  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 29. 

 

 

 

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

That’s blasphemy!  

JEFF JARVIS 

You're just jealous.  [LAUGHTER]  Massage would feel good right 

now, wouldn't it?  We should remember where this pledge came 

from.  The chiefs of Google have said that the real purpose of the 

“Don’t Be Evil” pledge is to give employees the license to remind 

their bosses of this in meetings. So, a geek can stand there and 

say, is that evil?  The kind of thing a geek would say.  And it’s, 

it’s useful.  Imagine, ladies and gentleman, if we had that phrase, 

“don’t be evil,” chiseled over every door on Wall Street.  Would we 

not have a better world today?  [APPLAUSE]  In this poisoned 

process that led to the financial crisis, if just one, or two, or five, 

or ten people had said, Hmm… taking poison mortgages, or 

giving them, is that evil?  Creating poison assets and selling 

them, is that evil?  So, I think it’s important to just recognize that 

the rule itself is good.  The fact that Google asks it is good.  And 

we should wish that it shouldn't be special subject of a debate 

that a company promises not to be evil.  The fact that it’s special 

is, itself, a virtue.  So, I would like to match the seven deadly sins 

with eight, I’ll beat you, virtues of Google. [LAUGHTER]  And let’s 

remember that virtue does leaven evil.  We all mess up, right?  So 

virtue matters.  So number one, Google has opened up, as my 

colleagues have said, the world’s knowledge to the world, or 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 30. 

 

 

 

stipulate China, most of the world’s knowledge to most of the 

world.  And that’s important.  It has changed our very view of 

facts and knowledge and accuracy.  No longer do we end an 

argument saying, I don’t know.  We go to Google.  Google will tell 

us. [LAUGHTER]  And it will tell us that in a blink of an eye.  

Now, in fact, I went to Google, and I asked Google how fast does 

an eye blink.  And it told me in point three seconds that an eye 

blinks in point three seconds. [LAUGHTER]  Your life is richer 

now because of Google.  Number two, Google respects the 

wisdom of the crowd.  We are too often not respected.  There’s a 

snobbishness about my old colleagues in big old media.  Google 

doesn't have that.  Google learns what it learns because it trusts 

us.  Isn't that nice?  Shouldn't companies do that?  Shouldn't 

politicians do that?  Wouldn't trust matter?  Google in its very 

essence trusts us.  Number three, Google takes the wisdom of the 

crowd, it knows we have wisdom, and it gives it back to us.  It 

gives us our own knowledge.  Look at the Google flu trends 

search.  It lets us know how often we search for a flu, and how 

the flu trend is coming.  That is our knowledge, not Google’s.  

Google shares our own knowledge with us, it gives it back, it does 

add value, if not flaming cat videos, to our own wisdom.  Google 

connects people.  This is so important.  We often are accused on 

line of being anti-social.  I think we’ve become hyper-social.  I 

think we’re more connected.  I met Esther and Siva because of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 31. 

 

 

 

Google, because of searches.  I looked at Google, and there’s Siva 

on the other side.  And so I think the importance of Google 

connecting people cannot be underestimated.  Our children today 

connect in ways across cultures we don’t even know, yes 

sometimes it makes us nervous, but I think that it can only be 

good.  Admit it, how many of you have searched Google for an old 

girlfriend or boyfriend?  Aw, come on, you liars.  [LAUGHTER]  

Now, part of the problem is, I can say this because I have gray 

hair, that probably, the probability of finding someone is 

inversely proportional to your age.  But young people will stay 

connected to their friends for the rest of their lives.  Imagine the 

impact that will have on friendship and society, and Google is the 

mechanism that makes that happen.  Five, Google creates 

platforms, it is a platform that enables us to create.  A recent poll 

said eighty percent of Americans think they have a book in them.  

We should be glad that most don’t come out.  But we have seen 

in Google that it is an age of creation, and Google creates the 

platforms, the tools to let us create, the means to let us pay for 

that.  I think that’s very, very important.  Six, Google does have 

ads.  Last year I made a big four thousand, five hundred dollars 

on Google ads.  I shouldn't quit the day job, I know.  But, if you 

want to compare, my dear colleagues on the other side, the view 

of Google toward its advertising structure, compare it to a 

monopoly newspaper, which set the price, which set its own 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 32. 

 

 

 

rules, which allowed you to only do so many things with their 

space, well, no, we can do what we want with our ads.  We can 

start whole businesses with it.  We can create movements with it.  

We can be found with it.  That’s important.  And I believe that 

Google ads will help support the future even of news.  Seven, 

Google.org, the foundation started by Google, is supported by one 

percent of the equity, and one percent of the profits of the 

company. And it is trying to solve, with hubris, the problem of 

energy and global warming in one fell swoop.  But I’ve learned 

that they're doing it in a unique techno-smart way, the way 

engineers do.   Engineers solve problems.  We have a problem, 

they're looking for the solution.  Politicians are trying to get us on 

energy with regulation and taxes and prohibitions and slaps on 

the wrist.  Google is giving this investment, and innovation, and 

invention.  And if it can solve the problem of power cheaper than 

coal, then we don’t have to save anymore, we can use as much as 

we want.  Google understands abundance.  Finally, [CHIME]  

eight, Google has a new model on how to treat employees.  We 

get, they get, massages.  Finally, I want to say that Google 

teaches us to understand our new world in new ways.  And if we 

are too critical of Google I think we give up that opportunity to 

see this new world and understand it through the lens of Google.  

In this new economy, I don’t think companies will be built 

anymore by huge capital, making huge acquisitions, they will be

built, as Google has, through networks and platforms.  We have a 

lot to learn from Google.  As we try to understand this new world 

of links and connectedness and platforms and networks and 

generosity and speed, we would do well to ask ourselves, “what 

would Google do?”  Google is not evil.  In the examples it gives, 

and in the fact that it vows not to be evil, Google is a model to us 

all.  Our world is better off because we have Google.  So please, 

have a moment of decency, and vote against the motion.   

[APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you Jeff Jarvis.  That concludes our opening round, and in 

a minute or two I'm going to turn to you and ask whoever is there 

seething to respond to something that you’ve just heard that 

outrages you to do so.  And we will also shortly be turning to 

questions from the audience.  But I want to restate our motion 

that “Google Violates Its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto”  And as you know 

when you came in this evening, we asked you to vote for your 

opinion on this motion.  And we have the numbers now, which 

I'm about to reveal, numbers which will appear on Google in 

perpetuity from this moment forward.  Before the debate, twenty-

one percent of you agreed with the motion, thirty-one percent of 

you were against the motion, and forty-eight percent of you were 

undecided.  And that forty-eight percent is very valuable, it’s one 

of the largest undecided votes we’ve seen so far this season, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 34. 

 

 

 

maybe the largest.  And again, reminding you that this is a 

contest for changing minds, so that forty-eight percent is a very, 

very large pie, to cut up, and we will be asking you to vote a little 

bit later on again in the evening.  But first I want to turn to you, 

and I’ll count to three to see if a hand goes up, if anybody…  Oh, 

OK.  Harry Lewis, for the motion.   

HARRY LEWIS 

I’d just like to point out that our opposition tried both tactics to 

persuade you to vote against the motion.  They said that evil 

means Hitler, Pol Pot, and the worst gulags of the Soviet Union.  

And they’ve also said, they mean by evil something that’s a much 

higher standard.  Now, I would like to think, and I would like to 

ask the opposition if they don’t think that when Google made 

their motion, made their motto, “don’t be evil,” that they were not 

holding them to the standard that they shouldn't be as evil as Pol 

Pot, Hitler, and the worst of the Soviet Union, and if anything 

better than that, they would get a pass on the “don’t be evil” 

motto.  [LAUGHTER]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Jim, Jim Harper?  Jim Harper, take that one.  Jim Harper 

speaking for the motion.   

JIM HARPER 

Now, the question is as to the motto, and I would, I spoke to both 

versions, the actual, genuine meaning of the word evil, but what 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 35. 

 

 

 

they may have meant, which is the sort of corporate greed kind of 

thing.  Greed, which as Siva pointed out, drives them, wrongly 

apparently, to compete with eBay and Microsoft and Amazon, 

that's not an indictment of a company to say that they're 

competing with others, trying to serve consumers better than 

with whom they, than with whom they compete.  By any standard 

Google is not violating the “don’t be evil” policy that they put 

forward.  

JOHN DONVAN  

Jim, your teammate, Esther Dyson.  

ESTHER DYSON 

Yeah, the purpose of this motto is that these guys are smart, and 

they are aware of the possibility of evil, they're aware that their 

extraordinary success and their extraordinary ability to collect 

information gives them a lot of power, and they do not want to 

abuse it.  The other thing I’d like to point out is that Google, 

using Google is voluntary.  Pol Pot, all these dictators, they were 

not voluntary.  Google, whether it wanted to be evil or not, is 

constrained by the forces of competition, and it’s well aware of 

that.  It has to earn your favor.  It discloses to you what it does 

with your information.  You can go and search your web history.  

So there, they're using their power to do good and to make the 

world more transparent.

Siva, you want to jump in?  

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

Yeah, Jim, you’ve fallen into my trap. [LAUGHTER]  

JOHN DONVAN 

So, can you get close to your mic a little bit? 

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

Of course.  So, you’ve fallen into my trap by citing the fact that 

every company should be expected to compete, and should, in 

fact, probably be extravagant, be gluttonous, be greedy, be 

slothful, be wrathful, and be envious, and of course, hubristic.  

Every company should, because that’s what companies should 

do, they should compete, they should win, they should crush…

No, they should win, they should not crush— 

MAN 

Siva, you’ve fallen into your own bog— 

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

And by that, by that I say, it is for the companies to violate the 

seven deadly sins, and not to pretend they don’t, and it is for 

popes and poets to warn us against it.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Randy Picker for, let me bring in Randy Picker for the motion.

RANDAL PICKER 

I hate to be a textualist, but I brought the registration statement 

with me, right, let’s see what it says.  Don’t be evil.  We believe 

strongly that in the long term we will be better served as 

shareholders and in all other ways by a company that does good 

things for the world, even if we forgo some short term gains.  The 

question is, when does Google, faced with a conflict between 

what’s good for the world sacrifice its own interests.  I don’t think 

it’s doing that.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jeff Jarvis?  

JEFF JARVIS 

Let’s look at Yahoo, may it rest in peace.  

JOHN DONVAN 

Yes. [LAUGHTER]   

JEFF JARVIS 

Shall we have a moment of silence for Jerry Yang, dearly 

departed.  

JOHN DONVAN 

Not good radio.  Continue.   

JEFF JARVIS 

Yes.  Yahoo was the last old structure, the last old media 

company.  Google is a new company.  Eric Schmidt was asked 

recently by Jim Kramer how much they could make by putting

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 38. 

 

 

 

ads on their home page.  Some untold billions of dollars, he said.  

They chose not to do that.  Is that good versus evil?  I actually 

argue it is, because Google recognizes that it’s not an end, like 

Yahoo.  It’s not an old media company, it’s a new media company 

that gets us to what we want to get to.  That itself is a virtue.  I 

think the problem we’re having here is defining the fall from 

grace.  And if we all define it the way that you are trying to hold 

Google, then we’re all going to hell, because— 

JOHN DONVAN 

This has been a very theological evening so far.  [LAUGHTER]   

ESTHER DYSON 

That word evil does it.   

JEFF JARVIS 

WWGD.  Um…  And so I think that Google recognizes that life is a 

beta.  Google puts out products and says, they're not done yet.  

They are wrong, they're incomplete, please help us fix them.  

Google is not trying to say that they are ultimately absolutely 

virtuous.  If we all tried to define ourselves that way, we’d be 

doomed.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Siva?   

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

So, Jeff has compared Google to Wall Street firms and said, 

wouldn't it be great if Wall Street firms had that motto chiseled in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 39. 

 

 

 

their buildings.  He’s compared Google to newspapers that have 

local monopolies, and pointed out that newspapers, of course, fix 

prices on advertising.  And now he’s compared Google to Yahoo.  

None of that matters.  It does not matter that any other company 

behaves badly, or behaves in an evil way, because none of those 

companies ever were foolish enough to chisel such a motto into 

their buildings or their financial filing statements.  Now that, the 

fact is— 

JOHN DONVAN 

Should they have?  Should they have?   

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

…that Google has set its own standard, and has not met its own 

standard.  

ESTHER DYSON 

It has set its own standard, and I believe it has met it.  It has 

aspired to do good.  It has, as I said, engaged in an evil world to 

make it better.  To me that’s the opposite of evil.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Harry Lewis, do you think Google actually meant it when it said 

that it wanted to commit no evil, or was that the most cynical 

declaration of all time?   

HARRY LEWIS 

It was an aspirational statement— 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 40. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN 

They meant it?   

HARRY LEWIS 

…and just as many of us make promises that we have to 

acknowledge we are unable to keep, Google has been unable, 

virtuously and continuously, to keep its aspirational promise.  I 

think it’s a good thing that Google made that aspirational 

promise.  The question is whether it ever violates it, and the 

answer is plainly that it does.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Esther, you were talking about China.  Harry says going to 

China, and essentially he’s saying collaborating with the regime, 

and I choose all of those words because that’s exactly what his 

point was, was an act of evil.  And you're arguing that a little 

access is a good thing.  

ESTHER DYSON 

It, no, I'm—a little access is a good thing, but I'm arguing 

something more important.  It’s not collaborating with the regime, 

it is…  It is infiltrating the regime, it is spreading information 

within China, it’s exposing people to the virtues of knowledge.  

It’s changing their expectations.  It’s creating more transparency.  

Long run, you will see that Google is going to change China by 

opening those cracks.  Every time you open a crack and insert 

something in it, it starts to crumble.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 41. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN 

We’re going to hear from your teammate Jeff Jarvis in just a 

moment, because he has something he wants to say.  But at this 

point I’d like to bring the house lights up.  And if you have 

questions, raise your hands, and we have folks with microphones 

circulating.  I know that there are some journalists in the 

audience, and we’re happy to have your questions, we just would 

ask that you’d identify yourselves.   And if some, in some other 

way you have some dog in the fight in a way that you would like 

to disclose, that would be a good thing too.  

ESTHER DYSON 

No, we believe in disclosure regardless.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jeff Jarvis?   

JEFF JARVIS 

Even if you wish that Google did differently in China, and I, 

frankly I do, I wish they’d use their power.  The important thing 

is to realize the basis upon which they made this decision.  And 

they used their “don’t be evil” pledge as a basis to debate and 

decide this.  They made their decision not out of pure greed, but 

out of the belief, agree with it or disagree with it, but out of the 

belief that they were trying to do good.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Let’s go to a question halfway up, and again, passing the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 42. 

 

 

 

microphone down, and reminding you of our disclosure request.   

LAWRENCE LESSIG 

Right, so my name is Larry Lessig, I'm a professor at Stanford, 

and Stanford gets lots of money from Google for some reason, I 

don't know why…  But, first a comment to Siva, and then a 

question for Harry.  The comment for Siva is, it’s not actually true 

to say, Siva, that Google paid a hundred twenty-five million 

dollars for something that it originally claimed it could do for free.  

It paid a hundred and twenty-five million dollars to do something 

far beyond what it originally claimed fair use protected it to do.  

And it explicitly says in the agreement that it does not believe 

that its original fair use claims are false, as I believe its fair use 

claims are true, so what it’s done is just bought a right that 

before it never claimed.  This is not settling.   

JOHN DONVAN  

For people who are unaware of this settlement, could you take 

three sentences to explain— 

LAWRENCE LESSIG 

Long sentences?  [LAUGHTER]  I'm a lawyer, so…   

JOHN DONVAN  

Yeah, but I think you can do it.  We’re, you're talking about the 

publishing— 

LAWRENCE LESSIG 

Right, so Google originally claimed it had the right to scan these 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 43. 

 

 

 

eighteen, or thirty-six million books— 

JOHN DONVAN 

One sentence.   

LAWRENCE LESSIG 

…and at least make available snippets of the books that were still 

in copyright— 

JOHN DONVAN 

Comma— 

LAWRENCE LESSIG 

…but out of print.  Period.  [LAUGHTER]  The settlement gives 

Google the right to display twenty percent of a book, plus, if a 

user chooses, to then give user access to the full book if they pay.  

That is wildly more than anybody thought fair use— 

JOHN DONVAN  

Siva— 

LAWRENCE LESSIG 

…would grant them the right to do— 

JOHN DONVAN 

We’ll come to your second question, I want Siva to respond to 

that, because— 

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

Yeah, I’ll— 

JOHN DONVAN 

…basically, what’s wrong with, especially since a lot of these, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 44. 

 

 

 

millions of books were out of print, you couldn't get to unless you 

traveled halfway across the world to a dusty library, and what 

you can now get online.  

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

I don’t want to argue that, that making this material available is 

an example of evil, what was evil was the hubris in arguing that 

they could fly above the basics of copyright when they do it.  And 

Larry and I have had this argument going on for about four years, 

we don’t want to invite everybody else into it, nonetheless, we— 

JOHN DONVAN  

No, no, no, we do, we— 

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

We’re at, we’re at loggerheads on it.  But I do want to point out 

that of the hundred and twenty-five million dollars that Google 

willfully paid in the settlement, people don’t give away money for 

nothing, they basically were paying the authors and the 

publishers ninety-one million dollars to settle the damages that 

were claimed by the authors and publishers.  Right?  Simple 

math.  No something for nothing.  The extra services that Google 

is now providing will take up thirty-four million dollars of that 

that hundred and twenty-five million.  So, in fact, the settlement 

was a concession that they probably had flown too close to the 

sun— 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 45. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN 

Randy Picker wants to add to that.  

RANDAL PICKER 

Yeah, don’t focus on the dollars, focus on a different issue.  So 

the basic structure of copyright law is, subject to fair use, you 

have to get permission.  Google has done something incredibly 

clever, evil, I don’t know, in the settlement which is, by turning it 

into an opt-out class action, and now I just said a bunch of legal 

words that you're not going to like, they’ve effectively changed the 

default position with regard to how copyright’s consent system 

works.  That’s either brilliant because of the orphan works 

problem, clever, or evil, I don’t know.   

JOHN DONVAN  

But bottom line, for those of us who aren't lawyers and don’t 

know the terms of the debate— 

RANDAL PICKER 

Yeah.  

JOHN DONVAN 

…did, did Google serve its own interests in this deal?   

RANDAL PICKER 

Very much so, I think.  Maybe the public interest at the same 

time—[OVERLAPPING VOICES]  

JOHN DONVAN 

Larry, you have, Larry you had a, from the audience, you had a

question— 

ESTHER DYSON 

They also served the interests of people who want to read books 

that were no longer available, and authors to get payments.  

Thank you.  

[APPLAUSE]  

JOHN DONVAN 

Larry, to your question.   

LAWRENCE LESSIG 

Right, so the question to Harry.  So you observed that your 

reason for calling your daughter’s company evil is that… 

[LAUGHTER]   

HARRY LEWIS 

Thanks a lot, she’ll love you for that.  

LAWRENCE LESSIG 

…is that it complies with the Chinese rules about censoring a 

certain class of speech.  

 

During the political campaign that we’ve just ended, John 

McCain complained to Yahoo, I mean, to YouTube, part of 

Google, that YouTube was complying with American copyright 

laws and censoring a whole bunch of speech that he thought 

should be kept up on the internet.  Now, would you say a 

company is evil when it complies with American law and censors 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 47. 

 

 

 

speech, or is it, or is a company— 

JOHN DONVAN 

OK, we, the question— 

LAWRENCE LESSIG 

 

…obliged to keep all speech available regardless of the local law 

that might control it?  

HARRY LEWIS 

In the case of John McCain, I'm actually with John McCain in 

wishing that YouTube would exercise a little more judgement 

before it automatically pulled the, the campaign videos down, 

although I understand the practical reasons why that’s 

important, and I understand why, under the Safe Haven rules, 

they would have the knee jerk reaction.  But Google actually 

could afford to review some of those videos in the middle of a 

political campaign to make a judgement about whether they were 

fair use or not, and I wish they had.   

MAN 

[OVERLAPPING VOICES] But complying with— 

JOHN DONVAN 

Would the audience agree with that?  Those who agree, just a 

round of applause to that.  [APPLAUSE]  And those who don’t 

agree, those who don’t agree?  [APPLAUSE]  About fifty-fifty.  

We’re going to go to another question up in the, halfway up.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 48. 

 

 

 

Who’s there?  OK, we have one down front, to the, to your left 

here.  And again, I will applaud a very cogent question.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I’ve written it down, actually.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Excellent.  

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Just to…  I'm John [INAUDIBLE], I work for King Features, which 

is an online company.  And I must say, someone brought up the 

point, if you put “don’t be evil” over financial services companies, 

somehow they miraculously think that they're not going to be 

evil.  I think that people that are involved with the mortgage 

industry and the credit default sweeps, I still think to this day 

they probably are doing probably the benefit and the goodness of 

the financial services.  So here’s my question.  If Google is willing 

to limit search to get market share, what would limit them from 

disclosing personal search information of citizens to gain or 

maintain a market share.  

JOHN DONVAN  

Jeff Jarvis.  Great question, when you got to it, by the way.  

[LAUGHTER]   

JEFF JARVIS 

With all respect, I think you're showing little faith in mankind.  

It’s not Google you have a problem with, but man.  Yes, even in a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 49. 

 

 

 

financial organization there can be someone who would ask the 

question, force the issue, is this evil?  And similarly in Google, 

there is not only that, but there is also the self interest that 

Google does have a brand and a reputation.  And if Google 

messes with us, we can use the internet and find ourselves on 

Google to get Google back.  And we will.  So Google, in its 

enlightened self interest, I believe would not mess with us.   

JOHN DONVAN  

OK, just a time check on where we are.  We’re about halfway 

through the head to head discussion.  Just a reminder, I'm John 

Donvan, your host and moderator of this Intelligence Squared US 

Debate where the motion is: “Google Violates Its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ 

Motto.”  “Google Violates Its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto.”  We have three 

debaters for and against, and we are, at this point, taking 

questions from the audience, and we have, yes I see you 

Madame.   

MEGHAN KEANE 

Hi, Meghan Keane with Wired.com.  I'm just wondering about 

Yahoo and Google’s search partnership, and, did efforts to stop 

Google from forming a monopoly just end up speeding up the 

demise of its competitor?  And, if you all have any thoughts on 

who might be able to save Yahoo now that Yang has stepped 

down?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 50. 

 

 

 

RANDAL PICKER 

Yeah, so on the question— 

JOHN DONVAN  

Randy Picker.  

RANDAL PICKER 

On the question of demise, I think that the question is, is 

Microsoft, who wanted to buy Yahoo before, still a natural 

purchaser.  Obviously the scuttlebutt in today’s newspapers and 

online is that the change in management yesterday may increase 

that possibility. So if you ask what the natural deal is, that’s the 

natural deal.  It’s not obvious to me that deal will actually matter.  

Maybe Esther’s in a better position to talk about that, but that 

seems to me the most natural next move for Yahoo.  

ESTHER DYSON 

Yeah, it’s, there are other acquirers, such as AOL, but I think the 

most important thing to learn from this is that companies that 

get into trouble usually are not murdered by Google or anybody 

else, they commit suicide.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Question from the gentleman in the center.  

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I confess to being a father of a daughter who works at Google 

also.  I would like to ask the panel, either side of the question, 

where do the shareholders figure into this?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 51. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN  

Are they evil, are you asking?  

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Pardon?  

JOHN DONVAN 

Are the shareholders evil?   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

[COUGHS]  Well, in a certain sense, yes, I'm asking that question.  

I'm asking what—we’re talking about Google as if it was an 

abstract drawing, OK, when in fact there are these shareholders 

out there, and don’t they have a voice in how the company 

behaves?  Or should they?   

JOHN DONVAN  

Esther?  

ESTHER DYSON 

I think Google feels, and I agree, that shareholders matter, but 

not a lot.  They, if their interests are short term profits, they can 

buy and sell and go away.  What the founders wanted to create 

was a company where they were not driven by short term 

shareholder considerations.  So, they're driven to some extent by 

long term shareholder considerations.  They don’t want to sell 

their shares, they want this thing to be worth a lot in the long 

run, and I would say that's the basic attitude.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 52. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN  

But Harry Lewis, I think you are almost arguing, in your China 

argument, that you're disappointed that shareholders did not 

protest.   

HARRY LEWIS 

Oh, I think, yes, I think that Google’s international reputation 

would have soared had they stood firmly against the Chinese 

censorship.  It would have been in their long term interests, as 

many of the other measures that Google has made had.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Jim Harper?  

JIM HARPER 

As a shareholder question, this is very much like the question of 

people who complain about Google but don’t do anything about 

it.  Shareholders are free to sell, and they would if Google was 

evil, if they were violating their motto.   

ESTHER DYSON 

Unfortunately, they wouldn't actually— 

JIM HARPER 

Shareholders hold.  [LAUGHTER]   

JOHN DONVAN 

Esther, I don’t think your mic was on, could you make— 

ESTHER DYSON 

Yeah, I know.  I don’t, unfortunately, I don’t think the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 53. 

 

 

 

shareholders would have sold if they thought Google was evil.  

JIM HARPER 

They're free to.   

ESTHER DYSON 

They're free to.  I also don’t think they would have applauded had 

Google stayed out of China.  They probably would not have 

noticed, to be candid.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Siva?  

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

Someone’s been selling Google’s shares— 

ESTHER DYSON 

They’ve been selling everybody’s— 

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

Well, exactly.  But people have been selling Google shares for 

reasons they don't disclose. Right?  It’s a simple signal they send 

to the market.  Nonetheless, remember that a publicly traded 

company that’s doing very well can afford to hold out a motto like 

“Don’t be evil.”  When things get tough, and as Harry’s brought 

up, they have to make a decision between revenue and 

egalitarianism, they're going to pick revenue, as they have every 

time.   

JOHN DONVAN  

We’re going to another question, halfway up, gentleman in the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 54. 

 

 

 

white shirt.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Yes, hi.  I have no relationship with Google.  Other than being a, 

a Google user at times.  So I, I wanted to just raise one point to 

the against side, that I have kind of a problem with the fact that, 

you know, you're, basically you seem, Esther, I believe, Esther, I 

believe, made the point that Google aspires to, to embrace, or to, 

to live up to this motto.   But I kind of feel like you're conflating 

aspiration with accomplishment.  And I also feel like Jeff, you’ve 

kind of made the point that, well, just because Google has done, 

eight, or nine, or ten, or twenty good things, that that somehow 

would eliminate if they had done anything bad.  But the question 

is, did they violate the motto, which means that they commit 

actions that are, that are evil, or acts of evil.   

JOHN DONVAN  

All right.  

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

The point that, you know, the law professor here in the audience 

raised, of the fact that Google is adhering to, to legal norms in 

whatever market they belong to, raises the, the profound problem 

for me that Google itself has said that they aspire to be able to 

predict what we want to do before we know it ourselves.  And, 

with the accumulation of so much information from people, 

which is not opted in, what if the, the government in some other 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 55. 

 

 

 

place were to decide that Google needed to share that information 

with people— 

JOHN DONVAN  

I'm going to stop you there— 

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

…or with the government itself?  

JOHN DONVAN 

…and thank you for the question.  And there were a few 

questions there, but Jeff, you had more of a challenge to your 

view than question, so— 

JEFF JARVIS 

On the aspirational point, I think that your standard, then, is 

perfection.  It is, in fact, God-like.  Because what you're saying is 

that if you fail at anything beyond this pledge of being evil, you’ve 

somehow failed.  And I don’t think anyone here in reasonable 

mind would hold any of us here, or Google, or anyone short of 

God, to that.  And so, I also think that it’s important that, that 

your other issue is that, is this God-Google omniscient, does it 

know everything about us, and can that be tapped by someone 

else?  I think it’s a mistake to say, similarly, the opposite of the 

aspirational question, if that could happen, it, ergo, is true.  If 

Google could do bad, ergo it is bad.  Or Google is big, and big is 

often bad, ergo Google is bad.  None of that follows.

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 56. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN  

OK, and just for our radio audience, I just want to say, Jeff Jarvis 

answering that question.  Esther Dyson?   

ESTHER DYSON 

Yeah, just briefly I want to respond to one thing you said, and 

point out the real danger here is not Google, it’s the government.  

And governments have power which can easily be abused.  

Google is constrained.  It’s constrained by law, it’s constrained by 

competition, it’s constrained by its users, and it responds to 

those constraints, and that’s one reason it’s not able.  But I think 

the other reason is, it doesn't want to be.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Siva, can you be brief on this, because there is a question— 

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

Very brief.  I actually want to echo what Esther said, and again, 

just because there are more evil institutions in the world than 

Google does not mean that our case, that they violated their 

motto, is not true.  Right?  The fact that the federal government is 

much more evil does not absolve Google of responsibility of 

maintaining information that can be easily, secretly gathered.   

Right?  If the FBI comes with a national security letter to Google 

and says, we want to know everything about Randy Picker, 

Randy Picker will never know that that happens, and no one at 

Google can talk about the fact that it happens.  Right?  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 57. 

 

 

 

That’s the black box we’re dealing with.  Google is a black box, 

the federal government is a black box.  The interaction of two 

black boxes are, is a serious danger.  That doesn't mean Google 

has done anything specifically, actively evil, but it certainly has 

enabled the potential of real evil.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Question all the way in the back.   

KEVIN WILLIAMSON 

Hi, Kevin Williamson, National Review, which may explain the 

slightly Thomistic [PH] tenor of this question, but this is really for 

those who are arguing for the motion, aren't you arguing that 

Google is in fact violating a different motto, which would say 

“don’t do evil,” versus a motto that says “don’t be evil.”  Every 

business makes some sort of compromise, every business makes 

a mistake.  Everybody who’s ever paid a dollar in taxes has made 

a compromise with evil at some point.  But… [LAUGHTER]   

JOHN DONVAN  

It’s staying theological, and it was a great question.  Harry Lewis 

for the motion— 

KEVIN WILLIAMSON 

[OVERLAPPING VOICES]  Aren't you arguing against a different 

motto— 

HARRY LEWIS 

I was waiting for this Clintonian, or Clinton-esque moment where

the debate turned to the question of what the meaning of “be” is.  

[LAUGHTER]  [PAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Are you going to take that question?  [LAUGHTER] I'm sorry, I 

was briefly distracted, I thought you were on a roll.   

HARRY LEWIS 

No, I was, I— 

MAN 

You were done.  

HARRY LEWIS 

I was, my answer is really done— 

JOHN DONVAN  

No, no, I actually think there’s something to the question.   

HARRY LEWIS 

I,— 

JIM HARPER 

The question, the question calls for an assessment of the totality 

of the company, not picking out individual instances where you 

don’t like what Google does, and we’ve made cases that there are 

many, many of those are, are falsities.  The totality of, the 

company invited this discussion, first of all, by having this motto, 

and now exposes itself to this kind of discussion.  And I think it 

holds up well, given all that.

If being evil means being evil in your heart, and they—

JOHN DONVAN 

Question down front.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

I’m Vinnie Mankovsky [PH], I don’t have anything to do with 

Google, but I have two questions, one for Harry Lewis, the other 

is for Siva.  

JOHN DONVAN 

I'm going to ask you to choose one, OK?   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

  

Oh, that’s difficult, let’s go with the China one.  Having lived for 

twenty years under communism in Bulgaria, and having been 

listening to the Voice of America and Free Europe, which were 

broadcasted by the US mainly, and were, noised by the Bulgarian 

authorities as well as the Russian and everyone else in the east 

bloc, according to what you say, the US should not have actually 

radio transmitted Voice of America because our authorities were 

actually, making noise on the same frequency.  But I can tell you, 

if we didn't have access to this little information, we today would 

not have been members of NATO or the European Union.  So how 

would you— 

HARRY LEWIS 

No, no, they, there isn't a parallel between the United States 

Voice of America and Google.  Google is a business, and that, the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 61. 

 

 

 

issue for Google only came up because they wanted to set up 

shop inside China, have employees there, run their servers there, 

and do business with, inside China, and there are rules inside 

China for how businesses have to operate.  And if I can just 

respond to Professor Lessig’s statement, I agree that businesses 

doing business in a country have to obey the laws of the country 

they're doing business in.  And my contention is that Google 

made the wrong decision in deciding to do business in a country 

whose demands were so inconsistent with their fundamental 

mission in life.   

JIM HARPER 

So there’s more evidence to how freedom breaks out in a country 

that I think people should consider.  In Czechoslovakia, Vaclav 

Havel was a playwright, and he wrote very obscure plays that the 

authorities didn't understand well.  But the fact that people went 

to the plays, they talked about them, they were talking about 

revolution, they were talking about freedom.  Similar things are 

happening now with Google’s help in China.  They're using 

cultural references that the authorities don’t understand, and 

that Google and nobody else can control.  They're using language, 

they're talking to each other, they're communicating with each 

other, and they're finding each other through Google.  I'm not 

concerned about the— 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 62. 

 

 

 

HARRY LEWIS 

Well, if I can just add— 

JOHN DONVAN 

We have a— 

HARRY LEWIS 

Just to be clear, Google is not actually the major search engine 

that’s actually used in China, so there are other avenues.   

JOHN DONVAN  

I want to go to, in the little bit of time we have left, get in two 

more questions, up in the far right.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

One of my questions about China was just addressed.  The other 

question was about the Google Chrome browser, which allows it 

to collect personal advertising information.  I was wondering how 

both sides of the motion felt that it could use this as a force for 

good or for evil.   

JOHN DONVAN  

The collection of personal information?   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

Yes, through the browser.  

JOHN DONVAN 

Is there, Esther, a good use of the collection of personal 

information?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 63. 

 

 

 

ESTHER DYSON 

Sure, it can, if a user wants this information, it can be extremely 

valuable for the user.  The user may want to share that 

information with other people.  People keep talking as if users’ 

information was most, ought to be secret.  People are now going 

on line voluntarily sharing it.  They love comparing themselves.  

They like to compare their music tastes, they like to know 

whether they're hot or not.  I like to compare… [LAUGHTER] 

…my genome with other people’s genomes.  And the ability to 

know more about yourself, to share it with other people, that’s 

what mirrors are for, and they're best sellers.   

JOHN DONVAN  

I’ll show you my genome if you show me yours?  [LAUGHTER]  

Siva?  

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

The issue behind privacy and the regulation of personal 

information is not that people should or should not, or do or do 

not want to share.  The issue is a matter of personal autonomy.  

Having the easy to access controls over who sees what in what 

context.  And it’s a much more fluid complicated and multi-

faceted question that simply the idea that we are putting our 

favorite music up on Facebook in large, in torrents.  That's true, 

but it’s not relevant.  The fact is, Chrome and Gmail offer us no 

way to manage our personal information.  Google service— 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 64. 

 

 

 

ESTHER DYSON 

You don't need— 

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

…harvest their, that information, and people use Chrome and 

Gmail without any real knowledge or recognition or simple 

acknowledgement of the transaction.  Most people who use 

Google do not understand the transaction in which they are 

engaging.  And that is a problem.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Our last question, from right down front.  Make it a doozy.  

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I’d like some clarity on the definition of evil that we’re using.  If 

an entity has a good goal and achieves them imperfectly, in such 

that some bad is caused by the imperfect achievement of those 

goals, is that evil?  I don't see anything evil in spoiling your 

employees or in choosing to place some value on an ad-free 

search result such that it costs more for the advertisers.  I 

potentially see evil in the decision to censor the results in China, 

if that was a decision made for the goal of, of financial return.   

JOHN DONVAN  

But at bottom you're asking what?  

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Do we have any way of knowing what Google’s goals are in 

making these decisions, and if we don’t, do we have any way of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 65. 

 

 

 

evaluation whether or not they're evil.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Siva?  

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

Oh, we each have the capacity of judging whether any particular 

action is evil.  I, of course, am appealing to authority, one of the 

classic fallacies, the authority being Dante and Pope Gregory.  

But, I didn't mean to do so quite so facetiously.  I do mean to say 

that all of the things that big, successful corporations should do 

tend to trample on the cannon of good and evil that we have been 

swimming in.  And in fact, it’s hypocritical for a company to say 

that it will hold itself to a high standard.  It’s perfectly reasonable 

for Google to do almost everything it has done as a profit making 

venture, uh, and I applaud most of what it’s done.  But the real 

question is, is this standard itself being undermined by its very 

actions?  Is the fact that it set this high standard for itself 

ultimately foolish?   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you very much, and that includes the head to head 

portion of the discussion, and thanks for your terrific questions, 

which, which actually were quite good questions, and kept things 

moving along.  We’re going to move along now to final statements.  

This is the last chance that each of the panelists will have, really, 

to lock you in.  They’ll each get two minutes to speak.  But before 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 66. 

 

 

 

we do that, I want to remind you of where we were in terms of the 

numbers.  Before the debate, when we polled you on the motion 

that Google violates its “don’t be evil” motto, twenty-one percent 

of you were for the motion, thirty-one percent were against, and a 

very large forty-eight percent were undecided.  So, we’re moving 

forward now to closing statements.  Each panelist will have two 

minutes.  And we are going to begin with Jim Harper, who is the 

director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, 

speaking against the motion.  Jim?  

JIM HARPER 

Well, first I want to congratulate and thank our opponents in this 

debate, they have a very, very difficult chore ahead of them.  

[LAUGHTER]  They did the best they could, and I congratulate 

them on what meager success they had in, in their arguments.  

[LAUGHTER]  Important point, Google invited this conversation.  

Google deserves your credit for having this conversation.  And as 

Jeff pointed out, inviting this conversation internally as well.  

There is a culture there that is essentially good.  There are 

decisions they have made that I have openly criticized.  I disagree 

with some of the things Google does.  The totality of what Google 

does, and the totality of what Google is, is not evil.  It is good.  

And I think you should support opposing the motion…  You 

should oppose the motion… [LAUGHTER]  Because Google is, at 

its heart, a good company that provides extraordinary services to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 67. 

 

 

 

the public, and makes extraordinary amounts of information 

available to the public, and is working around the world to make 

information available.  And the slights that have been heaped 

upon it by our opponents do not overcome their burden, we 

think, and we hope you think, that Google is a good company.  

Please oppose the motion.  

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you Jim Harper.  And making his summarizing statement 

for the motion, Randy Picker, professor at the University of 

Chicago Law School.  Randy Picker?   

RANDAL PICKER 

Well, I'm both a lawyer and an economist.  And as an economist I 

think the issue before us is what I’ll call marginal evil, 

incremental evil.  I think that’s where we are with regard to 

Google.  That’s the question.  When are they creating evil that 

they don't need to create?  When are they making a choice that 

we should understand to be one that benefits Google and hurts 

the market, hurts other participants in that market.  Where I 

started was something that went to the heart of their business 

model.  This isn't a side show, this is not an experiment, this is at 

the heart of the way Google does business.  And what they are 

doing there is doing exactly what we see monopolists doing.  

Since the Sherman Act was passed in 1890, they exercise market 

power.  That’s what Google is doing.  We heard a lot of 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 68. 

 

 

 

discussion, I haven't heard, actually, anything about that.  I 

think that’s because it’s not possible to refute that, and I don’t 

think it’s actually transparent to most people how they're doing 

it.  And when someone asks Google whether they're doing that, 

Google says, we’re running auctions, we don’t have power, 

notwithstanding our market share is sixty-five percent in the 

United States.  That is acting in a way that is being evil.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Randal Picker.  Summarizing against the motion, 

Esther Dyson, an investor in information technologies companies.  

Esther Dyson?   

ESTHER DYSON 

Thank you.  The thing doesn't say don’t be incrementally evil.  I, 

you know, when you have to sort of get down to these fine 

distinctions I think it’s clear you're losing.  So, I would encourage 

you guys… [LAUGHTER] …to join the winning side, and vote 

against this unsupportable proposition.  Google is not violating 

its don’t be evil motto.  They are doing good.  They are opening 

up the world, they are giving people more choices, they're giving 

people awareness of their choices, they're increasing 

transparency and people’s personal autonomy.  Mostly what they 

are doing, and the thing for which I give them most credit is, 

they're eroding the power and limiting the ability of those in 

power to abuse that power by shining light, and by encouraging 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 69. 

 

 

 

people to change their expectations, to start asking for answers.  

They're giving everybody the ability to watch the watchers in this 

increasingly transparent world.  So, please join us, the winning 

side, and vote no.  

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Esther Dyson.  Summarizing his position for the 

motion, Harry Lewis, Professor of Computer Science at Harvard 

University.    

HARRY LEWIS 

Well, not everyone, Esther, they’re not giving that power to 

everyone.  “Evil” was Google’s term, we didn’t set the terms of this 

debate, the Intelligence Squared people didn’t set the terms of 

this debate.  Google set the terms of this debate, by putting that 

grand proposition out there.  “Don’t be evil.”   Some of the things 

they’re doing, they themselves know aren’t right.  They 

themselves would prefer not to be censoring search results in 

China, and they have allied themselves with other corporations 

into a new consortium that is—   And they’ve pledged themselves 

to try to lift this restriction, over the coming years.  Now, they’re 

to be respected for that, as they are to be respected for all of the 

other enlightening things that the other side keeps pointing out 

they are doing.   But it’s not a proposition about on aggregate, are 

they 10 percent more good than they are evil.  The question is, do 

they violate—“violate” is an active verb, that’s a—we won’t—okay, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 70. 

 

 

 

let’s not parse.  [LAUGHTER]  Do they violate their “Don’t be evil” 

motto and I just repeat that the construction of censorship tools 

is an act of evil.  Thank you.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, the motion in this Intelligence Squared US debate is, 

“Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto,” and summarizing his 

position against the motion is Jeff Jarvis, Director of the 

Interactive Journalism program at the City University of New 

York’s Graduate School of Journalism.  Jeff Jarvis.   

JEFF JARVIS 

This debate, I believe, is not about Google, it is about us.  And it 

is perhaps a bit of an indictment of us.  You know, the problem 

we have in America is that we love and nurture success until you 

become too successful.  And when you become too successful we 

become suspicious of you, we even wonder whether you couldn’t 

do this any other way besides being…evil.   Perhaps you do it by 

being smart, by being good, by being generous.  By being 

innovative.  I think that’s what Google has done here, those are 

all virtues, and our risk, as a nation, by looking the gift geek in 

the mouth…  [LAUGHTER]  not a pleasant visual I’ll admit—  

[LAUGHTER]  …is that we lose this lesson and we lose this value 

and we lose this tremendous gift, that Google gives us.  Finally, 

because I am a fan of Google, I am a fan of the wisdom of the 

crowd.  I believe, you are wise.  [LAUGHTER]  So I am confident, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 71. 

 

 

 

that you will vote against the motion.    

JOHN DONVAN  

[LAUGHS]  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, and finally, summarizing his 

position, for the motion, Siva Vaidhyanathan, Associate Professor 

of Media Studies and Law at the University of Virginia, Siva.   

SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN 

Lucifer did not fall because he wanted to be bad.  Like Jessica 

Rabbit he was drawn that way.  [LAUGHTER]  in fact he fell…  

[LAUGHTER]  He fell because he was trying to be great.  Now, I 

firmly believe that companies should be companies.  That 

governments should be governments.   That saints should be 

saints, that sinners should be sinners, that gods should be gods, 

and devils should be devils.  The claims of corporate 

responsibility are basically, cyclical marketing ploys, disguised, 

disguised as something great and good.   The fact is Google grew 

as big and successful as it has, not only because it is great, and 

it is…but because it claimed to be good.  Google never bought a 

Super Bowl ad, to my knowledge, Google never bought an ad.  

Right?    

 

Google got big because in the early days, a whole lot of us who 

were very active on the web were disgusted by the status quo and 

we gravitated to Google not only because it seemed to satisfy our 

needs, but because it satisfied our need to avoid evil and the evil 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” (11/18/08) Page 72. 

 

 

 

in those days was number one, Microsoft, and number two, 

Yahoo.   And in both cases, Google was able to get—gain our 

loyalty.  It was a cynical marketing ploy, one that in the long run, 

it will not and in fact has not lived up to.  People really believed it 

was not evil, many people still believe it does not do evil.  The fact 

is companies should make money, and the rest of us should 

beware.  So please vote for the proposition.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Siva Vaidhyanathan, and I’d just like to ask for a 

round of applause as we conclude the talking portion of the 

debate.  [APPLAUSE]  So now we come to the moment where you 

decide how this all turns out, we are going to ask you to vote on 

the motion which I will restate once again.  “Google Violates its 

‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto.”  Turn to the keypads by your side, if you 

agree with the motion…push number 1, if you disagree number 

2, if you remain undecided, push number 3, and we’re gonna 

have the results actually hurried down in just a moment and as 

they’re tallied, I would like to point out a few things that are 

coming up on Intelligence Squared.  [VOICES, APPLAUSE]

percent were against, and 48 percent were undecided.  After the 

debate, 47 percent of you agree with the motion.  [LAUGHTER, 

APPLAUSE]  47 percent of you are against the motion, and 6 

percent were undecided.  47 percent to 47 percent looks like a 

tie, however, the side that changed most minds is the side for the 

motion, who moved 26 percent of you.  Versus...  [APPLAUSE]   

Versus 16 percent for the side against.  Thank you to our 

panelists and thank all of you for joining us.
