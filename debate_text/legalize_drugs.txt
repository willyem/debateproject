And I also, at this point, would like to bring to the stage, to frame the debate, the man

Foundation, Robert Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Hi, John. 
 
John Donvan: 
Hi, Bob.  And what Robert does -- what Bob does is he frames for us, just in a couple of 
minutes, what the stakes are in this debate and what's -- what are -- the validity of the 
arguments on both sides.  So let's start, Bob, just by asking why this debate now? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, it's very timely because, of course, Colorado and Washington have just passed 
referenda legalizing the recreational use of marijuana.  Now, this topic is broader than 
marijuana.  This is about all kinds of recreational drugs.  But it's timely for that reason, 
and it's also timely because in recent years, both the left and the right have coalesced 
around the pro motion position.

John Donvan: 
And the side arguing for the motion to legal lies drugs, how strong an argument do they 
have? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I think their best argument is that current policy has failed.  And we'd be better off 
placing reliance on treatment, on rehabilitation, on education.  That the costs of 
creating a criminal industry are huge, not only the obvious costs of enforcement, of 
prison, but we create a situation in which the leading role models in inner city 
communities are drug dealers in which a disproportionate number of black youth 
languish away in prisons. 
 
John Donvan: 
And the team arguing against the motion, what's their best argument? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I think their best argument is simply that the consequences of drug use are so 
severe that the government can't simply leave this is a matter of individual choice.  In 
many cases, kids get hooked on drugs well before they reach the age of being able to 
make reasoned choices.  And it's just simply not a matter where you can have a 
libertarian idea that this is -- that this is individual, because it affects so much else in 
society. 
 
18:51:09 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  So there we see it framed, the debate in front of us.  And let's bring our 
debaters to the stage.  Thank you, Bob Rosenkranz. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  And I just want to invite one more round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz for 
making this possible. 
 
[applause] 
 
We call it a war, and for 41 years, we have been fighting it, a war on drugs.  The 
estimated costs so far, about 2.5 trillion dollars.

The results so far, mixed.  So what does it say that voters in Colorado and Washington 
state recently went to the ballot box and decided to legalize one of the drugs we've 
been fighting all of these years, weed, pot, marijuana.  What is that, is it treason, or is it 
a facing up to a certain social reality?  Is this war worth continuing to fight on?  And if so, 
what direction do we take it in?  Those are a lot of questions.  But they all boil down to 
the one that we're going to be debating here tonight.  And here it is:  Yes or no to this 
statement, legalize drugs.  That is the motion on the table.  A debate from Intelligence 
Squared U.S.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four superbly qualified debaters who will be 
arguing for and against it, legalize drugs.  We go in three rounds.  Then the audience 
votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins.  Meeting our debaters, on the side 
arguing for the motion, legalize drugs, Paul Butler, professor of law at Georgetown and 
former federal prosecutor.

Our motion is "Legalize drugs."  Let's talk with our debaters as they come to the stage.  
Paul Butler, you are a Georgetown law professor.  You are arguing for the motion, 
"Legalize drugs."  After Harvard Law you clerked for a judge.  You worked in corporate 
law.

You then became a federal prosecutor and worked for the Department of Justice. But 
then something happened that made you give it all up, and it changed the way you 
thought about the criminal justice system.  What was that? 
 
Paul Butler: 
So somebody forgot to tell the police about all those credentials.  And I got arrested for 
a crime I didn't commit.  It was when I had the most high profile case as a prosecutor, I 
was prosecuting a U.S. senator, and, again, I got locked up.  You can read all about it in 
the first chapter of my book, "Let's Get Free, a Hip-Hop Theory of Justice."

John Donvan: 
Commercials allowed.  And your partner is?

Nick, you are editor-in-chief of the Libertarian Reason.com  and Reason TV? 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
I'm guilty. 
 
John Donvan: 
You have talked about the fact that you have used both legal and illegal drugs 
recreationally.  Interestingly, you once lived on a street called "Stoner Avenue." 
 
[laughter] 
 
You did not use illegal drugs while living there, which ruins the story a little bit.  But 
what is your take seriously on recreational drug use?  Is there a danger involved in 
them? 
 
18:55:06 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
I'd say the only danger is that oftentimes you run out.

[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Our motion, "Legalize drugs," and the team arguing against the motion, first, ladies and 
gentlemen, Theodore Dalrymple. 
 
[applause] 
 
Theodore Dalrymple is your pen name.  We'll say this just once.  Your real name is 
Anthony Daniels, for people who like the specificity.  You are a writer, a former prison 
doctor.  You -- in prison you specialized in cases involving drug offenders, and you came 
away from that experience thinking that we have the relationship between crime and 
drugs wrong.  In what way, Theodore? 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Well, I'm going to say that we've got the relationship exactly the wrong way around. 
 But it's always tempting for people to ascribe human misbehavior to an external factor 
when actually it's internal.  So I don't believe in the causative relationship between 
drugs and crime and bad behavior, actually. 
 
18:56:11 
 
John Donvan: 
And your partner is? 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Asa Hutchinson. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Asa Hutchinson. 
 
[applause] 
 
Asa Hutchinson, you are a former administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration.  You were also a long term member of Congress.  You had served two 
terms.  You had just been elected for the third time when President Bush tapped you to 
go to the DEA.  Why'd you make the choice to do that? 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
How do you say no to the president when he asks you to do something? 
 
[laughter]

You try to say yes.  Jokingly, but seriously, what a great agency.  And I wanted to bring 
not just enforcement efforts to DEA but also demand reduction efforts and cooperation 
with the rehabilitation community. 
 
18:56:54 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, ladies and gentlemen, our four debaters. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is "Legalize drugs," and before the debate begins and again after the debate 
we're going to ask you to vote.  That's two votes.  And the team that has moved its 
numbers, changed most of your minds in the course of the debate, between those two 
votes, will be declared our winner.  So let's go to the first round of voting now.  Our 
motion is legalize drugs.  If coming in off the street you agree with this motion, push 
number one.  If you disagree, push number two.  And if you're undecided, push number 
three.  You can ignore the other keys.  And you can correct a mis-keying.  It'll lock in 
your last vote.  Anyone need more time or want to admit needing more time? 
 
[laughter] 
 
It's pretty straightforward.  All right.  So once again, we're going to hold the results of 
that vote till the end of the debate, until you've heard all of the arguments, all three 
rounds, and then the team that has moved its numbers the most after the second vote 
will be declared our winner. 
 
18:58:06 
 
So on to round one, opening statements from each debater in turn, they will be seven 
minutes, each.  Our motion is "Legalize drugs," and here to speak first for the motion, 
Paul Butler.  He is a professor of law at Georgetown, a former federal prosecutor, and 
one of the nation's most frequently consulted scholars on race and criminal justice.  
Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Butler. 
 
[applause] 
 
Paul Butler: 
Thank you.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  My name is Paul Butler, and I 
represent the people.  When I was a prosecutor, that's how I would start my opening 
statements.  I put a lot of people in prison; I was a soldier in the war on drugs, and 
tonight I'm going to give you a soldier's perspective on why that war is a colossal failure.

Later, Nick will talk about how the war on drugs has compromised our democracy and 
made us all less free.  And he'll also talk about what legal regulation of drugs would look 
like.  Will you be able to go into Whole Foods and buy cocaine?  Nick will tell you about 
the experiences of countries all over the world that have safely legalized drugs.  As a 
prosecutor, I learned that as many people as I locked up, we weren't making a dent in 
the drug trade; we were actually making neighborhoods less safe.  I was prosecuting a 
lot of 19- and 20-year-olds for nonviolent drug offenses.  Locking up these young people 
with a bunch of hardcore rapists and murderers was like sending them to finishing 
school for criminals.  When these kids came home, they had learned how to be really 
good bad guys.  If we legalize drugs, we will stop the counter-productive practice of 
treating kids the same that we treat violent criminals, and we would all be safer.   
 
18:59:58 
 
Maybe my work as a prosecutor would've been worth the enormous social cost if it was 
getting drugs off the street, but we all know the war on drugs doesn't do that.  No 
country has ever found a way to prevent people from using drugs.  
 
The United States locks up more people than any country in the history of the world. 
 We have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners.  It 
costs us billions of dollars that we just cannot afford, and it's just as easy to get drugs 
now as it always has been. 
 
What about drug addicts?  It turns out that the small percentage of people who use 
drugs who become addicts, we know that treatment is a more effective solution than 
punishment for those people.  Most of us are lucky, we don't have a crack head or a 
meth addict in our family, but everybody's got an alcoholic in the family; tobacco might 
be a close second, but I think we all agree that alcohol is probably the worst drug, right? 
 
19:01:01 
 
If you think of it in terms of dysfunctional families, laws, economic productivity, health 
problems, the people who commit crimes under the influence.  But is the answer to 
make using alcohol a crime?  Of course not.  We tried that during Prohibition and it just 
did not work.  All we did was create this illegal, violent market for liquor just like for 
other drugs now, and we didn't stop anybody who wanted to, from drinking, just like we 
don't stop anybody now from using drugs.  
 
So I'm speaking based on my research as a law professor, my work as a prosecutor, and 
also, my life experience.  Ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of hypocrisy in the war on 
drugs, but I want to respect you enough to keep it real.  Like most Americans, I have 
used illegal drugs.  I wasn't introduced to them at my all-black public elementary school 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 -

in Chicago, and at my Catholic high school, a lot more kids drink than smoke weed.  The 
first time I was around a lot of people who used drugs was actually at Yale, where I went 
to college. 
 
19:02:09 

 
[laughter] 
 
And then at Harvard, where I went to law school.  I'm glad I never got caught when I 
smoked pot, and I'm also glad that Barack Obama was not arrested and prosecuted for 
any of the times that he used cocaine and marijuana.  My opponents are honorable 
men, and it makes me wonder if they really practice what they preach.  As you listen to 
the good doctor Theodore, here's one thing you should keep in mind.  He has actually 
prescribed heroin to addicts.  He did it because he knows that addicts need to be 
treated, not punished.  As a practicing physician, he understood that drug dependency is 
a medical issue, not a crime.  And I read a profile of Mr. Hutchinson and he's a 
wonderful family man; I had the pleasure of meeting his wife, Susan.  And I wonder 
what a father, a great father like Mr. Hutchinson would say if one his children called and 
said she was using cocaine. 
 
19:03:03 
 
Would he really say, "Wait a minute, honey," and whisper to his wife, "Quick, dial 911, 
tell the police they need to arrest out daughter; she needs to be prosecuted and locked 
up."  Of course not, none of us would do that to our family or friends.  
 
So my final point, ladies and gentlemen, is, respectfully, what is good enough for our 
children and our friends is good enough for African-Americans.  We call it a war on drugs 
but it's mainly a war on black people; they're the people who get stopped and frisked. 
 Last year in New York City, 50,000 people got arrested for marijuana possession, 
50,000, almost 90 percent were black or Latino.  That's not who really uses drugs.  The 
National Institute of Health tells us that black people don't use drugs more than any 
other group.  They're about 12 percent of drug users. 
 
19:03:55 
 
What about sellers?  Most drug buyers report buying from someone of their own race. 
 White kids in Scarsdale, they don’t have to go to the hood to buy.  They get their weed 
and Ecstasy and Adderall from other white skids in Scarsdale.  But who gets locked up 
for drug crimes?  Almost two-thirds are black, 12 percent of people who do the crime, 
60 percent of people who do the time.  And that's selective prosecution, and it's 
devastated the African-American community.  We have one black president and one 
million black people in prison.  The book "The New Jim Crow" tells us that because of 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

the war on drugs there are more African-Americans under criminal justice supervision 
now than there were slaves in 1850.  Think about the catastrophic effect that has on 
families.  In the black community, we have a lot of women and children who are doing 
time on the outside.   
 
19:04:59 
 
So, again, the most responsible way to deal with the problems of illegal drug use is to 
not punish people for using drugs.  The reality is, for my opponents, this will never -- this 
is just a nice rhetorical debate.  The odds are that their children will use drugs, and they 
will never be touched by the criminal justice system.  The odds for African-American 
children are very different.  And that just seems profoundly unfair.  My friends, as a 
civilized society, we shouldn't punish people for being sick.  We shouldn't put anybody 
in a cage based on what they put in their mouths.  There's a better way.  It's to legalize 
drugs. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you.  Paul Butler. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Our motion is "Legalize Drugs."  And now here to speak against the motion, Asa 
Hutchinson.  He is the CEO of the Hutchinson Group and a former congressman.  He has 
served as administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration and as the first 
undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security.  Ladies and gentlemen, Asa 
Hutchinson. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:06:13 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Thank you.  What an exciting evening to debate an important subject for our country 
and for our future.  Paul, great job in your opening remarks.  An African-American who 
also happens to be in a leadership position in the United States attended the summit of 
the Americas in Colombia, South America.  He said it is okay for us to debate the pros 
and cons of the war on drugs.  But, quote, "I personally, in my administration, position is 
that legalization is not the answer," end quote.  That was President Barack Obama.  I 
happen to agree with President Barack Obama.

I agree that there are changes that need to be made as we look at how we enforce our 
laws.  I agree that we need to have a robust debate about incarceration policies and 
what we are doing in our fight against illegal drugs and how much we're devoting to 
rehabilitation.  All of those issues are appropriate to be on the table.  So there needs to 
be changes.  Paul mentioned that we need to reduce racial disparities in enforcement.  
That's why I have worked very hard to reduce the cocaine, the crack, and powder 
cocaine disparity that impacts racially across America.  We've reduced that disparity. 
 We've made a correction to the system.  We need to reduce our incarceration rates. 
 That's why I'm engaged on the Right on Crime initiative and initiatives that encourage 
our state legislatures to look at incarceration policies.  And in Texas and in Arkansas and 
in South Carolina, they have reduced the incarceration rates for drug offenders, both to 
save money, but also to reexamine our policies. 
 
19:08:07 
 
I believe we need to improve alternatives to incarceration.  That's why I've been a 
supporter of drug treatment courts that provide accountability with treatment so that it 
can be an effective treatment, and it has a great success story across America.  So why -- 
why did the president take the position that legalization is not the answer?  Perhaps he 
understood the success that we have achieved whenever we look at the fact that drug 
use has been cut in half over the last 30 years in our country.  Did he want to preside -- 
and I know people -- I see some skeptical looks when I say that.  That is in your program. 
 That is part of the debate topic and the acknowledgment that, over the last 30 years, 
drug use has been cut in half in our country.  And we have a president that says he does 
not want to see it go up on his watch. 
 
19:09:03 
 
Could it be that he does not believe that the United States ought to break its treaty 
obligations in which we've entered into and been a leader across the globe?  And that is 
reason enough to vote against the proposition.  Or perhaps he was thinking about his 
own daughters and his grandchildren, and would there be greater potential for them to 
be engaged in drug use that he might believe is harmful in -- whenever we continue to 
have it illegal in our country?  And so the president made that decision both personally, 
he said, and with his administration.  Let's look at the argument that's been presented. 
 And first, I would say I've been introduced as a former administrator of the DEA.  That is 
absolutely true.  I'm also a front line prosecutor, a former prosecutor in Arkansas that's 
prosecuted cocaine cases and marijuana cases and on down the line, primarily of 
traffickers. 
 
19:10:01 
 
And my experience is just the opposite of Paul.  In fact, when I went into a store recently 
to sign up for some exercise, the owner came up and said, "You put me in prison."  I 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

thought I was going to be thrown out of the place.  But he looked at me, and he said, "I 
wanted to thank you for helping to turn my life around, because I was going down the 
wrong path of addiction.  I was going down the wrong path of violation of the law, and it 
turned me around."  And today he owns his own business.  And so I've had a totally 
different experience as former federal prosecutor.  They say the current model of 
prohibition is not working.  Well, while that might appeal to the popular culture, it does 
not pass muster in close examination.  In fact, drug usage is down over the last 30 years.  
Whenever you look at our war on poverty that president Lyndon Johnson proclaimed, 
what, 30, 35 years ago, whenever he proclaimed that, have we eliminated poverty 
today?  Does that mean, because we have not eliminated poverty that we should stop 
fighting hunger?  Of course not. 
 
19:11:12 
 
Well, we call it a war on drugs, which is not my preferred terminology.  I believe it is an 
effort to save lives.  It is our youth.  It is our families, it is our communities at stake.  
How do you decrease harmful drugs in our community?  Is it by legalization or is it by 
our present method of saying, let's improve the system.  Let's make it better.  But let's 
don't throw it out and say we're going to just turn off the spigot and make everything 
legal.  Secondly, they talk about harm.  If you believe that addictive and mind-altering 
drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine are harmful, if you believe that 
they are harmful, then ask this question. 
 
19:11:59 
 
If you legalize, will it increase or decrease the use and the availability of harmful drugs?  
Now, if you believe that they're not harmful, I'm not sure I can win your debate.  But if 
you believe they're harmful, ask the fundamental question, will it increase or decrease 
usage?  Now, Paul made the point that you look at -- you know more alcoholics today 
than you do people who are drug addicts.  But did ending prohibition on alcohol 
increase or decrease alcohol consumption in the United States of America?  And if you 
increase drug usage, will it increase drug addiction, harmful reaction to it?  They cannot 
show -- and I believe the burden is on them -- they cannot show that logically and over 
history, that if you decriminalize, if you legalize harmful drugs, the usage is going to go 
down.  That has not been the experience in the Netherlands.  It's not been the 
experience in the United Kingdom.  It's not been the experience in Alaska.  It has not 
been the experience in Canada.  Usage has gone up. 
 
19:13:04 
 
And so, finally, in my opening, they ask me -- or Paul mentioned my family.  Well, if my 
children came to me, and there was a drug issue, my first concern is, where are they 
getting those drugs?  What is the availability?  How can we shut that down?  And as a 
parent, it would scare me to death to think that there is going to be easy availability, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

increased availability and that you can find heroin and methamphetamine just as 
acceptable in our society as alcohol.  That creates a problem as a parent in my mind. 

 
John Donvan: 
Asa Hutchinson, thank you very much.

I have to acknowledge, I let you go over about 30 seconds because you were talking 
about your family and it just seemed that it would be so rude to step in and not let you 
finish.  Nick, if you need an extra 30, you've got it.

hopefully I'll need only about three minutes.

John Donvan: 
-- before you start, because I want to introduce you, and I also want to tell our radio 
audience, a reminder of where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of 
this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four debaters, two 
teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "Legalize drugs."  You have heard two of 
the opening statements, and now on to the third, debating in support of the motion, 
"Legalize Drugs," the editor-in-chief of Reason.com and Reason TV, he's the author of 
"The Declaration of Independents," T-S, and described as one of the foremost 
libertarians in America.  Ladies and gentlemen, Nick Gillespie. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
I do want to point out in all fairness that being among the foremost libertarians in 
America means that myself and my coauthor, you know, that's basically it.

So, you know, you've heard from a self described soldier in the drug war.  You've heard 
from a general, a commander, former Drug Enforcement Administration personnel in 
the drug war.  You'll hear from a medic in the drug war.  I present myself simply as a 
conscientious objector in the war on drugs. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Let me explain a bit of why I think we should legalize drugs.  And the first -- I want to 
make two large points.  First is, let's look at this war on drugs which is supposedly -- you 
know, the light is at the end of the tunnel, we're going to bring the troops home by 
Christmas.  This is what Asa Hutchinson was saying, essentially, when he's saying, "Look, 
you know, it's been working pretty well these past 30 years.  Drug use is down.  If we get 
rid of the war on drugs, drug use will go up."  So I want to talk about that.  And then I 
want to address some of the things that Paul previewed for you.  And, first and 
foremost, I want to make this statement.  And half of you in this audience, if you are 
representative, are with me in your action in what economists call revealed preference. 
 
19:16:03 
 
You know, using drugs is not immoral.  It is not addictive for 99 percent of people.  And 
there's nothing wrong with it or to be ashamed about with it.  Look, any program -- it's 
not a war on drugs, it is a war on racial, ethnic, and age-based minorities, because it's 
kids who get wrapped up in the war on drugs; it's not old people.  Any program that has 
such disparate impacts as the ones that Paul was talking about should come under 
scrutiny regardless of its intentions and its champions.  As a 2005 cost benefit analysis of 
the war on drugs, by the super conservative American Enterpriser Institute, which 
looked at the effectiveness, the conclusion by David Boyum and Peter Reuter was 
American drug policy has little to show by way of success for that $2.5 trillion that John 
mentioned at the beginning of the program. 
 
19:16:57 
 
And they claim it is surely reasonable to ask those who would maintain the status quo 
for some basis for believing the additional expense and suffering of putting hundreds of 
thousands of people a year in jail are justified.  Another AEI scholar -- and AEI, you'll 
remember it from the Iraq and Afghanistan war, this is a think tank that has never met a 
war it doesn't like -- Mark Perry, an economist at AEI, has pointed out that between 
1970 and 2010 annual spending on drug control has gone up 10 times, adjusted for 
inflation, while the addiction rate has remained flat.  In other words, we have become 
the world's largest jailer nation without seriously getting better outcomes.  The only 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

other place where we stand for that kind of massive increase in spending with flat or 
declining results is public education, which is no model for any kind of program going 
forward. 
 
[applause] 
 
Across every conceivable front, the war on drugs is losing the battle for hearts and 
minds.  A recent Rasmussen  poll just -- you know, which is a right leaning pollster, 8 
percent of people think we're winning the war on drugs. 
 
19:18:07 
 
A century of failure, because it starts with the 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act or Controlled 
Substances Act, has finally woken Americans up to the simple fact that prohibition 
exacerbates all of the social problems it is supposed to ameliorate.  It doesn't make 
things better, it makes everything worse.  Despite attempts to control -- to stem the 
supply of drugs, the amount and quality of drugs continues to go up while the inflation 
adjusted price goes down.  As Washington State and Colorado were voting to legalize 
marijuana, Californians voted to change its mandatory sentencing laws that grew out of 
concern about drug crime because its prisons are choked by non-violent drug offenders 
while they have to let rapists and murderers out.  The Rand Corporation and other think 
tanks have found no consistent correlation between a nation's legal regime towards 
drugs and use rate. 
 
19:18:59 
 
So in some countries you have lax drug laws and high use rates or low use rates.  In 
places like America we have stern drug laws and high use rates.  It's not clear what's 
going on; we do know in Portugal, which decriminalized all drugs, that use rates and 
addiction rates went down, because people got better information and they were more 
willing to come forward before they developed problems.  
 
So, if you're concerned on the effects of drug use on a society, you should reject the 
failed policies pursued by often well-meaning, but seriously misinformed drug warriors, 
also known as the loyal opposition here.  
 
[laughter] 
 
Well, such basic empirical scrutiny alone should convince all observers to consider an 
unconditional surrender in what is rightly called America's longest war.  I want to make 
a brief case for what I call pharmacological freedom, or granting adult Americans the 
broadest possible rights to choose what substances we put into our bodies.  And here is 
where I go into the meth round, because I'm running out of time.  
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[laughter] 
 
19:19:58 
 
 
This should be recognized.  Pharmacological freedom should be recognized as a basic 
right.  Over the past several decades, we have become a drug-taking culture, and we all 
believe in what DuPont used to advertise as "better living through chemistry."  We take 
drugs to change our cholesterol levels, to change our work habits, to change our moods.  
None of this is going away, nor should it.  We do all sorts of things to make ourselves 
look and feel better.  To the extent that we might be able to use drugs that are currently 
arbitrarily deemed illicit, not just illegal, but illicit, by the government, the better.  Ladies 
and gentlemen, if we don't have the right, literally, to change our mind through our 
personal choices, what rights do we have that are worth a damn?  Now, drug 
legalization is not a scary prospect.  It's not the radical change that its champions claim 
not its opponents fear.  And let me -- as I'm winding down, how many of you have tried 
an illegal drug?  Raise your hand. 
 
[applause] 
 
Anybody carrying? 
 
[laughter] 
 
And if so -- okay.  I'll talk to you later.  
 
19:21:01 
 
Male Speaker: 
Nick, for our radio audience, how many hands did you see up? 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
I think it was about 100 percent. 
 
[laughter] 
 
For use, not carrying, okay.  Because otherwise I think I see Asa hitting "911" under the 
table. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Look, according to government statistics, fully 47 percent of Americans over the age of 
12 have done so.  A population that includes, at least, the last three presidents of the 
United States, which, granted, may constitute the strongest argument against using 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

drugs -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- but drug use is a normal phenomenon, very few people become addicts.  So when we 
are talking about what drug legalization would look like, first off, it's all marijuana use.  
Vanishingly small people -- percentage of people use drugs other than marijuana.  But 
let me just say, I'll close with -- there's not a single dimension across which pot is more 
dangerous than alcohol, which is pretty much all you need to know about a post-
prohibition American society. 
 
19:22:01 
 
It would be a lot like today, except that you would have one or two more choices in your 
medicine cabinet, and about 400,000 fewer people a year would go to jail; police would 
be able to focus on actual criminals and Monday mornings would be a lot easier to face. 
 
[laughter] 
 
So, please, think about legalizing drugs.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Nick Gillespie. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that's our motion, legalize drugs.  And now, our final debater speaking against this 
motion, Theodore Dalrymple.  He's a retired doctor who practiced in an inner-city 
hospital and a prison.  He's also a prolific writer and he's a fellow at the Manhattan 
Institute.  Ladies and gentlemen, Theodore Dalrymple. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:22:49 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's alleged by the proposers of this motion that the harms 
that arise from illicit drug taking, production, and distribution arise because of their 
illegality, and not because of their nature, and that, therefore, if we could only just go 
down to our local corner store to pick up crack, or [unintelligible], or 
methamphetamine, or heroine, or LSD, et cetera, whenever we've run out, the harms 
would be eliminated and very much reduced.  And, incidentally, Portugal has not 
legalized drugs, and no country has.  Anyway, it is not so that the harms arise from 
illegality.  In this country, about as many people now die annually from opioid poisoning 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

as from homicide.  Those people -- opioids are overwhelming prescription drugs 
obtained perfectly legally.  About 15,000 a year die of these drugs.  But the supply and 
demand of them arose suddenly in a matter of a handful of years.  And it was all nice 
and above board. 
 
19:23:58 
 
There are now said to be 2 million addicts to these drugs, and all, as I said, created 
perfectly legally.  And this is all within a decade, more or less a decade.  Now, I suppose 
that our libertarian opponents would say that the problem here the control exercised 
over the supply by the mafia, the medical mafia, that is.  And if only the drugs were 
really freely available on a truly open market, if only the medical mafia was sidelined, all 
would be well.  Well, you can't expect me as a doctor really to agree with that 
proposition.  This example shows that supply can produce a large and disastrous 
demand.  Another example is the diversion on a massive scale of a drug called 
buprenorphine which is used very widely in France in the treatment of heroin addicts. 
 And it's diverted to Georgia.  That's the ex-Soviet Union republic of Georgia. 
 
19:24:58 
 
According to the Lancet, 250,000 people in that country, that is more than 1 in 20 of the 
population, are now addicted to the drug diverted from France, which again shows quite 
apart from casting doubt on how badly the addicts needed or wanted the drug in the 
first place, how a perfectly legal drug can create an enormous sudden and disastrous 
demand.   Our opponents would have to allege that had buprenorphine been legally 
available in -- to the Georgians, none of this would have happened.  In Scotland, as a 
whole, and in Dublin, more people are now dying of a perfectly legal drug, methadone, 
first developed to help the late Hermann Goering to get through the war without 
withdrawal symptoms from heroin, then from heroin.  And this drug is used in supposed 
treatment of heroin addiction.  So the legal drug is now killing more than the illegal 
drug.  
 
19:26:00 
 
So it's not true that the harms of drugs arise only from their illegality.  We've seen that 
even if ever homicide in this country, every single one, with a result of the illicit trade in 
drugs, which is an absurd proposition, deaths from legally obtained opioids would equal 
to deaths from that trade.  And that demand was created very, very quickly. 
 
It's also alleged by the proposals that criminality is caused, more or less, by the illegality 
of drugs.  And again, this is not so.  In the prison in which I worked, I discovered that the 
heroin addicts who were imprisoned there and had committed -- they had committed 
between 50 and 200 offenses before they ever took heroin.  Therefore, it will be more 
true to say that they were addicts because they were criminal than that they were 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

criminal because they were addicts.  This has been found elsewhere.  And research 
shows that criminality is a better predictor of addiction than is addiction of criminality. 
 
19:27:08 
 
And this can be seen from the career of the writer William S. Burroughs, with which you 
might be familiar, who, as you know, shot his wife dead.  He -- in my opinion, he was an 
even worse writer than he was a husband. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But we don't have any time for literary criticism.  The point is that he was fascinated by 
crime and committed criminal acts well before he became an addict. 
 
In the hospital in which I worked, I once walked into the intensive care unit to find two 
drug dealers who had shot each other at close quarters, but with thorough British 
incompetence, had failed to kill one another. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Well, what do you suppose that such people would be doing if they were not shooting 
at one another? 
 
19:28:01 
 
Would they have been doing remedial teaching, for example, or deciphering cuneiform 
script in the British museum?  It's absurd.  And criminal -- criminal gangs are not going to 
file for bankruptcy if drugs are legalized.  They're going to change their activities.  So 
making the importation or production, distribution, and sale of drugs would be 
dangerous, and it would not have the claimed benefits because the illegality of drugs is 
the occasion and not the cause of crime.  And therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you 
to vote against the motion. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Theodore Dalrymple. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our 
motion is "Legalize Drugs." 
 
19:28:57 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Now we move on to round two.  Round two is where the debaters address one another 
directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience.  We have two teams 
of two arguing out this motion:  "Legalize Drugs."  The team arguing for the motion, Paul 
Butler and Nick Gillespie are arguing -- you've heard them say that basically partly it's a 
freedom thing that grownups have the right to put what they want in their own bodies 
as they do with the drug called alcohol.  A lesson in history that criminalizing a drug is 
actually going to backfire.  But beyond that, they say that the war on drugs, the 
embodiment of drugs as illegal costs in too many ways without a resulting drop in crime 
significantly, and that it disproportionately hits the African-American community in 
terms of people getting locked up behind bars simply for possession of drugs.  The team 
arguing for the motion, Asa Hutchinson and Theodore Dalrymple, they're saying you 
cannot say that the war on drugs has failed, not when drug use among Americans has 
dropped 50 percent in 30 years. 
 
19:30:04 
 
They also point to the fact that drugs and crime and addiction go together.  They point 
to prescription drugs, for example, which are legal.  But their use is mired in crime and 
addiction.  Those are some of the arguments we've heard presented.  And we're going 
to work through some of them in more detail now.  And I want to go first to the team 
arguing against the motion to legalize drugs.  Your opponents have made the claim that 
the war on drugs as constructed really is a war on young black kids, that it is -- that the 
number of kids who are put in jail for drug possession, mere drug possession is just 
disproportionately high and has had terrible consequences on the community.  And I 
want to know, does your side concede or refute that basic claim?  Asa Hutchinson? 
 
19:30:50 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, I think it's an issue that has to continually be looked at.  I think there was a 
disparity in penalties that impacted our African-American community when it came to 
crack and powder cocaine.  We made a huge step forward.  Congress passed a remedy 
to that.  I think there's been some challenges with the mandatory minimums that's 
made -- we've made some corrections in that as well.  But you look at 
methamphetamine, it's such a huge problem across all of the Midwest.  That's 
predominantly a Caucasian drug.  It -- and that's where the law enforcement is enforcing 
its efforts right now.  So I don't concede the point at all.  But I think we -- you look at the 
African-American communities, and we have significant amount in Arkansas.  We have 
high poverty rates.  We have high unemployment rates right now.  We have many social 
problems that are impacted by the community.  And it is reflected also in what happens 
in the drug world. 
 
19:31:56 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let's go to the other side.  Paul Butler, do you want to respond to that? 
 
Paul Butler: 
Yeah.  It's just not true.  Asa makes it sound like blacks use drugs more than anybody 
else.  And as anyone who's been to college or high school knows, it's simply not true. 
 We really shouldn't be talking about legalizing drugs.  We should be talking about re-
legalizing them.  For most of our history, drugs have been perfectly legal.  You can go 
into a drugstore in the 1800s and buy opium.  Coca-Cola started out with a cocaine 
derivative in it.  So what made them become illegal?  Nothing to do with public safety. 
 It was all about race.  First drug criminalized, opium.  San Francisco, 1890, the concern 
was that Chinamen were using it to seduce white women, can trace it right down the 
line.  Marijuana, Mexican field hands.  It was making them lazy.  With blacks, it was that 
Coke and ice.  Negroes were running rampant in the South.  So our war on drugs is 
about race through and through.  It always has been, and it is right now. 
 
19:32:57 
 
John Donvan: 
But Paul, you're saying that is the sole motive for it? 
 
Paul Butler: 
I don't think that that's the only motive.  But I think that when we look historically at 
how the drug laws have been used -- what happens to white people who use drugs? 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, let me let the other side respond to [unintelligible]. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
-- methamphetamine that's predominantly a white drug that enforcement efforts across 
mid-America is directed at that.  They're the ones that are impacted. 
 
Paul Butler: 
But why don't prisons look like America then? 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
That's not race based.  That is across the board somebody who is engaged in 
methamphetamine production.  That's who the prosecution's about. 
 
Paul Butler: 
But in -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Asa Hutchinson: 
I have a question for you that I would like to ask, Mr. Moderator, John, that we didn't 
really cover this, and that is how legalization would work.  If it's legalized tomorrow, I 
would assume that we would be able to go down and get our methamphetamines. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, I actually do want to come to that question, because I think it's a terrific one, but I 
just want to have these guys respond to the point you were just making on the race 
issue -- 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Well, let me -- 
 
John Donvan: 
-- and the methamphetamine [unintelligible]. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
You know, I side with Paul in a sense that the origins of drug prohibition, and many of 
the continuum policies are inextricably and I think incontrovertibly linked to race or 
other out group stigma.  LSD became associated with young people in the '60s.  It was 
bad.  There was legal effectivelyuntil 1967 -- 
 
19:34:10 
 
John Donvan: 
But weren't young people considered pretty cool in the '60s? 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Not by old people, you know? 
 
[laughter] 
 
And the same thing happened with ecstasy.  How many of you -- I mean, if you're over 
50, you had the opportunity to use ecstasy legally until 1986.  It was then demonized as 
a youth drug, first, one that made you antisocial, then one that made you prosocial and 
you'd go out to a rave and have sex all night or dehydrate.  But more importantly -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- you know, well, hydration is very important, you know.  It's the skin. 
 
[laughter] 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

More importantly, we need to dial back the hysteria.  So, for instance, I just want to 
focus on one point that was being -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Nick -- Asa -- 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
-- wait, just -- 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no -- 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
-- methamphetamine, one-tenth of 1 percent of people in America report having used it 
in the past 30 days.  Is the drug war edifice, all of the costs in money and in monetary 
and human terms, is it worth trying to stop that one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans -- 
 
19:35:10 
 
John Donvan: 
[unintelligible] Theodore Dalrymple, arguing against the motion. 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
I just want to make a small logical point.  We are not actually discussing whether the 
laws are correctly applied but whether there should be any laws.  And so actually it's not 
-- I mean, I know that it's very important for people in America, the way that they are 
applied, but the fact is that we're debating whether there should be any laws at all, not 
whether we should have present laws. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let's take Asa's question to you, Nick Gillespie. 
 
[applause] 
 
Asa Huntchinson, you were asking what does this new world look like where drugs are 
legalized? 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
May I frame it? 
 
John Donvan: 
Sure. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Asa Hutchinson: 
So in terms of -- take heroin or methamphetamine, I would presume if it's legalized the 
state would be granting licenses so they can regulate the purity and the quality of the 
heroin and that the methamphetamine is quality stuff. 
 
19:36:07 
 
So if you regulate it, and you have to regulate it to tax it, so I am curious, one, is this not 
another government regime that's being created with a libertarian argument that you're 
creating?  So you're creating more government by your libertarian approach, wanting to 
legalize drugs because they're going to have to regulate it and tax it -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- so how's that going to work?  I -- 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, Nick Gillespie. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
-- respectfully submit that I have never taken a drug strong enough for that argument to 
be convincing. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
But in Colorado, you know, the initiative that was passed for marijuana legalization was 
basically, I mean, it was out there, and it's a similar thing in Washington State, to treat 
marijuana like wine, beer, and alcohol.  So it's not a question -- and, Theodore, I think 
your opposition is -- 
 
19:36:59 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
So it's licensed by the state. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
-- is a false -- yeah, well, it could be.  That remains to be seen actually because each -- 
Washington State has about a year to figure out the technical implementation and 
Colorado has about six months, but it's not a choice between anarchy and, I'll ratchet it 
down, regulatory system, but there will be laws.  There will be customs.  There will be 
traditions.  There will be advertising.  There will be information available.  And I -- the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

real question is about legalizing drugs.  Do you consider alcohol to be legal?  Let's have a 
regime that is very similar to that for currently illegal substances. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me step in and ask Paul Butler something.  Paul, you made -- drew a distinction 
between treating addiction and punishing addiction, which suggests that perhaps unlike 
your partner you're talking about addiction as a problem that needs to be addressed by 
society.  Do you split with each other on that?  Do you think that it's this -- in other 
words, are you saying drug use is a problem?  
 
19:38:00 
 
Paul Butler: 
Well, I think addiction is a medical issue, and I think Nick and I agree that only a small 
percentage of people who use drugs become addicted to it.  So most people are able to 
use marijuana and other drugs recreationally and go to work the next day.  Most people 
are also able to do that with alcohol.  For the percentage of people who have substance 
abuse problems with it, we know, the good doctor knows, that's a health issue.  Police, 
prosecutors, they make lousy doctors.  Jailers make even worse doctors.  So the way to 
treat that problem, the way to heal those people is to use what we know about, and not 
what we know about locking people up, because what we know about locking people up 
is, it doesn't work.  
 
John Donvan: 
Dr. Dalrymple. 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Well, I actually don't agree that addiction is a -- it's fundamentally a medical problem.  
 
Paul Butler: 
You think it's a moral problem? 
 
19:38:59 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
I do, yes. 
 
Paul Butler: 
Wow. 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Well, a moral problem and a social problem and psychological problem and a spiritual 
problem.  It's only to a very small extent a medical problem.  I mean, there are medical 
consequences, of course, but this is not what is important.  For example, everything -- I 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

think that everything you think about heroin addiction is actually wrong.  For example, 
you probably think that withdrawal effects from heroin are very severe, they're not, 
they're trivial.  And the overwhelming evidence is that, by far, the most suffering from 
withdrawal effects is psychologically induced; it's anticipatory anxiety, it isn't the -- and 
there's good experimental evidence about this.  You think that it’s highly addictive, it 
isn't.   Most heroin addicts go at it for about a year before they're ever actually addicted. 
 You think that there's a connection -- I've described the supposed connection between 
crime and addiction. 
 
19:40:01 
 
The idea is that an addict goes out to obtain money in order for his addiction; there's no 
correlation in the amount of crime he commits and the amount of drugs he takes.  And, 
actually, you find that they're all acquisitive criminals before they ever take heroin. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me ask your partner, Asa Hutchinson, a little bit of -- moving the discussion a little 
bit in a slightly more, perhaps, philosophical direction.  Maybe that's the wrong word.  
But we've heard a few references to alcohol and to prohibition and to the notion that, I 
think, nobody is disputing that alcohol is a drug on the panel, and the nation did try, 
amended the Constitution, to outlaw alcohol consumption and decided it was a mistake.   
So, tonight everybody in the room can go afterwards and enjoy a glass of wine or a beer.  
What's the difference between alcohol and the prescribed drugs? 
 
19:40:55 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
They're all problematic drugs subject to abuse.  In our democracy, we make decisions on 
which ones to legalize and which ones not to.  Those are decisions that are made.  The 
debate question tonight, though, of course, is legalizing all drugs.  And, again, I go back 
to the question, which relates to ending prohibition in the  late 1920s.  You ended 
prohibition on alcohol, use went up, availability went up, regulation went up, taxation 
went up, and you compare that to legalizing methamphetamine.  You're going to have 
an opportunity for the state to regulate methamphetamine producers, you're going to 
have it available, because it's going to be legal, and it's going to be taxed, and so, the 
price will be set by the market place, which is regulated and taxed.  And so, the question 
is, "Will you end crime?  Will you end the cartels?  Will you end the black market 
because you regulate methamphetamine?"  Of course not. 
 
19:42:01 
 
There's going to be those that don't want to pay the taxes, just like they don't want to 
pay the taxes on cigarettes, and there's going to be a black market there, and you're 
going to have enforcement efforts, you're going to have criminals out there that are still

bypassing the law, and so all of your hope of ending the DEA or ending law enforcement 
will not happen with legalization.  
 
John Donvan: 
Nick Gillespie. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
I think there's a major, kind of, conceptual error when we're talking about crime here. 
When -- we know that Mexican drug cartels are killing people on both sides of the 
border.  When's the last time you heard about a Dos Equis shoot out? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Where a beer distributor crossing the border -- 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Hundreds of times [unintelligible] murders committed under the influence of alcohol. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
The last time you heard about that sort of thing was during alcohol prohibition.  And so, 
it's not that -- 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Are you going to have a black market for methamphetamine? 
 
19:42:54 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Sure.  You know what?  We already do.  What would happen is, if we had a legal one, 
the other social harms would be reduced.  I'm not a utopian, what I do believe is that 
not only would responsible individuals have a broader palate of things to make their life 
better, but also, many bad things would diminish.  When we're talking addiction or 
substance abuse -- you know, I don't drink anymore, because I was a bad drinker; I tried 
my hardest to drink and drink and drink, I gave it up.  If I had to admit that I was a 
criminal as well as having a substance abuse problem, I doubt that I would've gotten 
there quite as fast as I did, which was long enough. 
 
[applause] 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
A couple of small points.  The murder rate in Mexico is now between a third and quarter 
of what it was in the 1940s.  That might surprise you, but it is a fact.  When we look at 
the murder rate during prohibition, it is, of course, perfectly true that it went up during 
prohibition.  It went up by 35 percent.  And it came down after prohibition was ended. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
19:44:01 
 
But in the same period before prohibition, the murder rate went up by 85 percent.  And 
in six years between 1900 and 1906, the murder rates in this country went up by 325 
percent.  So I think that the relationship between violent crime and prohibition is 
probably not nearly as close as people imagine and that there was a secular trend in 
which it went up anyway.  And you could even make the case that it slowed the rise in 
the murder rate.  I wouldn't make that case.  But it's not straight -- it's not as straight 
forward -- the world did not begin in 1919.  And the murder rate went up both 
absolutely and relatively more before -- in the years before prohibition than during 
prohibition.  And incidentally, Scarface got his scar before prohibition.  And he didn't get 
it from plastic surgery. 
 
19:45:05 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul Butler? 
 
Paul Butler: 
So the reason that most people don't smoke isn't because smoking tobacco is a crime. 
 It's because we know it's not good for us.  That's the same reason why even a regime of 
legalization, the vast majority of us are not going to use heroin or meth.  But it's public 
health that will be responsible -- the most responsible way for treating people who 
abuse those substances. 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul, can I interrupt?  I'm going to ask a question from something that Asa Hutchinson, 
your opponent said earlier, in which he reported that in the last 30 years, the use of 
drugs by Americans has declined 50 percent.  And he sees that correlation being directly 
related to causation, that the drug war actually means that fewer men's use drugs.  Are 
you impressed by that statistic? 
 
19:45:59 
 
Paul Butler: 
I'm not, in part because we have to do our cost-benefit analysis.  We have to ask if that's 
true, is it worth it?  The costs have been 2.5 million people in prison, the costs have 
been one in three young black men with a criminal case, more African-American young 
men in prison than in college.  The cost has been billions of dollars that we can't afford, 
money away from our schools, away from our healthcare system, going straight to 
prison.  So especially if we understand that those are people who are locked up for using 
drugs.  I don't have a problem.  If you steal, if you rob, then yes, you should be punished. 
 But when we're thinking about people who are locked up, 500,000 people, those are 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

nonviolent drug offenders.  And again, entirely selective.  They're African-American and 
Latino two-thirds of them.  There're some states where 80 to 90 percent of the people 
in prison for drug crimes are black.  And we know that's not the reality of who's using 
drugs.  That's selective law enforcement. 
 
19:47:06 
 
John Donvan: 
Asa Hutchinson, would you like to respond? 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, first, to go along with my partner, that the issue is not our enforcement policies 
currently, but it's whether we're going to legalize all drugs.  That's the issue before us. 
 
Paul Butler: 
How can you separate those? 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, I think you can -- that's not the debate topic, how you separate those.  But in 
terms -- if you look at Oxycontin, it's a white abused drug.  If you look at LSD, it's a white 
abused drug.  If you look at cocaine, it's -- you know, crack cocaine has minorities.  
You've got powder cocaine, that's white abused.  You've got heroin that's across the 
board.  You've got GHB, you've got ecstasy that was mentioned.  So I just don't see the 
racial component to it.  Obviously, I think as head of the -- former head of the DEA, we 
looked at enforcement policy.  You've got to be careful. 
 
19:47:59 
 
You don't want to -- the south side of Chicago put all your enforcement resources on the 
crack distributor when you're ignoring the white guy coming from the suburb.  That's 
wrong enforcement policies.  You've got to balance those.  But those are remedies 
within the current system.  Legalizing it dramatizes the problem.  You still have 
education issues, as you pointed out, where you have to spend dollars on education, 
probably even more because you've got more availability out there.  You're going to 
have to spend money on the regulatory side.  So all of those issues that are concerned 
about in society will only increase if you increase legalization. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Can I ask -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Nick Gillespie -- I'm going to let you speak, one second.  After Nick speaks, I'd like to 
start coming to you in the audience for questions.  So just remember, raise your hand.  I 
have a little bit of difficulty seeing people who are towards the back and out of the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

bright lights, so you might want to come forward.  If you raise your hand, I'll call on you, 
and I mic will come to you, and you can ask a question.  Nick Gillespie. 
 
19:48:57 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
I mean, I'd like too defer to the experience and the expertise of the opposition to 
legalization.  But I'm left wondering what world we're talking about here.  So they're 
talking about how bad Oxycontin is.  Oxycontin is a prescription drug that is already legal 
and regulated.  I don't see how that really has a lot to do with talking about a 
legalization debate.  It's already legal.  And here are the stats that are important.  The 
government runs something called the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.  And 
basically, 30 -- in the past month use, they ask people, have you used this drug in the 
past 30 days, which is kind of a proxy for, you know, a regular user or a casual user. 
 About 7 percent of people over the ages of 12 -- 12-year-olds by the way, you know 
almost a hundred percent, they say yes to everything. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But about 7 percent of Americans say that they've used pot in the past month.  That by 
far -- by a factor of three or more, that's the most widely used illegal drug, or legal drug 
that's used illegally. 
 
19:50:02 
 
The next one is opioids, the prescription drugs that Theodore was talking about, which 
comes in at 2.7 percent.  When you're talking about things like meth and heroin, one-
tenth of one percent.  Hallucinogens covering a wide range of things, five-tenths of one 
percent.  Crack or cocaine, including crack, six-tenths of one percent.  These are 
nonfactors.  And as Paul was suggesting, if they're made legal, who out here is going to 
be like, finally, heroin is legal, you know?  You know, let's go.  Let's try it.  No.  Okay, 
that's not going to happen.  It's about pot.  And we all know that pot is not a dangerous 
drug, that pot is not a gateway anymore than mother's milk, you know, is the ultimate 
gateway drug because everybody who uses heroin started out with mother's milk.  But 
it's about pot, and we need to focus on that. 
 
19:50:56 
 
John Donvan: 
I actually wanted to -- 
 
Paul Butler: 
-- it's not an issue then -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
I want to hear the -- I want to hear your opponents respond to the notion of whether 
drug use overall would soar if it were legalized. 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Well, no one can say with any absolute certainty. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, I know, but -- 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
But all one can say -- I don't know what to say to someone who tells me that the deaths 
of 15,000 people a year is not really a problem -- 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
-- the incarceration of 500,000 people, you know, that's about how -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let him make his point and -- 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Hang on.  And 2 million people being addicted to it.  So it is actually an important point 
that if you make something readily available, the use of it can increase catastrophically. 
 Now, I can't, of course, say, that I know for a fact if methamphetamine were just 
available like everything else, or crack were available, you just went down and got it, of 
course not everybody would take it. 
 
19:51:56 
 
But I have an experience.  And this was an experience working in Africa with some 
expatriates.  And for various reasons I won't go into, alcohol became -- virtually free of 
charge.  And the result was absolutely catastrophic.  The increase in the consumption 
was enormous.  And, of course, not -- in fact, the majority of people didn't take it to 
extremes.  But 20 percent of people did. 
 
John Donvan: 
Asa, your partner wants to join in on this point, I think. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
I agree.  I think logic tells you usage goes up.  But recent information, Alaska, through a 
court case, decriminalized marijuana in the 70s.  Usage went up.  Parents were 
concerned, and they voted to recriminallize it in the '90s.  That's a historic experience 
among our states.  And so usage did go up, and parents recognized that and reversed 
the trend in Alaska.

19:52:59 
 
This debate is not about marijuana.  It is drugs, plural.  And to be consistent in your 
philosophy of libertarianism, which my colleagues are consistent, they recognize it 
doesn't do any good to legalize one.  You have to legalize all.  And if you -- because 
that's the only way you're going to change the environment of enforcement, to change 
the environment of police and so on.  And so the debate tonight is about legalizing all 
drugs. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let's go to some questions from the audience.  I want to remind you that we 
are now in the question-and-answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. 
 I'm John Donvan, your moderator.  We have four debaters, two against two, who are 
arguing it out over this motion:  “Legalize drugs," and, ma'am, right in the center, there. 
 If you look to your right, there's a microphone coming down.  If you could just stand up 
and tell us your name, thanks. 
 
19:53:53 
 
Female Speaker: 
Hi. 
 
John Donvan: 
Hi. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Patsy Cohn [spelled phonetically].  Paul Butler mentioned smoking, and I have a 
question, the laws in New York have gotten so much more stringent against smoking. 
You can't smoke in the parks, you certainly cannot smoke in a restaurant or a bar, and 
taxes on cigarettes have gone up significantly.  So your argument would be that none of 
that affects people lowering the smoking rate, that, in fact, it's only health issues, and I 
would wonder what the statistics are on that. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, I'm not going to hold them to knowing the statistics, because they might not 
know, and it would just be embarrassing.  But let's take on your larger principle. 
 
Paul Butler: 
So -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul Butler. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Paul Butler: 
-- I am concerned about this nanny state that the government is creating where we can't 
have -- it started with certain drugs, and it seems to be going down the road to trans 
fats, right, to smoking in parks, smoking tobacco in parks, and even big gulp cans of 
soda. 
 
19:54:55 
 
So if we buy this idea that people aren't responsible enough to make intelligent 
decisions for themselves, which my opponents don't seem to think people are, we ought 
to be concerned about these draconian laws, and we ought to especially be concerned 
about who they're going to be applied against.  I guarantee you that white people -- very 
few white people in New York are going to be arrested for smoking in parks.  It's going 
to be African-Americans and Latinos.  That's the reality.  We can't divorce the reality 
from this rhetoric. 
 
John Donvan: 
Response from the other side. 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Well, I think the -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Theodore Dalrymple. 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
-- fact is that people stopped smoking in bars because there was a law against it and 
they did it on a certain day.  They didn't suddenly realize that their health would be 
impaired by it.  And interestingly, this happened throughout the world.  My wife, who's 
French, said, "The French will never obey this law," but they obeyed it like lambs. 
 
[laughter] 
 
And so -- and the reason, of course, is that smoking doesn't have the antinomian 
cultural meaning that taking drugs has, and that's why smokers will obey the law and 
others won't. 
 
19:56:07 
 
John Donvan: 
Sir. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Bob Wyman: 
I'd like to understand a bit -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Would you mind standing up? 
 
Bob Wyman: 
Sorry. 
 
John Donvan: 
And tell us your name. 
 
Bob Wyman: 
My name is Bob Wyman.  I'd like to understand a bit more, Mr. Hutchinson, the 
comments you made about that we can't legalize one without essentially legalizing 
them all, that it's not useful.  But historically we have legalized one very major one, and 
that is alcohol.  And then we have a -- sort of a regulation as well with cigarettes.  And 
then there are the various legal drugs that doctors can give you.  We've already gone 
down that path, and we've seen that, for instance, the legalization of alcohol didn't 
cause a tremendous explosion in heroin use.  Why wouldn't legalizing just one more, 
say, going with heroin, that's a -- not heroin, but -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- but going with marijuana -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
19:57:05 
 
-- got to pick the right one.  Why wouldn't going one step further and thus removing the 
tremendous amount of people who are in jail for that and all the money that's going to 
the criminals [unintelligible], why wouldn't that be used -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah, Asa Hutchinson.  Thank you. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Very good question, and I did not explain it well, so I'm glad you asked that.  And you're 
right.  We're a democracy so you could -- society could choose to legalize heroin if you 
wish or marijuana and pick one of them.  But my argument would be generally people 
say, "Well, one of the reason we need to legalize, because you got to put the cartels out 
of business.  And you've got to put the criminal elements out of business."  Well, they're 
smart business folks, and they have diversified.  So if you legalize marijuana, they're 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

going to trade in cocaine, methamphetamine, and they will market those.  And so if -- 
unless you legalize everything, the cartels are just happy as a lark.  And even if you 
legalized everything, you're probably still going to have the black market they will deal 
in although it'll be tougher. 
 
19:58:01 
 
But the second point is simply that the debate topic is not just about marijuana, it is 
broad based legalization because -- well, that's the debate topic.  And that's what we're 
trying to stick to. 
 
John Donvan: 
Asa, if somebody wants to use any of the drugs that are currently illegal, aside from the 
fact that they're breaking the law, just in terms of the little bubble of their own life, is 
that anybody's business but their own?  Is -- in other words, where is the social 
dimension to that use? 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, the social dimension is -- and I hate to keep speaking of methamphetamine, but 
that's a real problem where I'm from -- and methamphetamine, you are manufacturing 
it, you've got children around, they're taking the methamphetamine and they're 
abandoning their kids for weeks on end.  And so it's a child welfare issue that is 
extraordinarily harmful, endangerment of those. 
 
19:59:00 
 
It is environmentally unsafe.  Now, you can say, "Well, if we get our nanny state 
involved where they regulate the -- and license the methamphetamine produces maybe 
you'll eliminate some of that."  But you're still going to have the lack of productivity in 
the workplace through drug use, and people not showing up because of they aren’t 
having a good Monday morning, as my colleague was pointing out. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Paul Butler: 
In your world, for somebody to get help, they have to admit that they're a criminal.  
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
No, you can go get treatment any time you want to. 
 
Paul Butler: 
And admit that you've broken the law? 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, of course, you know that if somebody has a problem with an addiction and they go 
into a clinic, they're not going to get arrested for it, they're going to get help, and 
they're going to get treatment.  And that's the goal in the workplace too.  If you do 
testing and you find a worker who has got an abuse problem, they're not sending them 
to the police, they're sending them to treatment.  And that's the objective of the 
employers, and that's working well in the workplace.  And all of that effort would be 
abandoned if you went through legalization.  All of the sudden, you -- why would you 
drug test anybody? 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
That's a good question.  Why do we now?  Because most people who get drug tested, 
you get drug tested when you're applying for a job and that's it.  It's a joke.  It's a hurdle 
to weed out people who -- you know, on other grounds.  The people -- 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
They have random drug testing; they test pilots.  And I'm glad for the testing of the 
pilots that fly our airplanes. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Of course.  And what airline, what airline or trucking company, or whatever, is not going 
to regularly test people, because it puts them at enormous insurance risk?  These things 
are handled and -- to talk about another market mechanism, we don't need -- and this is 
the libertarian in me speaking, we don't need the government to test and testify to the 
purity of methamphetamine, we will have fair trade methamphetamine -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- you know, private certification agencies, just like with coffee or biodynamic wine or 
organic foods -- 
 
20:01:00 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- will spontaneously spring into being.   And, just to follow up on one point, the reason 
why I'm stressing marijuana, it goes back to some things that Paul is saying, and I don't 
think that the other side is fully acknowledging, which is that we live in a world where 
school kids tell everybody who asks them, "You know, you can get drugs easier than you 
can get beer, any kind of drug you want."  The use ratios are pot, very much--much less, 
prescription drugs, and these tiny vanishing statistical errors of things like heroin.  Even 
if you double or triple the heroin use, it goes from -- one-tenth of 1 percent to three-
tenths of 1 percent.  I don't think that's a reason to hold everyone else hostage who can 
act responsibly. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
John Donvan: 
I was going to go to another question, but do you want to dispute the numbers? 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, in terms of the numbers, if you're looking at marijuana use in the schools, and the 
availability of it, I just come back to the fundamental question.  If you legalize it, two 
things happen: one, the kids say, "If it's legal for my folks, how can it be harmful?"  The 
government says it's legal now; that's a signal that it's okay and usage goes up because 
of that -- 
 
20:02:16 
 
Paul Butler: 
Nobody thinks that about tobacco.  Nobody thinks tobacco is okay because it's legal. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Hate speech is legal, kids don't say, "Oh, now I can engage in hate speech."  I think, you 
know, I, again, you know -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait, wait.  Asa was -- were you in mid-flow?  And then I'll come back to that, because – 

 
Asa Hutchinson: 
No, I'm happy to take another question. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
No, I'm just saying that, you know, fundamentally, look -- we don't live in a democracy, 
by the way; we live in a limited republican form of government which respects the rights 
of the minority.  But I don't think anybody in America mistakes the idea that something 
is allowed with something being good.  And if they are, then we really need to change 
the public education system because the kids are getting the wrong message. 
 
20:03:00 
 
John Donvan: 
But the point that Asa made that if kids see that they're parents are smoking dope or -- 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Or drinking -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
All right, but make it drinking.  You don't think that there's a lesson [unintelligible]? 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
No, actually, what I would suggest is that when you see your parents and other adults 
using a drug responsibly, and we need to keep coming back to this point, drug use does 
not equal drug abuse.  Those are two very separate things, and we can deal with them.  
But when you see your parents having a glass of wine with dinner and acting responsibly 
around an intoxicant, you learn a very strong lesson there that is going to be much more 
beneficial to you than if you grow up in a teetotaler house and then you have the 
unfortunate experience of going to Yale and Harvard like Paul here. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 

 
Asa Hutchinson: 
I don't think kids are going to be seeing parents using heroin or methamphetamine or 
cocaine responsibly.  I don't know if kids see the parents use marijuana in the home 
responsibly, does that increase usage, decrease usage?  All I can say, as a parent, I hate 
to take that experiment. 
 
20:04:10 
 
John Donvan: 
Drug use does not equal drug abuse, statement of principle from the other side, from 
your opponents.  So the side arguing against that, what do you make of that?  Theodore 
Dalrymple. 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Well, that may be perfectly true.  But the fact is that it's also true that most drunk 
drivers get home perfectly safely.  99 percent of drunk -- I know, I'm afraid to say, 
because I've done it myself. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Have you ever drunk debated, though? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Yeah, well, you're making an assumption that I'm not now.  But -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[laughter] 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
So, of course, it's perfectly true.  But the argument about cigarettes, for example, one 
hears it all the time, most people who smoke cigarettes don't actually suffer from lung 
cancer. 
 
20:05:02 
 
I mean, I've heard -- I don't know how many times I've heard it, and it's perfectly true, 
that most people who smoke cigarettes don't die of lung cancer.  But the fact is that 
most people who get lung cancer, and it's very nasty, smoke.  And the fact is, again, that 
I don't think there's any real benefit to be taken from these drugs.  And to equate the 
freedom to take drugs with the freedom of expression seems to me to trivialize what 
the freedom of expression actually is. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Ma'am, right against the wall, where the wall turns green.  If you could state your name, 
please. 
 
Diana Jiminez: 
Hi.  Diana Jiminez.  I come from Mexico.  And in the past six years, we've had 60,000 
people dead in drug-related violence.  The murder rate has gone down.  But in drug-
related violence, we've had, you know -- it's just been atrocious.  My question is, 
legalizing drugs would do better for cartel violence or worse? 
 
20:06:04 
 
John Donvan: 
And your question is to either side? 
 
Female Speaker: 
Yeah, yeah.  I want -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let's take it to this side.  And I want to -- I'll go to Paul Butler, since that used 
to be your job, to a degree. 
 
Paul Butler: 
True.  And if we listen to the leaders of the Latin American countries, they're calling for 
more responsible drug policies, including for us to consider legalization, because they 
know that the violence is sparked by the illegal market which is sparked by the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

enormous demand for drugs from the United States.  So if we get rid of that illegal 
market, including by having drugs regulated like we regulate tobacco and alcohol now, 
we'll get rid of the violence.  Again, that's exactly what happened during prohibition.  Al 
Capone wasn't nothing but a drive-by shooter.  And again, when we got rid of that illegal 
market, we got rid of the violence. 
 
20:06:59 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, to that point, the answer is absolutely no.  Did the mafia end in New York City at 
the conclusion of prohibition?  Rudy Giuliani, the former U.S. attorney, former mayor of 
New York, made himself famous by prosecuting the mob and the mafia.  They existed 
long after the ending of prohibition.  And to the lady's question about Mexico, do you 
think the legalization of drugs will put the cartel out of business?  It might make them 
adjust, but there is alien smuggling which they're engaged in now.  There's other 
activities.  But you look at the cost to the United States, I think that would just be 
enormous.  I met with president Vicente Fox whenever he was president.  He was 
concerned not only about the cartels.  He was concerned about the demand -- growing 
demand problem and usage in Mexico of his people.  And that was a concern there. 
 And so it's not just about the cartel.  It's about drug use.  I don't know of any Latin 
American country that wants to legalize all of the drugs, heroin, cocaine, down the road. 
 
20:08:06 
 
John Donvan: 
Can I -- Nick Gillespie, and then I'll come to Theodore. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Yeah, I mean, I just wanted to say very quickly, the mob moved into other illegal 
pursuits, prostitution, non-casino gambling, things like that.  And to the extent that the 
cartels in Mexico might move into human trafficking, the fix there is to legalize 
immigration, not to try and wipe out cartels. 
 
[applause] 
 
That's what I'm saying.  And the -- you know, the -- or the generational shift here might 
be the Kennedy clan.  And I say this as a half Italian, half Irish, so I've got, you know, a 
foot in each camp here. 
 
John Donvan: 
You're covered, yeah. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
But the Kennedys went from having connections in the liquor business within a 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

generation or two, to, you know, moving into politics. 
 
John Donvan: 
Harvard and Yale again. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Not a good -- not a good progression.  But the fact is, when you legalize broad swaths of 
economic activity where there is a supply and a demand, peace reigns and prosperity 
follows. 
 
20:09:04 
 
John Donvan: 
Theodore Dalrymple. 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Well, I think the idea that Mexico, or, for example, Colombia would be a peaceful 
society if it were not for drugs is absolutely ludicrous.  If one just takes the example of 
Colombia, there were two episodes in the 20th century in which the equivalent pro rata 
of the population of more than a million people were killed.  That's twice.  And the 
current civil war in Colombia started in 1964.  I remember in 1979, really before the 
drug business, I remember looking -- looking in the South American handbook which 
was the kind of book that everyone used in -- who traveled in South America and it said 
of Bogota -- and I'm quoting from memory, so it might not be quite right.  It said, "Try to 
look poor.  Do not carry anything.  Do not wear any jewelry.  And if you can see without 
them, do not wear glasses." 
 
20:10:10 
 
Now, let's say you wouldn't have that in a guide book to Switzerland.  I mean, more 
likely, you'd have, "Do not flush the lavatory after 10:00 because you'll be arrested for 
disturbing the peace."  And that's not a joke, incidentally.  So the idea that these are -- I 
mean, I've seen another thing that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, I think that you've made that point.  Let me go to the gentleman in the corner. 
 And mic will come to you.  You know, if you wouldn't mind, you're in a purple light.  And 
if you took a step three seats down you'll be in a -- in a non-purple light. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
You just want to look good on television.  Come out a little bit farther if you don't mind.

Male Speaker: 
I've been waiting for you to say that. 
 
Justin Rohrlich: 
So my sister is married to a -- 
 
John Donvan: 
What's your name?  What's your name?  You probably don't want to say now. 
 
Justin Rohrlich: 
[unintelligible] 
 
John Donvan: 
Sorry? 
 
Justin Rohrlich: 
Justin Rohrlich [spelled phonetically]. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Justin Rohrlich: 
My sister married a Dutch guy.  And they were -- their wedding was in Amsterdam, 
about seven or eight years ago.  And none of the Dutch people at the wedding could 
care less about pot.  All the Americans there, including myself, the first thing we did was 
go to the coffee shops and smoke a bunch of pot.  None of the people that lived there 
were interested at all because it seemed like, you know, they took the excitement out of 
it.  It's been available --  
 
John Donvan: 
So turn this into a question.  Turn this into a question. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Justin Rohrlich: 
So it's been available to them their whole lives, and it seems to have taken some of the -
- some of the thrill away from it.  Do you think that that would hold true here? 
  
John Donvan: 
Would pot stop being cool -- 
 
Justin Rohrlich: 
Yeah, you know, you take some of the coolness -- you know, if your parents are smoking 
pot -- 
 
20:12:00 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me -- I'm going to take the question first to Asa Hutchinson.  Would it take the thrill 
away and the attraction away? 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, perhaps. 
 
John Donvan: 
To legalize it, yeah. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
I mean, sure, if becomes very common.  But let's look more carefully.  And I've been to 
the Netherlands, and I've been to the coffee houses.  And -- but you know, you -- 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Where you drank coffee. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
You've got to -- you've got to investigate carefully. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
But the Dutch governments had second thoughts after years of expanding the cannabis 
cafes.  I think they realized that it became a tourist Mecca for that purpose, and what 
you just described.  And so the number of Dutch marijuana coffee houses dropped from 
almost 1,200 in 1997 to 782.  And so they decreased maybe -- I don't think the -- I think 
the Dutch government -- and in fact many of them -- 73 percent of the Dutch towns do 
not allow cannabis cafes. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
20:13:09 
 
And so I think it was a mistake, the path that they went down. They recognized it.  
They've retreated from that both in terms of their reputation in the commercial 
enterprise but also I just think it's the direction that the Dutch towns did not want to go 
down.  So I hope we can learn something from that.  You talk about availability because 
it was available.  I was actually going through a Dutch town with the chief of police, and I 
had people pulling on my sleeves -- I'm with the chief of police.  I'm head of the DEA. 
 And they're pulling on my sleeve saying, "Do you want some Ecstasy?" and I'm saying, 
"Hey, don't you know who I am, who I'm with?"  And it doesn't make any difference, 
because it was available and was legal. 
 
John Donvan: 
[unintelligible] Paul Butler come in. 
 
20:13:49 
 
Paul Butler: 
And so there are fewer coffeehouses because there's less of a demand.  It turned out in 
Amsterdam, when they made smoking pot legal, fewer kids wanted to do it.  It wasn't as 
cool.  So, respectfully, Dr. Theodore and Asa, if you really want kids to stop smoking pot, 
you should go on TV yourselves and fire up a big juicy blunt. 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
We're being live streamed, and we have a question that's come in to us from 
Washington State via Facebook.  Tom Glassman [spelled phonetically] writes, "I’m 
someone who lives in Washington State."  He asks, "Is the legalization of a drug, for 
example, marijuana, something that should be left to the states to decide?"  Who would 
like to take that question on?  Nick Gillespie. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Yeah, you know, this is a fascinating political question that the Obama Administration in 
particular is going to have to deal with because traditionally the democrats are at least 
over the past 30 or 40 years and Barack Obama and actually presidents in general assert 
the primacy of federal law over every matter no matter what, whether it's funding, or 
regulations, or whatnot. 
 
20:14:59 
 
I would actually -- I guess it's the second best answer to say that drug legalization should 
be left to localities or to states as opposed to a one size fits all federal solution.  By the 
same token, I do actually think that pharmacological freedom, which includes what a 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

friend of mine calls culinary freedom -- I mean, the right to ingest what you want is 
pretty fundamental and should probably be respected across the board rather than 
parceled out, but as a second best option, let's let the states and localities be 
laboratories of democracy -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Asa Hutchinson. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
-- and what happens to the experiments? 
 
John Donvan: 
Asa Hutchinson. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
No.  Well, we're -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Addressing even the Washington State situation. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Whenever Arizona experimented and thought they ought to be engaged in enforcement 
of our immigration laws, President Obama's administration filed suit against Arizona, 
asserting the supremacy clause. 
 
20:15:54 
 
And so if you -- believing there should be a national standard for such an issue as 
immigration, I think they're going to have a difficult time not making the same argument 
in reference to the state's choices on marijuana or other drugs.  So it's difficult in our 
society for states to make choices on that particular issue whenever you have an 
overriding federal law.  I think there's going to be a lawsuit, and I think it'll be resolved 
in the courts. 
 
John Donvan: 
Think we have time for one more question.  [unintelligible] 
 
Tatiana Martushev: 
Hi, my name Tatiana Martushev.  I'm in the health care profession. And I mostly deal 
with pain management.  And I have a lot of clients who are getting treatment for cancer, 
and they actually tell me that their doctors say to them, "Listen, the best thing for you is 
actually just go buy some pot because it's actually much more effective in managing the 
pain, it's cheaper than the drugs, it's less destructive on their physical bodies than the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 45 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

medically prescribed drugs, and --" 
 
20:17:04 
 
John Donvan: 
And what is your -- what do you think of -- 
 
Tatiana Martushev: 
So my question is -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But actually what do you think of that answer? 
 
Tatiana Martushev: 
Well, when you see people in that kind of pain, you really don't want them to be in that 
kind of pain, and if the drugs that are legally available aren't really helping them to eat, 
to manage their pain, et cetera, why not give them something that is readily available to 
them if they just walk down the street -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Tatiana Martushev: 
-- and pay someone? 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
[applause] 
 
Take the side arguing against legalization, Asa Hutchinson. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, I mean, any time a doctor or the American Medical Society says a patient needs 
something for pain management, I'll be the first one to sign up for it, I mean, in terms of 
supporting that position.  Doctors in the medical profession should determine what's 
appropriate pain management and care. 
 
20:17:53 
 
At this point, the AMA has not approved that.  Maybe they will someday, but they have 
not done that at this point.  And so that's the answer.  I don't think that relates to the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

overall debate question, but it's certainly an appropriate question to ask. 
 
John Donvan: 
Other side, response? 
 
Paul Butler: 
I had a -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Paul Butler. 
 
Paul Butler: 
-- a member of my family go through the same experience.  He was dying of lung cancer, 
and his doctor told him that marijuana would be the best thing.  He didn't live in a state 
where medical marijuana was available, and so our family faced the difficult choice of 
becoming lawbreakers, risking arrest and prosecution, or watching my relative live and 
die in pain. 
 
John Donvan: 
Asa Hutchinson, just take 20 seconds to do one thing.  You just said that you don't feel 
that that question relates to the motion, and you've said that a few times on a few 
questions.  Why not?  Why not, for example, the question of medical marijuana? 
Marijuana use for medical uses, which would require -- which would involve legalization 
of that particular drug.  Why does that not relate to the motion? 
 
20:19:03 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Well, medical marijuana is a separate and distinct issue.  Some states put medical 
marijuana on the ballot, which takes a doctor's prescription or authorization, and so 
that's not a legalization issue, it is a physician issue and pain management and doctor's 
care, and giving doctors the ability to prescribe marijuana if they believe that's 
beneficial, so it's really a separate medical issue versus the legalization across the board. 
 You can decide they need it for pain management, that doesn't need mean that 
everybody should have marijuana. 
 
John Donvan: 
And the motion does imply all drugs, we're not -- I just want to clarify. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Can I just ask, quickly, though, because these are lengths, I think, in some significant 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

ways.  But when you were the head of the DEA, did you support the federal government 
going in an raiding medical marijuana dispensaries in places like California where it was 
legal under state law to prescribe or to give a doctor's note for -- and if so, why? 
 
20:20:09 
 
John Donvan: 
I don't actually think that that is on point for the debate, so I'm going to pull that one.  
You can answer -- come up and approach him afterwards.  I don't think it's on the 
question of whether we should legalize drugs or not.  And I can take one very, very, 
very, very short question and short answer.  Sir, mic is coming to you down left hand 
side.  Could you stand up?  Thanks. 
 
Male Speaker: 
My name is [unintelligible].  Now, that statistic you provided in the brochure, that 50 
percent decrease in drug use, my question is:  How can you say that that's a causal 
relationship based on the -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  We get the question?  Asa Hutchinson.  Good question. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
I mean, I think you can argue it either way, you can say that that's the result of 
education, it's a result of enforcement efforts.  I personally believe that it's the result of 
all of our community efforts combined. 
 
20:21:03 
 
But the point is, you're not going to ever eliminate 100 percent usage of illegal drugs 
and addicting drugs.  And the reason is we have young people, we have addictive 
personalities.  The question is, what is the best way to keep the usage and the abuse at 
the lowest point for our society?  And I think the present mechanisms, while we can 
tweak it, we can adjust it, we can change our enforcement policies, has worked pretty 
good in terms of keeping it -- a 9 percent level of use in the last 30 days for all of 
Americans.  That's making some progress. 
 
John Donvan: 
And that concludes Round 2 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
And here's where we are.  We are about to hear brief closing statements from each 
debater in turn.  They will be two minutes each, and this is their last chance to try to 
change your minds. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
20:22:00 
 
Remember you voted before the debate and you will be asked to vote again right after 
these closing statements and to pick the winner.  The team that has changed the most 
minds will be declared our winner.  But, first, onto Round 3, closing statements by each 
debater in turn; they are two minutes each.  Our motion is legalize drugs.  And here to 
summarize his position against the motion, Asa Hutchison, former administrator of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration. 
 
Asa Hutchinson: 
Thank you for incredible attention to this important topic.  Today, as I prepared for this 
debate, I received a call from a family friend in Arkansas who is a grown mother, actually 
has two 30-year-old girls, and she said both of them are on methamphetamine and she 
simply asked, "What do I do about it?"  And so I started asking questions, and one of 
them actually knew she had a problem and wants to get off; the other one just is going 
down this path, she's got a supplier, she's got a dealer.  And, of course, I started thinking 
through, "How does legalization impact this very real tragedy that is destroying this 
home and this family?"  And one of the 30 year old daughters has children being 
neglected.  And I could not think of a system of legalization that would make this better, 
because this person that has a problem will never get the treatment necessary in order 
to get over that addiction unless they're confronted with it, and probably from a legal 
standpoint.  It is that officer that will say, "Ma'am, you've got methamphetamine in your 
car.  You need to get help.  We're going to arrest you, or you're going to go to drug 
court.  Something's going to happen.  And that will change their life.  Now, if it's not 
illegal, all that officer can do is say, ma'am, we're going to have to take your children 
away from you.  But you've got a right to keep your methamphetamine.  You've got a 
right to go get some more. You've got a right to continue your abuse pattern. 
 
20:24:05 
 
And this could be multiplied over and over again.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is about 
legalizing drugs.  If you send a signal to our youth of our nation, the next generation, as 
President Barack Obama wants to do, that it is illegal, then usage will stay at a modest 
level, hopefully a declining level.  If you legalize it, usage will go up.  If you believe it is 
harmful, then you should vote no on the proposition.  Thank you very much. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Asa Hutchinson. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Our motion is "legalize drugs."  And here to make his closing statement in support of the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

motion, Paul Butler, Georgetown law professor and former federal prosecutor. 
 
Paul Butler: 
Thanks first to my great partner and my very worthy opponents.  It sounds, though, like 
I was wrong about how Asa would respond to someone who he cares about who has a 
drug problem, because it does sound like he thinks the best thing to do is to call the 
police, because he said that's the only way that they'll get help.  I just fundamentally 
disagree with that.  I don't think that in order to get treated for a drug problem you 
should have to admit that you're a criminal.  I agree with President Obama when he 
said, during the first campaign, that it's blind and counterproductive to lock up 
nonviolent drug offenders.  If it worked, if it got drugs off the street, then maybe I'd 
support it.  But we know that it just doesn't work.  Clarence Thomas, before he became 
the first African-American on the Supreme Court, was a judge in D.C.  And he said, when 
he would look out of the window of his chambers and see all these young black men 
filing into the criminal court in chains, he would think, "There but for the grace of God 
go I."  My friends, the determination of who goes to criminal court in chains should not 
be so fortuitous.  It should not depend so much on the color of your skin or how much 
money your parents make.  As long as it does, we need to legalize drugs. 
 
20:26:09 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Paul Butler. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that is our motion, legalize drugs.  And here to make his closing statement against 
the motion, Theodore Dalrymple.  He is a former prison doctor and the Dietrich 
Weissman fellow at the Manhattan Institute. 
 
Theodore Dalrymple: 
Well, ladies and gentlemen, first, let me just remind you that Amsterdam is by far the 
most violent city in Western Europe, with a murder rate between 2.5 and 3 times higher 
than that of Paris, for example.  And the mayor of Amsterdam recently said that he 
wanted to reinstate the coffee houses because he had this idea that the one and a half 
people who go there to take cannabis every year, they would go rampaging through the 
streets if they couldn't get it.  I don't think anyone would have said that about smokers, 
for example, who couldn't smoke in bars. 
 
20:27:01 
 
So this suggests that there's a big difference here, a cultural difference.  To give you an 
idea of the -- the Utopianism that is behind this motion, let me tell you that the head of 
the drug agency of the United Nations once said that the drugs trade was corrupting 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

West Africa.  Now, if you can believe that, you can believe anything, because when I 
arrived in Lagos Airport, the first time I arrived in Lagos Airport, the customs officer said, 
have you brought any presents?  I said, I don't know anybody in Nigeria.  He said, "For 
me."  And I soon got the general view.  Crime is not caused by the illegality of drugs, nor 
is there illegality that causes the problems to which they give rise.  If you vote for this 
motion, you're saying that the British were the heroes of the opium wars because they 
opened to the Chinese the freedom to take opium. 
 
20:27:58 
 
And which they then did on a famous or notoriously large scale.  And they stopped 
actually when Mao Tse-Tung threatened to shoot them.  If you believe that the British 
were liberating the Chinese, then you will vote for this motion.  But remember that 
genies do not go back into the bottles when they are commanded to do so.  So please 
vote against the motion. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Theodore Dalrymple. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Our motion is legalize drugs.  And here to make his closing statement in support of the 
motion, Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason.com and Reason TV. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Let me suggest, contra the opposition, when you consider about legalizing drugs, that in 
fact it does increase your freedom to be allowed to take Lexapro, or to take Lipitor or to 
take LSD.  It will not destroy you.  I will not turn you into a fried brain, lesser son of 
Timothy Leary.  It just might make your life a little more interesting, or it's an experience 
worth having.  
 
20:29:07 
 
The status quo in the drug war is untenable and destructive for all of the reasons that 
my partner outlined.  It is always going to be prosecuted.  The drug war is always going 
to be prosecuted against blacks in America, to bring it back to Dear Old Blighty, blacks in 
America and the drug war are what Australians were to the English in World War I.  They 
are human fodder, and they will be ground up and used as -- their bones will be the 
basis for the next bunker.  There is no way around it.  The drug war has always been 
prosecuted along racial lines, along class lines and other discriminatory practices.  That's 
not going to change.  It's not going to get better in the second hundred years of drug 
prohibition.

20:29:51 
 
More to the point, I want you to think about, as you think about legalizing drugs, 
recognize, “is use the same as abuse?”, because that's the underlying kind of premise of 
the anti-legalization movement, to say, you know, marijuana use might go up, so what? 
 If it's not bad, if it's no different than taking a beer -- if it's not qualitatively different 
than having a beer or a martini, maybe that's not such a bad thing, especially because 
people who are high on pot are less antisocial and less destructive and less criminal in 
general than people who are hopped up on a cosmo-tini or something like that.  In the 
end, the legalization movement is a movement for personal responsibility where we 
criminalize bad behavior but not arbitrary substances.  So please, legalize drugs. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Nick Gillespie. 
 
Nick Gillespie: 
Legalize more drugs. 
 
[applause] 
 
20:30:47 
 
John Donvan: 
And that concludes our closing statements.  And now it is time to learn which side you 
feel has argued the best.  We're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your 
seat.  And I'm going to restate the motion and see where you stand now after hearing 
the arguments.  Our motion is, "legalize drugs."  Push number one if you agree with the 
motion, two if you disagree, and three if you became or remain undecided. 
 
Anybody need more time?  Just call out.  No?  All right.  So we'll have the results in 
about 45 seconds or a minute. 
 
 
First of all, I just want to -- I just want to thank the level of debate we heard here 
tonight.  I really appreciated that these two teams respected one another, appreciated 
one another.  It was forceful but friendly.  So congratulations to them for the way they 
did this.

ones that didn't get through and people I didn't call on, thank you very much for

John Donvan: 
So this is our fall season.  We have one more event in our fall season.  And that will be 
coming up on -- December 5th, okay.  Thank you.  It's December 5th.  Even in the room 
knew that but me.   The upcoming debate is called the -- the motion is "science refutes 
religion."  “God.”  Boy, you people --

[laughter] 
 
Can I sit there? 
 
[laughter] 
 
And all of you come up here.  Thank you.  Science refutes God.  And the team arguing 
for the motion includes Lawrence Krauss -- I'm back on script.  Lawrence Kraus.  He is 
professor of physics at the school of earth and space exploration at Arizona state.  His 
partner is Michael Shermer who is the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine.  And 
arguing against the motion that science refutes God, Ian Hutchinson, who is professor of 
nuclear science and engineering at MIT.  His partner is Dinesh d’Souza, the best selling 
author of "What's So Great About Christianity?" tickets for this debate are available for 
our website, that is www.IQ2US.org.  Our next season begins in January.  Five more 
debates coming up.  We start on Wednesday, January 16.  That will be here at 
Kauffman.  Topics and debaters are being worked on still, but they will be posted on our 
website next month.

If you can't be in the audience for any of those upcoming debates, there are a lot of 
other ways to catch them.  I talked about some of them at the beginning, but you can 
watch the live stream on fora.tv.  You can listen to the debates on NPR, WNYC here in 
New York.  You can download them as a podcast or watch them on WNET and the World 
Digital Channel.  Again, if you would like to tweet about the debate, we would love that. 
 We read them all.  The twitter handle is @IQ2US, and the hash tag for this debate was 
DrugDebate. 
 
All right, so here come the final results.  All right, so remember, we've asked you to vote 
twice, once before the debate, and once again after the debate, where you stand on this 
motion before you hear the arguments and afterwards, and the team that has changed

its number -- the team that has changed its results by the largest percentage will be 
declared our winner.  So here was the motion, "Legalize drugs." 
 
20:34:53 
 
Before the debate, 45 percent agreed with the motion, 23 percent were against, and 32 
percent were undecided.  After the debate, let's go first to the team arguing for the 
motion.  Their second vote was 58 percent, 45 up to 58 percent.  That is a move of 13 
percent.  That's what needs to be beaten.  The team against the motion, their first vote 
was 23 percent, the second vote was 30 percent.  They've only gone up 7 percent.  It is 
not enough.  The team -- debate goes to the other side.  Our winners, the team arguing 
in favor of the motion, "Legalize drugs."  Our congratulations to them.  Thank you from 
me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. where we like to say, "Think twice."
