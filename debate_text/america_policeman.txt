MORLEY SAFER 

I’d like to introduce Robert Rosenkranz, Chairman of the 

Rosenkranz Foundation, the sponsor of Intelligence Squared, 

who will frame tonight’s debate.  [APPLAUSE]   

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Thank you, Morley.  And thank all of you for braving the rather 

forbidding elements tonight.  With me is Dana Wolfe, our 

Executive Producer.  Well, tonight’s debate reflects what will 

almost certainly be a major theme in the upcoming Presidential 

election, particularly if Barack Obama’s momentum and 

fundraising prowess carry him to the Democratic nomination.  

We can expect campaigns that reflect stark differences in views 

about America’s military engagement with the world.  Each of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 2. 

 

 

 

these views has a long political pedigree – antecedents ranging 

from Jeffersonian isolationism, Hamilton’s economic liberalism, 

Jackson’s muscular populism and Wilson’s humanitarian 

idealism.  Each would come to very different conclusions on 

tonight’s resolution.  Among the arguments that America should 

be the world’s policeman are:  Who else will protect the peaceful 

from the ruthless, especially the ruthlessness of Islamic 

radicalism.   Who else will cope with nuclear proliferation or 

threats to the world oil supply.  The U.N. has proven useless.  

NATO is too unwieldy and has under-invested in its militaries for 

decades.  Only the U.S. has the capability to lead and to act.   

 

The counter-argument is that no single nation is fit for the role of 

global policeman – certainly not an over-stretched and 

economically challenged America, an America with a deeply 

flawed intelligence operation, ineffective public diplomacy and 

only a superficial understanding of other cultures.   Police are 

viewed skeptically and for good reason, particularly if there are 

no international institutions to check their power.  We need a 

multilateral approach for legitimacy and to be successful.  So 

these are the two arguments that are going to be elaborated on by 

a wonderful panel of speakers that I’m particularly proud of.  And 

I’m pleased to turn the evening over now to our moderator, 

Morley Safer.  Morley has received many awards for his long and

distinguished career in broadcast journalism.  He’s been a 

correspondent on 60 Minutes for CBS since 1970.  So this is his 

thirty-eighth year on the show this season.  Morley, the evening 

is yours.    

MORLEY SAFER 

Thank you, Bob.  [APPLAUSE]  I’d like to welcome you to the 

seventh debate of the second Intelligence Squared U.S. series.  

The resolution being debated tonight is:  America should be the 

world’s policeman.  And let me give you a brief run down of the 

rules of the game.  Members of each team will alternate in 

presenting their side of the argument.  Presentations are limited 

to seven minutes.  When opening arguments are complete I will 

open up the floor to brief questions from the audience.  After the 

Q&A each debater will make a final two minute summation.  And 

finally, you will vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad attached 

to the armrest of your seat and I will announce your decision on 

which side carried the day.  Let’s start with a pre-debate vote.  

You should have one of these.  Pick it up.  It should be attached 

to the armrest on your left.  And for audience members sitting 

along the aisle, to my right, your keypad is attached to the 

armrest on your right side next to your neighbor’s.  Again, 

tonight’s resolution is:  America should be the world’s policeman.  

After my prompt please press one to vote for the motion, two to 

vote against the motion or three if you’re undecided.  You may

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 4. 

 

 

 

begin voting now.  [PAUSE]  Everyone voted?  Okay, I will 

announce the result of your vote later on in the evening.  I’d now, 

now like to introduce the panel, and please hold your applause 

until all six are introduced.  For the motion, a Fellow in National 

Security Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Max Boot, 

professor of American Foreign Policy at the Johns Hopkins 

University School of Advanced International Studies, Michael 

Mandelbaum, and author, commentator and director of the 

Centre for Social Cohesion, Douglas Murray.   And to my left, 

against the motion, president and founder of the Eurasia Group, 

Ian Bremmer, President and CEO of the Henry L. Stimson Center 

Ellen Laipson, and writer for the Times of London and the 

Spectator, then broadcaster for the BBC and a former British 

Member of Parliament, Matthew Parris.  [APPLAUSE]  We will 

start with Max Boot voting for the motion.    

MAX BOOT 

Thank you very much.  And first I’d like to thank Bob and 

Alexandra and Dana for the terrific job they’ve done in turning 

this debate series into reality.  And I’d like to thank all of you for 

showing up on such a miserable evening to hear a debate about 

what I do think is one of the most important issues that we could 

possibly talk about.   No doubt many of you are asking 

yourselves tonight, why should America take on the thankless 

task of policing the globe.  To answer that question, start by 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 5. 

 

 

 

asking, does the world need a policeman.   That’s like asking 

whether New York City needs a police force.  As long as evil 

exists, someone will have to protect peaceful people from 

predators.  The international system is no different in this regard 

from your own neighborhood, except that predators abroad are 

far more dangerous than ordinary robbers, rapists and 

murderers.   They are, if given half a chance, mass robbers, mass 

rapists, mass murderers.  Without an effective police force the 

world community would fall apart faster, and more completely 

than New York City did in the 1970s.    

 

There are to be sure lots of international laws on the books 

prohibiting genocide, landmines, biological weapons and other 

nasty things.  But without enforcement mechanisms they are as 

worthless as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which outlawed war as an 

instrument of national policy, 11 years before the Vermacht 

rolled into Poland.   The hope of idealistic liberals for more than a 

century has been that some international organization would 

punish the wicked.  But the League of Nations was a dismal 

failure, and the UN is not much better.   The best multilateral 

alternative is probably NATO.  But from Bosnia to Afghanistan we 

have seen time and again that NATO has trouble acting 

effectively.  In fact five retired NATO generals have just issued a 

report that bemoans the absence of a properly defined political 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 6. 

 

 

 

objective, the absence of an integrated strategy to achieve that 

objective, and the absence of capabilities to implement the 

strategy.   Now that doesn’t mean we should abandon NATO.  It 

does mean we should have no illusions that its European 

members can fend for themselves.  So who does that leave to be 

the world’s policeman.  Belgium, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, 

Bangladesh?    

 

I think the answer’s pretty obvious.  It’s the country with the 

most vibrant economy, the most fervent devotion to liberty, and 

the most powerful military.  In the 19th century, Great Britain 

battled enemies of all mankind such as slave traders and pirates, 

preserved the balance of power on the continent, and kept the 

world’s seas open to commerce.   Today the only nation that can 

play an equivalent role is the United States of America.  Allies will 

be needed, but America is, as Madeline Albright said, the 

indispensable nation.  Now skeptics will reply that America has 

an isolationist past, and no desire to past globo-cop.  But rumors 

of American isolationism are greatly exaggerated.   Since the 

earliest days of the republic American traders, missionaries and 

soldiers have penetrated the farthest corners of the world, and 

they have a long history of upholding civilized norms.   I am 

reminded in fact of the words spoken 104 years ago, by a great 

New Yorker.  He said, “Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 7. 

 

 

 

which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, 

may ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation.    

 

And in the Western Hemisphere, the adherence of the United 

States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, 

however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or 

impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.”   

Now when Teddy Roosevelt spoke those words, the Western 

Hemisphere was the only place where the US exercised military 

hegemony.  Today America exercises almost as much power 

everywhere around the world, as we once had only the 

Caribbean.   In fact we have more power than any other state in 

history.  Thus, by Roosevelt’s logic the US is obligated to defend 

civilization, and that is precisely what we are doing.  That is why 

American troops have fought in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, 

Afghanistan and Iraq to up—restore the rule of law and uphold 

human rights.   That is why American troops are still stationed 

from South Korea to Germany, to prevent aggression and a 

return of dangerous rivalries.  That is why the US Navy patrols 

the world’s oceans, to prevent the closing of checkpoints at— 

chokepoints, such as the Straits of Hormuz.    

 

And that’s why numerous agencies of the US government work to 

combat terrorism, and to stop the spread of weapons of mass 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 8. 

 

 

 

destruction.  That is what being the world’s policeman is all 

about.  Of course we cannot right every wrong, nor intervene 

everywhere.   We have to use prudence and judgment in the 

exercise of our power, something we have not always done in 

recent years.  But America’s occasional missteps should not lead 

us to abdicate our indispensable role, any more than the NYPD 

should stop doing its vital work, simply because cops 

occasionally do the wrong thing.   On balance, the NYPD still 

does far more good than harm, and so does the United States of 

America.  In fact America has been the greatest force for good in 

the world in the past century.  Just think of what happened when 

we did not act as globo-cop.   Think of what happened in 1914, in 

1939.  By contrast, think of what happened when we did act as 

globo-cop.  Think of what happened in 1945, and 1989.  

American intervention made possible the defeat of Nazism, and 

Communism.  American isolationism made possible the outbreak 

of two world wars.    

 

As these examples demonstrate, there is nothing altruistic about 

our globo-cop role.  As the world’s most prosperous country, and 

as a country that depends for its prosperity on the free flow of 

people, capital and products, we are the biggest beneficiaries of 

the liberal international order that we safeguard.   Compared 

with the benefits that we gain the financial costs are trivial.  We 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 9. 

 

 

 

currently spend 4% of our GPD on defense, a lot less than the 

average during the past four decades.  That 4 cents on the dollar 

preserving international peace and stability is a bargain.   Now I 

imagine that the other side will claim that our international 

policing function makes us hated, and leads to greater violence 

against us.  That is sometimes the case and I will be the first to 

admit it.  But we are as often reviled for not acting, for not 

stopping the genocide in Rwanda or Darfur, for not imposing 

peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.   And yes, there is a 

cost to be paid for action, as we’ve learned in Iraq.   

MORLEY SAFER 

One minute—    

MAX BOOT 

But there is also a cost to be paid for inaction.  During the 1990s 

we ignored our policing responsibilities in Afghanistan.  As the 

civil war raged between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance, 

our leaders said in essence what Britain’s leaders said in the 

1930s—that there is no reason to be concerned about a quarrel 

in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing.   

Well on 9-11 we found out why we should care.  The answer can 

be seen a few miles from here, where the World Trade Center 

once stood.  9-11 should’ve taught us that we cannot ignore 

potential peril, nor count on others to protect us.   We must 

safeguard ourselves, and not simply by launching retaliatory

strikes after thousands, perhaps millions have perished.  We 

need to play a proactive role.  We need to police areas of unrest, 

and to do what we can to bring decent government to war-torn 

lands.   If we fail to act, we, as the mightiest nation in the world, 

will pay the heaviest price.  I therefore urge you to heed Theodore 

Roosevelt’s admonition, and to vote in favor of America exercising 

an international police power.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]   

MORLEY SAFER 

Against the motion, we’ll begin with Ian Bremmer.  [PAUSE]  No, 

I’m sorry, I am sorry…  [LAUGHTER]  Okay.  I should sure this, 

can’t I—   

ELLEN LAIPSON 

Okay?  Well, good evening, everyone, I’m not Ian Bremmer, I’m 

Ellen, and I rise to oppose the notion that the US should be the 

world’s policeman.  The United States indisputably has a vital 

role to play in world affairs, we have unique qualities for 

leadership.   At present, perhaps not as a permanent state of 

affairs, some of this unique role is circumstantial because our 

only peer adversary for over half a century is no more.  Some of it 

is inherent in our qualities.  The size of our country, the wealth 

that we enjoy, and the talent of our people.   We can influence 

world affairs, both by conscious decisions that our governments 

make, by our society’s desire to respond to humanitarian 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 11. 

 

 

 

disasters, and in positions that we take in multilateral 

negotiations and in regional organizations.   Americans for the 

most part do want to be active on the world stage.  But we can do 

good in the world, and we can benefit as a society, from active 

engagement in the world, without being the world’s policeman.  

Let’s talk some definitions.    

 

Now, I don’t know whether the organizers of this debate meant 

“police” in a literal sense.  But let’s take the word “police” at three 

different levels.  First would be “police” as in a demand for 

someone to enforce the rules, not make the rules, but enforce 

them.   So who do you—when you’re in trouble, call 911, the 

police come.  So that’s the kind of bottom-level, literal definition 

of, of policeman in this case.  We could also think of the world’s 

policeman as a metaphor for a security provider in much broader 

dimensions.   Who sets the laws and enforces them.  This would 

be a reference to the hegemonic stability system that we’ve 

known internationally since World War II, that would refer to for 

example America’s military presence in East Asia, or in the role 

that we played when we finally decided to topple the Taliban in 

Afghanistan.    

 

And then there’s a third definition that’s perhaps a little more 

abstract.  “Policeman” as a surrogate for any use of force, or for a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 12. 

 

 

 

monopoly on the use of force, including going to war, preemptive 

wars, preventive wars.   We decided Saddam Hussein had to go, 

we made the rule for ourself [sic], it wasn’t a rule for anybody 

else, it was just for us.  So that’s a third definition of “the world’s 

policeman.”  So I oppose this motion and I hope you will agree 

with me, for several reasons.   First let’s take some practical 

reasons.  The US is a country, not a global government.  We have 

to know our limits.  The United States should use force when it’s 

in our interest, just like every other country has to make 

existential decisions about the use of force and about war and 

peace.   If we step up to the role of the world’s policeman we 

would be committing to act and to put our soldiers and police 

and our citizens in harm’s way where U.S. interests may be very 

modest.  Do we want to assume responsibility to go anywhere 

anytime?  A second practical argument is that we can’t do it.  

And here I mean both in terms of quantity and quality.  Quantity:  

guess how many of the eleven thousand police who are currently 

deployed worldwide in U.N. operations are American?  Out of 

eleven thousand, two hundred and ninety-one are U.S. 

policemen.  And they are in Kosovo and Haiti, principally.  So the 

U.S. has not provided robust manpower from our police forces.  

We’ve also learned that the way we train our policemen in a 

federal system is not all that well suited to the requirements for 

police in a lot of peace operations post-conflict.  And then let’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 13. 

 

 

 

ask literally, are we capable of doing the job?  Can we be the beat 

cop that Max talked about?  Do we know the neighborhood?  Do 

we speak the language?  Do we know the culture so that we can 

diffuse conflict before it breaks into violence?  I’m not so sure 

about that.  It turns out that a lot of other countries, by the way, 

are willing to train their citizens and deploy them to be policemen 

in such circumstances – the South Asians, the Australians, the 

Canadians and the Nordics, in particular.   

 

A third practical reason is that I’m not sure the American people 

want us to play this role alone.  There is a deep belief that the 

security burdens in the world need to be shared and that not all 

security problems affect American interests.  We need to make 

choices.  Polls show that Americans want to respond when there 

are humanitarian requirements, et cetera, but they don’t want to 

do it alone.  Now, I’m not going to make the cost argument 

because I actually don’t think it’s the most persuasive one.  The 

U.S. does still contribute twenty-five percent of the U.N.’s costs to 

deploy forces around the world but we are behind in our dues.  

And before we criticize the U.N., I think we better decide whether 

the under-funding of some of the U.N.’s activities are, in fact, 

because we haven’t paid our, our fair share.   

 

Second set of arguments I want to make against this motion are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 14. 

 

 

 

political ones.  And here basically it’s two arguments.  One is an 

argument about today, the particular moment that we’re in.  And 

another is an argument about the horizon, about the future.  I 

think today we have a particular problem trying to assert that we 

could or should be the world’s policeman.  We have over-used 

our global leadership role.  We have abused, in a way, the, the 

good will of the international community by deciding that we 

knew better than anyone how to bring security to dangerous 

parts of the world.  And it turned out we weren’t as good at it as 

we thought we would be.  We have not necessarily made – at least 

the key, Iran and Afghan…Iraq and Afghanistan – more secure or 

more stable.  This is not the moment to reassert the policeman’s 

role.   

MORLEY SAFER 

 [OVERLAP]  One minute.    

ELLEN LAIPSON  

A third set of arguments – at the horizon my argument is that 

there is a realignment of power in the 21st Century.  Other 

countries are rising.  This does not mean that the United States 

is in decline.  It does not mean that we’re weak.  But other 

countries are rising and it’s a good moment to try to reallocate 

some of the responsibilities for these activities.  I have a third, a 

last argument, which is a philosophical one.   I think it would 

behoove American society and the long term interests of the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 15. 

 

 

 

American people if we would take a more nuanced and 

egalitarian sense of our place in the world.  In the age of 

globalization we’ve benefited at least as much as everybody else.   

 

But we have to be, we have to start to recognize that other people 

are good at this game too, and that we have to have more respect 

for the capacity of others to contribute to the global commons.  

So what I advocate is a multilateral approach to the security 

needs of the international community.  I want an integrated 

approach that doesn’t look just at the security aspects of some of 

these problems but weaves together cultural, political and 

economic dimensions of policy responses.  And I want us to care 

a lot more about the legitimacy of how we engage internationally, 

particularly since, as the world becomes more democratic –  

MORLEY SAFER 

[OVERLAP]  Time is up, Ms. Laipson.    

ELLEN LAIPSON  

Okay, thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]    

MORLEY SAFER  

And now for the resolution, Michael Mandelbaum.   

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM 

Thank you.  You will observe that some of the things that I have 

to say overlap some of the things that Max Boot said.  This is so, I 

daresay, not only because great minds run in the same channel, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 16. 

 

 

 

but also because the things on which we agree are true.  

[LAUGHTER]  All societies, when they become sufficiently 

interdependent, need governance.  The society of states, the 

society of sovereign countries has reached that point.  The 

international society needs governance and the United States 

provides it.  The United States provides to other countries some, 

although not all, of the services that governments provide within 

the countries that they govern.  This, as it happens, is the thesis 

of my 2006 book, The Case for Goliath:  How America Acts as the 

World’s Government in the 21st Century, that the organizers have 

very kindly provided outside this room.  [AUDIENCE REACTION] 

Hmm. [PAUSE]   

 

The United States provides order to the world, as governments 

must, in two ways.  First, economic activity within countries 

requires a secure backdrop.  Government protects commerce and 

enforces contracts.  The United States does this in the global 

economy.  American military deployments and the American 

alliance systems assure the free flow of trade and the movement 

of capital across borders.  This economic activity known as 

globalization, and made possible by the American role as the 

world’s police force, has brought benefits to hundreds of millions 

of people.  Second, the United States helps keep order in the 

world by leading the effort to keep weapons of mass destruction 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 17. 

 

 

 

out of the hands of groups or individuals that would deploy them 

in ways antithetical to the interests not only of the United States, 

but of the world in general.  The United States leads the effort at 

global nuclear non-proliferation.  And in these two ways above 

all, the United States acts as the world’s police force.   

 

Now, to this argument at least three objections may be made.  

And we’ve already heard one of them.  One objection is that the 

United States does not carry out its policing duties as well as it 

should.  As Ellen Laipson said, the United States is not present 

everywhere and doesn’t act perfectly.  And this is certainly true, 

but neither does any police force.  Every police force is subject to 

criticism, legitimate criticism.  But criticizing a police force is not 

the same thing as arguing that there should not be one.  A 

second objection to the motion is that it would be better if global 

policing were carried out, not by the United States, but by other 

countries or groups of countries or international organizations.   

 

Now, I daresay if the proposition were put that way to the 

American public a majority of them might agree.  But it is the 

fact, as Max Boot noted, that there is no other country or group 

of countries that is willing or able to take up the burden of global 

policing.  And as for international organizations, they are far too 

feeble to do so, and that emphatically includes the international 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 18. 

 

 

 

organization to which some would like to assign the task of global 

policing – the one whose headquarters is located a few blocks 

from here – the United Nations.  So the alternative to the United 

States as the world’s policeman is not a better international 

order.  It is more international disorder.  Well, a third objection 

is, what about Iraq?  Well, the American military operations in 

Iraq really have two parts.  The first part involved removing a 

tyrannical government and insuring that neither it nor a 

tyrannical successor would possess weapons of mass 

destruction.   

 

The second part of the operation involves trying to construct a 

stable, decent democratic government in that country.  The first 

task which falls within the purview of global policing was 

successfully accomplished.  The second has not been done so 

successfully.  But the second task – what’s wrongly called nation 

building and should be called state building – is not an example 

of police work.  It’s an example of social work.  The United States 

is not good at social work but it doesn’t have to be to perform as 

the world’s police force.  So to oppose this motion you must 

believe one or both of two things.  You must believe either that 

the world does not need policing or that there is some better 

source of global policing than the United States.  There is, I 

submit, no reason to believe either.  And I will add, by way of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 19. 

 

 

 

conclusion, that there is one group of people with a keen interest 

in global order and extensive familiarity with the American role in 

the world that emphatically does not believe either proposition.   

 

I refer to the world’s governments.  They could, if they chose, 

circumscribe or abolish altogether by banding together to oppose 

it, the American role as the world’s policeman.  But they have 

done and shown no signs of doing any such thing.  And the 

reason is that they understand and appreciate the benefits that 

America’s role as the global policeman confers upon their 

countries and on the world as a whole.  So whatever the verdict of 

the people in this house, the governments of the world above all, 

by what they have not done, have voted in favor of this motion.  

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]    

MORLEY SAFER  

Against the motion, uh, Matthew Parris.   

MATTHEW PARRIS 

[PAUSE]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was touched by what Max 

Boot, [LAUGHTER]  Max Boot said about the excellence of the 

British empire and British imperialism in the 19th and early 20th 

Century.  I'm old enough – he’s not – to remember that that was 

not the American attitude towards British imperialism, even in 

the 1950s and the 1960s.  What happens when any one nation 

tries to assert, coercively, its predominance over the rest of the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.-

world is that other nations begin to gang up against them.  And 

in that case the United States was part of the group that ganged 

up against the British empire.  It might be fair, it might not be 

fair.  But it will always happen and it’s something to which I want 

to return.  But first – and if you’ll forgive me that spirit of malice 

which I find rescues these occasions from the horrors of 

constructive debate, may, may I, --  [LAUGHTER]  I say what a 

privilege it, it is to find ranged, against me three of the finest 

minds it’s possible to locate among protagonists for a doomed 

cause.  [LAUGHTER]   

 

One of my fellow countrymen, Douglas Murray’s precocious 

genius – well, few on the British, the thinking British right have 

not heard of Douglas Murray’s genius.  I have to tell you, ladies 

and gentlemen, that he has taken elements in Britain quite by 

storm.  One commentator praises him as the right’s answer to 

Michael Moore, God help us.  [LAUGHTER]  His unkinder critics 

have suggested – I, I think in jest -- that when younger he had a 

brief flirtation with the Baptist Church.  Only on discovering that 

baptism by total immersion meant disappearing entirely from the 

public view for all of thirty seconds, made [LAUGHTER]  Mr. 

Murray relent.  Max Boot appeared last year on a list of the Five 

Hundred Most Influential Foreign Policy Thinkers.  We, on this 

side of the debate, do not dispute Mr. Boot’s influence on foreign

policy thinking any more than we dispute the influence of Donald 

Rumsfeld or King George the III.  [LAUGHTER]    

 

Both Murray and Boot and Michael Mandelbaum, too clever for 

the mob on their own side, represent one of the most interesting 

political experiments in outsourcing ever conducted -- U.S. 

conservatism’s franchising out to experts of its higher mental 

faculties.  [LAUGHTER]   Their function, they’re a kind of 

priesthood, is to flatter stupider people that there exist higher 

arguments, smarter than they themselves can quite grasp, for 

things that they wanted to do anyway.  They should be here in 

white robes.  Three fine fellows, then – one of them older, one of 

them younger, all of them prettier and all of them cleverer than 

the argument that they represent.  We salute them.  [LAUGHTER]  

Next, to the, to the argument that they represent:  why must 

Washington shun the mantle of world policeman?  For three 

reasons:  First, America can’t; Second, America shouldn’t; and 

Third, Americans won’t embrace this role.    

 

We don’t debate whether Belgium should police the world 

because the possibility does not arise nor does it for America, as 

Ellen Laipson says – not even America.  She is more powerful 

than any but nowhere like more powerful than all of the nations 

of the world.  The point at which the United States most closely

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 22. 

 

 

 

approached political hegemony – military, political and economic 

– was more than half a century ago.  It was at the end of the 

Second World War.  Since then, and despite magnificent growth 

in absolute terms, America has been in almost continuous 

relative decline.  After the implosion of the Soviet Union the 

impression of power vacuum was just a mirage.  It was not a 

vacuum.  It was a fragmentation, as America and my own 

country, Britain, are discovering in Iraq and Afghanistan, where 

we are hopelessly entangled in two quite undeveloped countries, 

both of which I visited since the occupation.   

 

Where are the armies?  Where are the fleets?  Where are the 

treasure chests to finish this job, let alone embark on new 

coercions?  If the predominance of America’s wealth and power in 

comparison with any single rival has misled some into supposing 

that America could out-punch all of them together, it never 

misled cleverer men like Messrs. Boot, Mandelbaum and Murray.  

They have advanced a more subtle theory that if America picked 

on a single miscreant nation and sorted it out by force, then 

mission accomplished – others would learn the lesson.  It’s an 

attractive idea.  It didn’t work – quite the reverse.  It triggered an 

international up-swelling of resentment and resistance.  This has 

weakened America’s greatest resource – good will, her powers of 

persuasion.

Maybe you think the world is judging America unfairly.  I, I think 

the world judged imperial Britain unfairly.  But ask why that 

happens, why that always happen.  And if you want to know the 

answer, ask how Americans would feel if the boot – Max will 

forgive me – were not on the American foot.  Of all people, 

Americans should know that a policeman implements laws made 

by and for the people that he polices, under a government whose 

legitimacy derives from its being their own.  Police other nations 

and there will be no such assumed legitimacy.  Without 

acquiescence you can only impose.  America does not have the 

brute power to impose, nor the right.  I said that not only can 

America not police the world but that she should not.  With 

whatever good will you set out with –

was at school in Swaziland and for two years at Yale University.  I

something different about you.  I think that even if you could 

police the world, I don’t think that Americans want to police the 

world.  I don’t think that Americans are isolationist.  I think that 

on occasions America has to intervene abroad, has to respond, 

has to defend herself.  But I think it’s in the instincts of the 

American people to demand of their statesmen that reasons are 

given for that.  There will never be a long, longstanding will 

among the American people for international intervention.

those people.  I represented them in England.  They are 

conservatives.  You, Max, Douglas and your cartload of doctrine 

and theory, are not.  I beg to oppose the motion.  [APPLAUSE]    

MORLEY SAFER  

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]   Before we continue, I—I have a 

question or two for each side here.  Max Boot, you make the 

case…that the alternative to unilateralism, is isolation.  Whatever 

happened to diplomacy?   

MAX BOOT 

If I gave you the impression that…the alternatives are either 

unilateralism or isolationism I—that’s, that’s false, and in fact I 

tried very hard not to give that impression because what I talked 

about was not necessary unilateralism, it was American global 

leadership, and as I said, we should try to act with allies 

wherever possible.   We should certainly not go it alone unless it’s 

absolutely necessary.  But in certain circumstances it is 

absolutely necessary, and even with allies we cannot simply do 

what the herd wants, we have to provide leadership.  We saw in 

the case of Bosnia for example in the early 1990s what happened 

when American global leadership was absent.   And that was 

genocide occurring and it was only when we stepped forward and 

mobilized our allies in the way that a policeman might mobilize a 

posse that we were able to be effective, so—

MORLEY SAFER  

But the record for intervention is abominable, when you think of 

the intervention in Vietnam.  When we think of the intervention 

in Cuba, I mean the list goes on and on—and, and Chile.   

MAX BOOT 

Well, I would say to you—   

MORLEY SAFER 

And all of those places.    

MAX BOOT 

Well, in the first place—   

MORLEY SAFER 

We are—interventionists we may want to be, but inept we are.    

MAX BOOT 

Well, in fact I would argue that a lot of our interventions have 

worked out reasonably well and I think for example of World War 

II or the Gulf War and more importantly I think of the 

consequences of not in— intervening, for example the fact that 

we did not intervene in Europe in the 1930s, I think that failure 

speaks for itself.    

MORLEY SAFER  

Well, in an age of atomic proliferation, “reasonably well” just isn’t 

good enough, I guess.  Ms. Laipson, you talk about engagement—   

MAX BOOT 

How many debaters do we have on—on the other side there.

[LAUGHTER]    

MORLEY SAFER  

You talk about engagement.  But, in the case of Iran where the 

other side really has no interest in engagement, or North Korea 

has no interest in engagement, I mean, we can be out there 

engaging all we want, and nobody’s accepting the ring.   

ELLEN LAIPSON 

Well I think the North Korea and Iran cases are a category that’s 

a little bit different than the requirement for a policeman, 

although Michael Mandelbaum put non-proliferation inn this 

basket that we’re talking about tonight.   But both of those 

problems are being managed with, you know, international 

cooperation, and even if the United States had—didn’t want to 

engage initially with North Korea, and still today with Iran, the 

reality is we have found interlocutors to engage with both.   And 

the progress has been made in the six-party talks with North 

Korea.  I certainly agree with you that Iran is in one of those, you 

know, very hard baskets, and engagement alone is not 

necessarily sufficient.  There are circumstances in which coercive 

diplomacy, sanctions, there are other instruments of 

international politics that can be, can be exercised.   But I would 

argue that at least under today’s circumstances, you know, Iran 

is not, Iran has many policies that we do not like, but it is not 

playing the role of a belligerent, that requires a military action

right now.   

MORLEY SAFER  

We will continue now with…for the resolution, Douglas Murray.    

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

Okay, thank you, thank you very much, it’s very good to be here.  

And thank you for listening to me, it’s good to be another Brit 

here, partly, partly so that you don’t all think that Brits think like 

Matthew Parris…  [LAUGHTER]  It’s an odd position to be in, 

perhaps some of you think to have somebody from another 

nation coming along to you here and saying, effectively, please 

police me…  A strange misquote of that wonderful thinker 

Engelbert Humperdinck…  [LAUGHTER]  But…  [LAUGHTER]  

But it’s not quite as masochistic as it sounds when we talk about 

the world’s policeman, a lot of people assume up the idea of force, 

and that you have the right to do it because you’re powerful.    

 

I don’t think that is what the reason is, that America has the 

right to be and should continue to be as it currently is the world’s 

policeman.  It’s not your force as a nation which I think allows 

you that right, it’s America’s virtues that allow it that right.  It’s 

the fact that, when America goes into a country like Afghanistan 

or Iraq, you don’t do the things which previous great powers did, 

that the moment, if anything this is a failing, if anything, when 

you go into a country like Iraq, you don’t say how long can we 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 29. 

 

 

 

stay here, but how soon can we get out.   You want to dabble as 

little as possible in the world--I think that’s a virtue.  You know 

when you have to intervene.  But you also know when you have 

to get out.  But, uh, to clear up some of the mistakes from other 

side already, just because you’re the world’s policeman doesn’t 

mean you don’t have allies.  It doesn’t mean you don’t have 

friends and others who will do the job, who’ll join you in the job.   

 

America in the last few years, despite the caricature of her 

greatest enemies, is not the unilateral organization that a lot of 

people would portray her as being.  Now, as my two colleagues 

and comrades on my side have already intimated to you, there 

are really only two reasons not to vote for the right side if I may, 

in this in this motion.   The first is that you think that the world 

does need a policeman, but that someone else can do it.  

Someone else will step up for the job.  We’ve heard quite a lot at 

the moment, uh, from people talking more I think in glee than 

sorrow about the rise of China, for instance.  You can look in 

your papers any day and see what the rise of China would bring 

in its wake if you wanted them to police the world, look at the 

athletes for instance going to the Olympics, being, attempting to 

be forbidden from speaking out about any Chinese abuses whilst 

they’re there.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 30. 

 

 

 

 

You want a perpetual silencing like that across the globe?  You 

don’t see America trying to do that, you don’t see America trying 

to silence her enemies.  America is the only force I can think of 

which tolerates people standing up against it, shouting as loudly 

as possible, picketing its military institutions and all this kind of 

thing permits that.   Think of another world power that would 

permit that kind of thing, or another policeman that wouldn’t 

object when people continue to rejoice in poking it in the eye.  

Who else might be on the horizon?  You might see, there’s a lot of 

talk for instance at the moment about Saudi Arabia.   We have a 

lot of talk about that in Britain at the moment with our 

Archbishop of Canterbury, or soon to be promoted to the Grand 

Mufti of Canterbury.  [LAUGHTER]  Saying that he wouldn’t mind 

Sharia law in Britain, I was sitting opposite a clerical goon two 

mornings ago in London who was explaining to me,  Sheik Sewit 

Hassan [PH], what the sharia that he would like to bring to 

Britain would be and that, yes, we should cut off hands, we 

should stone women to death, because it would teach the others, 

and he hadn’t seen any adultery in Saudi Arabia.  And I pointed 

out you don’t actually often see adultery happening, but—  

[LAUGHTER]   

 

But you might get those kind of global systems if you, if you wish

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.-

it hard enough, if you wish hard enough for America to fall, for 

America to be poked in the eye.  But what will you do, who will 

sort out these problems, who will sort out a problem like Iran, 

when you have years of talks and the only progress you’ll really 

hear of is Iran getting closer and closer to its desired objectives of 

nuclear power.   So that’s the first reason, the first reason why 

you would vote against this motion, the second, is that you think 

that the world doesn’t really need a policeman.  It will be just fine 

without one.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is, I think, a terrible, 

terrible illusion, it’s a siren call which has called across history to 

people.   It called to the people of Athens two and a half millennia 

ago when Demosthenes warned them of the threat from King 

Phillip and said you do have other people who will tell you, if you 

ignore this threat, you will save money, and you’ll be able to 

spend it on other things…    

 

But, I know that if you listen to them, you will one day wake up, 

and you’ll realize how much this optimism cost you.  You’re in 

the same position today, ladies and gentlemen.  As people have 

been throughout history, as the person—the famous journalist 

who before the First World War wrote that, war in Europe was 

now an impossibility, because it was so economically unviable.   

Well it turned out to be more unviable for more reason than 

economics and people did it anyway.  You will not be able to live 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 32. 

 

 

 

in a world in which no one acts as your policeman.  And let me 

cite one example of where the virtue of American intervention has 

been cited already by Max Boot, is not only necessary but vital 

and I’d cite the case of Kosovo.   This might well come back again 

and again later.  But, when the concentration camps in Europe 

reopened in the 1990s in the Balkans, and when we saw an 

ethnic genocide, an ethnic cleansing, from a third-rate tin-pot 

dictator and the European governments couldn’t stop it, who was 

it who had to stop in.   

MORLEY SAFER

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

It wasn’t France, France provided us with a phalanx of lawyers, 

and a leak.  America provided us with 98% of the world—the air 

power, and they stopped a genocide, that’s no small achievement, 

ladies and gentlemen, I will—could go through all of the things 

which Ellen Laipson said, of the problems that you have 

enforcing, as nobody says that it’s good being the world’s 

policeman, nobody says it’s enjoyable, nobody would want the 

job.  Other than people who you wouldn’t want to have the job.  

And, if Matthew Parris—  It’s always wary when somebody opens 

with compliments.  [LAUGHTER]   Mr. Parris describes my cause, 

our side’s cause, “I think your cause is a doomed cause.”  If it 

were a doomed cause, ladies and gentlemen, if my cause were a

Thank you.

MORLEY SAFER  

Now, against the resolution, Ian Bremmer.    

IAN BREMMER 

Good evening.  Delighted to be here.  Let me first say I fully 

expected in a couple of minutes when we see the numbers for 

and against the motion that I’m against the motion, I expect most 

of you are against the motion.  When we vote at the end, I know a 

lot of you, if it’s really skewed on the side of being against the 

motion are gonna want to give these guys a couple of votes.   It’s 

kinda like wanting to vote for Huckabee right now.  [LAUGHTER]  

He’s still in the game.  And there’s stylishness and you kinda 

want to give him a little something for being in the game and 

taking the side.  But we all know we can’t get there.   And that’s 

where I am, look, Michael Mandelbaum made very clear that 

there are only two ways you can agree with me.  Number one, you 

have to believe that the world doesn’t need a global policeman, or 

number two, that there is a better system out there than having a 

global policeman.  That’s spoken like a true academic.   

 

I agree with both of those things.  I think the world does need a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 34. 

 

 

 

global policeman, I think it would be the best system if the US 

was…the global policeman.  But I also think we are incapable, 

and unprepared to do it.  So, I’m trying to be a realist.  I’m trying 

to look at what we can actually do, the limitations of our power, 

look, I need a loving family, but my mom and dad died of cancer, 

I’m sorry, I’m not gonna get there.  That’s kind of—it’s true, but 

it’s—I’m not looking for sympathy.  My point is, we’re just—or 

laughter.   But we’re, we’re not going to get there.  And that’s 

really the crux of my argument, now, let me make a couple of 

points here.  The first is I fully agree with the notion that the 

world desperately needs leadership.  We are in a situation where 

global architecture is not catching up to the radical change in 

geopolitical shift.   

 

The United States doesn’t have the lifting power it used to, 

China’s growing like crazy.  Energy’s increasingly coming from 

unstable parts of the world.  NATO’s ineffectual.  Security 

Council’s ineffectual, the proliferation regime is broken.  Don’t 

even get me started on climate change.   Lord knows, you need a 

leader, to take advantage of this, and to move the system in the 

direction that we will all be able to live more secure, more 

prosperous lives.  I do believe the United States needs to fill as 

much of that void as possible, the United States needs to be a 

global leader.  Condi Rice said as much at Davos a couple weeks 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 35. 

 

 

 

ago.  The Russians strongly disagreed, they said the world does 

not need a conductor for the orchestra.  And then Shimon Peres, 

the closest to Henry Kissinger on the panel, said, what we really 

need is a composer.  Not a leader.   

 

And I think the world does need a leader.  I think a policeman is 

a very different fact on the ground, look.  When we talk about a 

policeman I think about enforcement, and I think about Max 

Boots on the ground.  I don’t think we have the political will in 

this country, I don’t think we have the political capital in this 

country, and I think trying to argue that we do, risks a growth of 

anti-Americanism abroad.   But more importantly and more 

dangerously, it risks a rise of protectionism in the United States, 

it risks a rise of neo-isolationism in the United States.  Look at 

the Pew polls, look at how Americans increasingly feel about 

support for free trade.   Look at how they increasingly feel about 

whether or not they believe America has benefited from the way 

the world system is evolving, they don’t.  Part of the reason they 

don’t, I suspect, is because folks in the Ninth Ward in New 

Orleans don’t feel like they’re doing as well as they should.   And 

they don’t necessary like the idea of giving billions of dollars of 

aid after a tsunami in Indonesia when we can’t build our own 

homes in New Orleans.  I am not suggesting we shouldn’t be 

giving the billions of dollars in aid, I firmly believe we should.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 36. 

 

 

 

 

But I think that taking on the role of global policeman creates far 

more sentiment in the United States in opposing the world of 

good the United States does and should continue to do.  Let me 

be specific on a couple of issues.  Iran.  The United States 

desperately needs to help reduce the threat of Iran.   How might 

we do that?  Effective sanctions?  Look at who provides refined 

product to Iran, from around the world, it’s not the United States.  

It’s the Europeans, it’s the Indians.  You want to be a global 

policeman on Iran, you better get their support.   How about 

shutting down their accounts, the accounts of the Quds force, 

um, or of the Revolutionary Guard.  Better get support from 

Dubai.  It’s not the United States.  The US in a globalized world 

can’t act as a global policeman, with one of the most important 

conflicts facing us today.   

 

Lord knows they’d like to try, but unless you’re arguing that this 

is gonna be the next American military intervention— and there 

doesn’t seem to be much direct support for that even among the 

most ardent neoconservatives in the United States—you’ve got a 

serious problem.  How about a place where we can’t even argue 

about military support, how about North Korea.  The United 

States said, if the North Koreans develop a nuclear weapon, we 

are gonna be very, very angry.  [LAUGHTER]  And the North 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 37. 

 

 

 

Koreans tested a nuclear weapon, and you know what, the anger 

in Washington was palpable.   But we didn’t do anything, and we 

went back to the Chinese, and the Chinese said, we told you you 

don’t have a military options, sanctions aren’t gonna work, now 

let’s sit down at the table and work with them.  The United States 

said yeah, you’re right, okay, we’ll sit down and we’ll talk to you.   

At the end of the day, I’d love to be in a position where the 

Americans could be the global policemen on Iran and North 

Korea, it would be a better system, it’d be a safer system.  But we 

can’t do it, and the more we try to do it, by ourselves in that 

role—  

MORLEY SAFER 

One minute—   

IAN BREMMER 

—the less—the, the more incapable we’re going to be, okay, two 

final points since I only have a minute.  First point is, what I like 

in terms of leadership is what Bob Zoellick did, vis-à-vis the 

Chinese, is talk about stakeholdership, and the Chinese 

originally didn’t know how to translate that word but once they 

did they kinda figured it out.   We need more responsibility from 

the actors that are becoming vastly more powerful every day, 

every year vis-à-vis the United States.  We’re increasingly going to 

be unable to be in favor of this motion, in four years, in eight 

years, in 12 years, we’d better prepare for it, by getting more 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 38. 

 

 

 

stakeholdership, leadership, and dare I say global policemanship, 

from the folks around the world that can increasingly take some 

of that lifting regionally.   

 

Final point.  Indispensable nation.  Madeline Albright came up 

with that term, actually originally from James Chase, one of my 

mentors, I fully admit the United States is an indispensable 

nation.  But you know what? If you’re the indispensable part of a 

family, if you’re the husband, if you’re the father, you do not go 

out, and buy a house you can’t afford, with a mortgage you can’t 

service.   What you do, is you actually get your apartment, you 

bring home the bacon, you keep your nose down, and you ensure 

that you are there in a sustainable way.  We need to recognize, 

that we have to eat within our means.   We’ve got a serious 

problem with that in the American economy, I fear we have a 

serious problem with that in terms of global security, and I truly 

hope as a consequence you’ll vote with us against the motion, 

thank you very much.

the British fight in Afghanistan, and ultimately lose?  Seven I 

think.  Or six or three or something like that.  And the Russians 

and everyone else who’s poked their nose in there.  What on 

earth can this cop on the beat, this American cop on the beat, do 

in a place like, either Afghanistan, or in Iraq.  

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

Well, I’ll tell you one—   

MORLEY SAFER  

Other than stay there forever?    

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

Sure, well I can tell you one thing it can do and has done straight 

away which is that Afghanistan is no longer a base where there 

are open training camps where terrorists can train and come and 

attack cities like this one we’re sitting in.   

MORLEY SAFER 

And their heroin—   

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

And that’s—I don’t think, I don’t think that’s a small 

achievement.

And the heroin business is booming.

MORLEY SAFER  

So which—what does—well, the cop’s out there, what’s he doing?   

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

Well, hang on, if you let me finish.  Or—I thought it was one 

question.  Look, as I said it’s no small thing to get the first thing 

done, the thing that was originally why America and her allies 

went into Afghanistan which was to take out flagrant training 

camps of terrorists, and that job has been done.   Now it seems to 

me that the job of sorting out the Afghan economy is a separate 

one, one which the world community generally is involved in, but 

I think that’s a different point.  I don’t know if you wanted to try 

to make me an apologist for the American administration or a 

spokesperson for them but I’m not.    

MORLEY SAFER  

Well, you’re—    

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

My own, my own view for what it’s worth on it is that the job of 

creating a viable, booming economy in Afghanistan is a quite 

different one, now this particular policeman went in and sorted 

out the problem.  It doesn’t also have to be the Social Services 

Department.

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

Thank you—   

MORLEY SAFER 

—you talk about a leader…a fuehrer, out there, someone who’s 

going to, you know, some big pie in the sky who is going to 

suddenly have the world bowing down and saying, we want to 

follow you, leader, whoever that may be.   I mean, this is 

wonderfully kind of anti-Orwellian… stuff you’re saying, but, 

what leader?  What single leader is the world gonna follow?  

America can’t follow a single leader.   

IAN BREMMER 

Well, historically that’s certainly true, America can’t follow a 

single leader but in terms of values and regimes, when we talk 

about for example free trade, the fact is we have an international 

system that the United States has been at the forefront of and 

has been pushing until some trends very recently, has been 

pushing a very strong agenda in free trade where it’s been seen 

as the global leader as a consequence and, whether we’re talking 

about, you know, sort of international norms and regimes or 

whether we’re talking about regional bilateral ones that’s been an 

extremely important process.   The WTO, the World Trade 

Organization, the United States has played a leadership role, the 

US as the world’s largest economy, has helped to smooth and 

create many, many efficiencies.   



Media Transcripts, Inc.

If you want to talk about, um, what happened after the Soviet 

Union, uh, collapsed, if you want to talk about the efforts to 

denuclearize places like Belarus and Kazakhstan and Ukraine, 

the US took a leadership role, that clearly made the world a more 

safe place.  That’s very different from talking about being the 

world’s policeman, I think that there are a lot of countries that do 

criticize when the US doesn’t take a leadership role.  Look at the 

tsunami in Indonesia.  The Chinese put $4 million on the ground, 

about a week afterwards.   The United States got the Japanese, 

the Indians, and the Australians together, billions of dollars, in 

this case, boots on the ground from adding— for providing 

humanitarian assistance, and actually made a serious difference.  

The United States is clearly indispensable in these roles as a 

leader, but I would not say that the US has the capacity to be the 

global policeman.    

MORLEY SAFER

MATTHEW PARRIS 

Well of course I know a great deal less of the American people 

than almost everybody else on the panel, I only have the hunches 

that I get from those whom I know and the time that I spent 

there.  And also a little bit that I know about the history of the 

British empire and British colonialism and much of which I’ve 

lived in my own childhood, and, my impression, and I may be 

wrong, is that the—there’s a good patriotic spirit in America for 

invasions of foreign countries where those invasions can be seen 

as palpably in the national interest in order to defend America 

from people abroad.  But that there isn’t the same interest in 

administering other countries, there isn’t the same interest in 

prolonged occupations of other countries, there isn’t the same 

interest in doing what policemen do abroad, and that it’s only as 

long as America is winning in those circumstances that public 

opinion remains positive, it quite quickly turns against, when 

conditions seem to be coming adverse.    

MORLEY SAFER  

Ellen Laipson, who do you have a question for.    

ELLEN LAIPSON 

I’d like to ask Michael Mandelbaum to tell us how he would get to 

the end state that he desires, of the US as the world’s policeman, 

what would you do, you spoke very disparagingly of the UN.  

What would you do with the 17 current peace missions that the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.-

United States has supported, by its vote authorizing them in the 

Security Council, the 100,000 soldiers and policemen that are 

deployed worldwide in these trouble spots.  Is your view that 

those operations should simply shut down and go away?    

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM 

Not at all, I’m delighted with them, I think we should have more 

of them, I think the United States should support them, but they 

add up to only a small fraction of the policing that’s necessary in 

the world.  In fact, I claim that the United States does police the 

world and does do so effectively and let me give you three 

examples.   In East Asia, contrary to what Mr. Bremmer said, the 

United States does a very effective job of containing although not 

preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons by North Korea, 

with the Seventh Fleet, with its security treaties with Japan and 

South Korea, without them, East Asia would be a much more 

dangerous place.   Similarly, in the Persian Gulf, although the 

United States has not dealt with complete success with Iran, our 

military presence over the horizon and our naval presence 

assures the free flow of petroleum which is a global necessity.   A 

policeman walks the beat.  The United States does that in the 

Persian Gulf and in East Asia, it’s extremely important that it do 

so.  To the extent that other countries can chip in, all the better.  

But they just don’t do enough, and I don’t have any expectation 

that they will.

MORLEY SAFER 

And who—    

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM 

Mr. Parris gave, I would say a rather broad view of American anti-

imperialism but not altogether inaccurate so let me give a reply in 

a similar spirit and it follows onto what Ellen Laipson said and 

my response.  I would say in response to you comment about 

American opposition to the British empire—   

MORLEY SAFER 

Question, in question, sir.    

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM 

It’s a question.  We thought—  [LAUGHTER]  We thought we 

could do it better than you did.  But we were wrong.  Come back.  

We would be delighted for the British to do more by way of global 

policing, so will you, as an influential member of the political 

class in Britain, commit to agitating in favor of the Royal Navy

growing larger rather than smaller so that it can resume the 

policing of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean that it did so well 

and so necessarily and with such great benefit to everyone, 

including that large free-rider across the Atlantic, the United 

States, in the 19th century.   

MATTHEW PARRIS 

Well, I’ll  [APPLAUSE]  I’ll reciprocate your humility.  You suggest 

that you or the Americans have learnt that imperialism, indeed 

British imperialism was a better thing than you thought it was at 

the time.   I would say that we British have learnt that 

imperialism was not as good a thing as we thought that it was, at 

the time, but there is a limit to the extent that a country that has 

no economic global predominance can continue to police large 

sections of the globe.   We learnt that, to our very great cost, it’s a 

lesson that we’ve learnt and I think we’re not going to un-learn it 

and if we have any advice for you it is not to repeat the mistake.   

MORLEY SAFER 

Matthew Parris, do you have a question for someone here.   

MATTHEW PARRIS 

Yes.  I’d—again, it’s to Mr. Mandelbaum.  It’s a serious question, 

I— rather than a—an ad hominem one, I’d like you to…I’d like 

you to deal with the question of legitimacy with policemen, a 

policeman in New York works for an authority that is elected, 

enforces laws which have been enacted by people who have been 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 49. 

 

 

 

elected and is in many ways of the community that he polices.   

America as world policemen would be a very different kind of 

animal.  There would be no such presumed consent, there’s a 

real problem—   

MORLEY SAFER 

Question—   

MATTHEW PARRIS 

—about legitimacy—   

MORLEY SAFER 

—question, please, sir—   

MATTHEW PARRIS 

—about authority, and I wonder how you answer that problem.   

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM 

I answer it as follows.  The United States as the global policeman 

is not as legitimate as the New York City police force is.  And it 

cannot be because there is no global government, no global state 

to give it legitimacy.  But it has enough legitimacy, because 

nobody opposes it, as they would if they didn’t like it and felt 

threatened by it.   Indeed, as I say in my, my book The Case for 

Goliath, [LAUGHTER] I think there is a threat, there is a threat to 

the American role as the world’s governments, but it doesn’t 

come from other countries.  It comes from the mounting costs of 

social welfare, of our entitlement programs, the great threat to 

the American role as the world’s policeman and to global order

AUDIENCE 

[MURMURS FROM AUDIENCE]   

MORLEY SAFER  

Mr. Murray…  [LAUGHTER, VOICES]   

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

Gosh, I don’t have any lack of questions for the other side, but 

the one I’d most like to ask is Ian Bremmer, who mentioned, I 

just pricked up about the Pew polls, about what people across 

the globe think of America.   And aside from the vaguely 

unpleasant sight of anyone caring that much about how much 

they’re liked I wonder if you’ve seen the Pew polls about suicide 

bombing—people who are in favor of suicide bombing as a tactic, 

across the Arab and Muslim world, particularly, legitimizing vast 

percentages the murder of Israelis.   And whether you’ve seen the 

Pew polls that show the number of people across the Middle East 

and elsewhere, the huge numbers of people who think that for 

instance 9-11 was a conspiracy, forced on the American people 

by their own government, by Mossad and all this sort of thing.   

Based on all this, do you think that this is all America’s fault, or 

do you think other people have agency and the ability to cock up.    

IAN BREMMER 

No, I certainly don’t think this is all America’s fault.  I think I’ve 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 51. 

 

 

 

pretty much said I’d like the idea of the United States being the 

world’s policeman, we just can’t get there, it’s generally a kinda 

country I’d probably enjoy, again I’d like the idea of having a 

private plane but it’s not happening tomorrow.   You know, I 

would say that you’re referring to the wrong Pew polls.  In terms 

of my comment, it wasn’t on how much countries like America.  It 

was about how much Americans actually support globalization, 

how much they support free trade.   And also how much they 

believe that the United States benefits from growing foreign 

companies, companies in emerging markets and the rest.  And 

they compared those views on free trade, with the views of other 

foreign nationals in countries like Russia, China and India.   And, 

for—in a dramatic shift of fortunes, Americans have proven to be 

less pro-globalization, less pro-free trade than the Russians, the 

Chinese, and the Indians, and that shows something very 

disturbing, in my view, which is that increasingly the average 

American does not believe that they benefit from the trajectory 

that the world is moving towards.   And that not only speaks 

against growing opposition to the United States serving as the 

world’s policeman, but it also speaks against the United States 

serving the role as, as a leader on key issues where international 

leadership is lacking, and I really fear that we will throw the baby 

out with the bathwater on this one.

MORLEY SAFER  

Ian Bremmer, do you have a question.   

IAN BREMMER 

Yes I do, and I would ask it to Michael but he’s already gotten 

two so I’m gonna ask either Max or Douglas if they—if they want 

to take it.  It is, that—it follows on this issue of legitimacy and the 

notion that all countries around the world kind of like the idea of 

the US as a policeman.  And I’m wondering, what do we do in 

those big issues where it’s clear that they don’t.  You know, what 

do we do about Russia, where clearly, whether we’re talking 

about Chechnya, or Georgia, or Ukraine, the Orange Revolution 

and the rest, the Russians really assertively don’t want the 

United States to be a policeman.   What do we do in a place like 

Taiwan, where the Chinese really assertively—and increasingly 

have the power to stop the US—don’t want the US to act as global 

policeman, how do we—  and I’m asking, actually out of 

legitimate curiosity, how do we deal with those sorts of 

challenges.    

MAX BOOT 

I guess I would reply that’s a little bit like asking well what do we 

do about the fact that John Gotti doesn’t like the NYPD in his 

neighborhood.  Well, you have to deal with those issues, and 

sometimes you have to deal with them diplomatically and 

obviously nobody’s suggesting that we start a war with Russia or 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 53. 

 

 

 

China because we dislike some of their behavior.   But, you—the 

problem with the position that your side takes which is 

multilateralism is that basically, you hold us hostage to the views 

of a Russia or China, you basically say, we cannot act by leading 

a coalition of the willing, we cannot act with our posse, we have 

to wait for some multilateral institution before we can do 

something  and of course, Russia and China have vetoes in the 

most powerful multilateral institution that exists and they use 

their vetoes to shield wrongdoers such as Iran developing nuclear 

weapons, or to try to prevent us from intervening for example in 

Kosovo to stop the genocide.   So if you pay too much heed to the 

opinions of countries like Russia or China or other dictatorships 

which don’t have the best interests, our best interests at heart or 

the world’s best interests at heart, basically you allow the world’s 

worst criminals free rein.  And that’s something I don’t think we 

can afford to, to let happen.

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I—over here.  I have one, over here.  I have a question for Mr. 

Bremmer.  You adduce a nuclear North Korea as an example of a 

failed…police work, is that—is that the case?    

IAN BREMMER 

Inability of the United States to act—not failed police work, just 

the US doesn’t have the capacity to act as a policeman in the 

case of North Korea, yes.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

My understanding is that Madeline Albright went over, Jimmy 

Carter went over, flattered Kim Jong-il…then he went nuclear.  If 

you’re aware of some other…non-diplomatic means that were 

employed and failed, would you please share them with us.   

IAN BREMMER 

Look, I mean, I’m not trying to argue, I think Morley raised the 

same point in a question to Ellen which is that, oh well, 

engagement clearly doesn’t work with Iran because the Iranians 

don’t want to be engaged—I’m with you.  The Iranians don’t want 

to be engaged, they’re moving, they’re going nuclear.   The North 

Koreans didn’t want to be engaged, I mean criminy, they don’t 

want pro-globalization, you throw CNN in North Korea, you know, 

probably Kim Jong-il falls relatively quickly, they want to keep 

the place isolated, they want to build their nukes, they want to 

buy people off, they want to blackmail, they want to sell drugs, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 55. 

 

 

 

they want to sell ballistic missiles, they want to engage in human 

trade.   This is a nasty, brutish and quite short regime.  I don’t 

expect that any of the United States’ policies were likely to work, 

my point was, the Chinese have more leverage over North Korea 

than the United States does, there was no military option, you 

attack North Korea to try to stop them, South Korea’s devastated 

within 36 hours because of artillery if you look at geography.   So 

that wasn’t an option.  Even the most ardent opponents in the 

Defense Department weren’t trying to go there.  So given the fact 

that you don’t like the regime, given you don’t want them to 

develop the nukes, you want to stop them, the United States has 

to think about who has the power, and it’s not just the US, you 

gotta go to the Chinese, who actually are providing these guys 

with the lifeline economically, and say we need to work with you.  

That’s not the US acting as a global policeman, that’s America in 

a more multilateral role trying to cajole relatively incalcitrant [sic] 

countries, recalcitrant countries to do their best.   

MORLEY SAFER  

Other questions?   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

I think one of the key questions has been avoided.  And this only 

was personally alluded by Mr. Parris.  And the, the question is, 

how do you be the policeman if you don’t longer have 

predominance.  The key and imperative word is “predominance.”   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 56. 

 

 

 

Like the English empire, lo— lost its role as master of the world 

when it lost economic predominance after the First World War, 

the United States no longer has the predominance it ought to 

have to be the policeman.  So the question is what can we—be 

done, without the predominance.  

MORLEY SAFER 

You want to take that…    

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM 

Ah.   

MORLEY SAFER 

—Michael Mandelbaum?   

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM 

The United States can continue to act as the world’s policeman 

as long as serious countries do not actively oppose it.  And that 

means that since there is no longer a Cold War, it is in many 

ways cheaper for the United States to carry out the legitimate 

police functions in the world that it does carry out.   And it 

carries them out, with the sufferance, with the tacit agreement of 

major countries, including Russia and China, that disagree with 

the United States on some important issues, but still value the 

American role at least to the extent that they do not oppose it.   

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

Can I also add to that?  There’s a confusion going on at the 

moment here, between policing and being an imperial power.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 57. 

 

 

 

Which is going to I think, cause a problem on the voting at least 

for this side.  Which is why I mention it, being a world policeman 

in the definition that we’re going on at the moment is quite 

different from being a world authoritarian.   And to go back to 

Ellen Laipson’s definitions when she said that, the definition of 

policing would be enforcing the rules, setting the rules and 

having a monopoly on the use of force—   America does enforce 

the rules, they tend not to be ones set by themselves, they tend 

to be set by all sorts of other organizations and nations in history.  

And America certainly doesn’t have monopoly on the use of force 

as for instance the intervention in Sierra Leone by my own 

country would demonstrate.   But I would just tidy that up, just 

because you—we’re saying on this side that, that we would like 

America to be the world’s policeman does not mean we’re 

suggesting that it is like the British Empire was, or that it’s like 

any other empire, I don’t think it is an empire, being a 

policeman’s quite different.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

There are a lot of nasty conflicts in the world at any given time, so 

this is a question for those who support the motion.  What’s the 

criteria… for the, the United States to intervene as policemen, 

would that include Kenya today, would that include, 

Mozambique, would that include Darfur, would that include 

Rwanda in the early ‘90s…    



Media Transcripts, Inc.

MORLEY SAFER  

Excellent question, who wants to field it.    

MAX BOOT 

Well, I don’t think that you can come up with any hard and fast 

criteria, I think a lot of what you do has to be really based on a 

realistic assessment of your capabilities at the moment, and 

nobody suggests that for example, that, if you have…if you saw 

murders occurring in New York City that therefore, the New York 

Police Department is a complete failure.   Obviously there are 

going to be crimes occurring in the world.  We cannot stop all of 

them, it’s beyond our means, everybody will admit that.  But I 

think we have to do what we can.  And I think—I’m with Bill 

Clinton when he said that it was a mistake not to have intervened 

in Rwanda, not to have stopped a genocide that it was in our 

power to stop, I think, it was correct that we did intervene in 

Bosnia and Kosovo and we stopped terrible bloodletting in the 

Balkans.   Today obviously our forces are engaged in Afghanistan 

and Iraq and we don’t have the capability to intervene as many 

including me would like in places like Darfur.  And that’s a sad, 

tragic reality, which means that hundreds of thousands of people 

are dying.   But of course, even if we don’t have the capability to 

lead an intervention with massive use of force we can do other 

things such as using our global leadership role to push economic 

sanctions, or to provide enablers that might allow others to

intervene, but unfortunately for all the talk from the other side, 

about how there are so many others out there willing to play this 

global policing role, we find time and time again, there’s been 

very few cases of anybody willing to step forward where the 

United States does not lead and,  I’m in favor of American 

leadership while recognizing the limits of our power and the fact 

that we cannot possibly intervene in every case, I think we 

should try to do as much good as possible within the bounds of 

our power.   

MATTHEW PARRIS 

There was—if I can just put in quickly, there’s a good quote here 

from Mr. Blair, our former premier in Britain.  When--I mean I 

think on the important point to make which is that just because 

you can’t intervene everywhere doesn’t mean you don’t intervene 

anywhere.   And before the Iraq war Mr. Blair was asked by a 

journalistnwhy he was going for this particular conflict and he 

said, it’s a very important phrase and I absolutely agree with it, 

he said people—I get fed up when people say to me why not the 

Burmese lot, why not Mugabe.  He said, I don’t, because I can’t.  

But when you can, you should.    

MORLEY SAFER  

We have time for two more questions, brief ones, please.    

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Question is for the proponents of the motion.  Given the fact that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 60. 

 

 

 

Medicare and Social Security, and other elements in our safety 

net are gonna be with us for a while would any of you advocate 

the institution of a military draft, to provide the power that would 

be necessary to be the world policeman on a scale that would fit 

the needs of the problems that are going to arise in the 

foreseeable future.    

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM 

I don’t think a draft would solve the problem.  And of course the 

military doesn’t want a draft, and the United States carries out its 

policing role without a huge mass army of the kind that great 

powers fielded until the last third of the 20th Century.  But I do 

agree, and I did say, that this is a substantial problem and does 

present a threat to American foreign policy.  And if it results in 

the curtailing of the global services that include providing a 

global police force, the whole world, including those who most 

harshly criticize American foreign policy, will be sorry.    

MAX BOOT 

Can I just jump in and just make one point?  Because I think in 

your question and some of the others I kind of scent this notion 

of American declinism in the air.  And the fact that we’re…Woe is 

us.  We’re over-stretched.  We can’t do everything that we want to 

do.  And I think you should be aware of just how vast our power 

is.  The fact is that we spend more than the rest of the world, or 

as much as the rest of the world combined, on defense.  And 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 61. 

 

 

 

we’re still spending only four per cent of our GDP, which is 

several percentage points less than we were spending during the 

Cold War.  We still have the world’s largest and richest economy.  

We’ve been creating jobs at a pace that out-clips any other 

industrialized economy over the last twenty or thirty years.  Our 

population size is growing.  We’re already the third largest 

country by population in the world.  And we’re projected to 

increase by another hundred and fifty million over the course of 

the next fifty years.  There are vast pools of power and resources 

in the United States that can be mobilized for the task that we 

have to undertake.  And in fact, we have mobilized them in 

essentially policing the world over the last sixty years.  It is a very 

doable mission.    

MORLEY SAFER  

One more question.  And please, a brief one and direct it to one of 

the panelists.   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I have a question over here.  Actually, unfortunately, it’s a very 

general question, which is I’m getting more and more confused as 

this discussion goes on what the difference is between policing 

the world and actually using the military to go to war.  And the 

two seem to be discussed along with each other.  And I think 

they’re very different issues.  So I don’t know if anyone wants to 

take it.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 62. 

 

 

 

MORLEY SAFER  

[OVERLAP]  Who, who is that question directed to?  Which side?   

FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I’ll take it for the motion.   

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM 

[OVERLAP]  [UNCLEAR]  You’ve answered it.  You’ve already 

answered the question.  Why don’t you answer it again?   

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

[OVERLAP]  Yeah, I mean, just to get back to this point is that, I 

think that I can speak for people on this side and just say that 

again, that the policing issue, it doesn’t – First of all, it does not 

have to be prime…only military.  And I think that’s my, that’s 

fairly obvious.  And even a member of the other side conceded, 

America’s role in operations like the post-tsunami operations a 

couple of years ago.  And I think that, as I say, this should be 

cleared up before you vote – that the issue – and I think I 

mentioned it in my comments earlier, that the issue of, for 

instance, sustaining an operation, remaining in a country and all 

these sort of things, is not what we are talking about as policing.  

That policing operations are not welfare operations, as I 

mentioned earlier, but are also not imperialist operations.  

They’re not even operations which, people might think of 

sustaining for the long term.   

MAN  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.-

If I could just, could I just --   

MORLEY SAFER  

[OVERLAP]  No, we will in a moment.  We are going to wind this 

up.  Each of the debaters has two minutes and I will give you a 

one minute warning.  And we will start with the team against the 

motion, Ellen Laipson, please.    

ELLEN LAIPSON  

Thanks, Morley.  I admire the optimism of the other side, that 

America’s power remains preeminent and will continue to be in – 

and they have been somewhat selective in their metrics or their 

use of factual information.  I do think that we have some serious 

questions about the capacity to spread our military and civilian 

forces thinner around the world.  One only needs to listen to 

military commanders’ concerns about recruitment, retention, the 

cost of medical care to our soldiers, et cetera, to realize that, you 

know, there are limits to our ability to serve this function.  And I 

think there is both an ethical and a political argument of why not 

share it with others?  I’ve heard the other side say, Oh, we’re, we 

like allies.  Allies are fine.  But they still believe that the essential 

decision making authority of deciding when to act –  

MORLEY SAFER 

[OVERLAP]  One minute.   

ELLEN LAIPSON 

…and where to act, is, resides in the United States.  And I just 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 64. 

 

 

 

don’t think that’s the way the world works anymore.  I really do 

believe that while the United States remains a country of 

exceptional wealth, talent, et cetera – and I deeply hope we 

remain so indefinitely --  we should be aware of a redistribution 

of talent, capacity in the international system.  And we should 

embrace this and turn it into a virtue.  We should not be afraid of 

it.  We should not be threatened by it.  And we should not think 

that that United States alone has a monopoly on wisdom about 

how to respond to the world’s trouble spots.  And for me one of 

the strongest arguments of this discussion tonight has been 

legitimacy.  Michael conceded that we would have less legitimacy 

than the New York police, but that other countries so far haven’t 

pushed back.  I think that’s not a permanent state of affairs and I 

think that we should be looking for, in – if we believe truly in 

democratic values, and I know we do – legitimacy should matter a 

lot.  We should care more what other countries think and what 

their preferences are for finding the best solution to the world’s 

policemen.  Thank you.    

MORLEY SAFER  

Max Boot, you’re next.   

MAX BOOT 

Well, I’d like to begin by addressing the question that was just 

asked because I think it’s an important point.  And by no means 

do those of us on this side advocate waging perpetual war.  In 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 65. 

 

 

 

fact, what I believe is that if America takes seriously its global 

policing responsibilities that makes war less likely, not more 

likely.  When you think simply about what an urban police force 

does, for example – cops on the beat walk the beat.  They don’t 

fire their guns very often.  And the more they’re out there, the 

more they have a presence the more they deter crime and the 

less, uh, likely it is that criminals will prey on innocent people.   

 

And they can have their greatest effect simply with the same kind 

of, uh, street corner presence that we expect here in New York 

City.  And that’s essentially what the United States has been 

doing around the world for more than sixty years, where our navy 

keeps the Straits of Hormuz open.  They patrol the world’s ocean 

to prevent pirates or other predators from disrupting the flow of 

global commerce.   

MORLEY SAFER 

One minute.   

MAX BOOT 

[OVERLAP]  Our troops are stationed in countries like Japan and 

South Korea and Germany and elsewhere to prevent conflict, to 

deter conflict from occurring.  And all you have to do to realize 

why this is a good thing is just to imagine the consequences of a 

world without American leadership.  I mean, imagine arms races 

spiraling out of control in East Asia and Europe.  Imagine Iran 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 66. 

 

 

 

closing the Straits of Hormuz.  Imagine chaos and civil war 

spilling over the borders of Iraq and Afghanistan into neighboring 

states.   Imagine terrorists getting their hands on nuclear 

weapons.  Now, you may think I’m being melodramatic but, in 

fact, I think history shows the dire consequences of America 

abdicating its global policing role.  And if even ten percent or a 

third of the things that I’m talking about are likely to happen if 

we give up this policing function, it’s an unacceptable risk.  And 

we can afford the, the, uh, global policing function which we have 

performed.  It is not bankrupting our country.  It is a very small 

share of our public purse.  [UNCLEAR]   

MORLEY SAFER 

[OVERLAP]  You must wrap it up.   

MAX BOOT 

We have to continue in order to prevent the very wars that all of 

us decry.   

MORLEY SAFER 

Matthew Parris.    

MATTHEW PARRIS  

Well, I’m becoming more and more confused listening to Max 

Boot as to whether the United States can or can’t afford this role.  

In one breath he says they can and then challenged over Africa, 

he says they can’t.  That quote from Tony Blair that Douglas 

Murray gave us was thoroughly disingenuous.  I don’t because I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 67. 

 

 

 

can’t.  Britain is perfectly capable of toppling Mugabe’s regime in 

Zimbabwe.  The United States is perfectly capable of instigating 

free and fair elections in Kenya.  Britain and the United States 

together could do something about Darfur.  They don’t and the 

reason that they don’t, I believe, is that there is no coherent view 

on the part of the allies as to what the role of world’s policeman 

would be or where the world’s policeman would police.  And I 

believe that one of the reasons there’s no coherent view is 

American democracy.  I don’t think the American people are 

really into this kind of thing.  I don’t think the American people 

really want this role.  If they did there would have been much 

more discussion as to how it should be imposed.  Secondly, 

multilateralism.   

MORLEY SAFER 

One minute.    

MATTHEW PARRIS  

[OVERLAP]  Are they in favor of it or are they against it on the 

other side?  Max Boot seemed to speak very disparagingly about 

multilateralism.  Mr. Mandelbaum spoke about the feebleness of 

the United Nations.  One of the reasons for the feebleness of the 

United Nations is that countries like America, and to some extent 

Britain, have not entirely supported the United Nations.  There’s 

lots of things wrong with the United Nations.  But one of them is 

there is no feeling that the United States any longer really wants 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 68. 

 

 

 

to make the United Nations a driving multilateral force.  Douglas, 

Murray spoke about police not policing, not really meaning the 

assertion of force.  He seemed to call up a vision of an American 

world policeman as a kind of world marriage guidance counselor 

or world social worker or world priest or, uh--  

MORLEY SAFER 

[OVERLAP]  I must ask, I must ask you to wrap it up.   

MATTHEW PARRIS 

…or Rabbi.  I will wrap up.  America has two great weapons.  One 

is force and the other is persuasion, the power of moral 

persuasion.  They are not complementary.  The more force is 

used the more the power of moral persuasion will be 

undermined.  And I would urge you to oppose the motion and to 

support the idea of moral persuasion and not the use of force.    

MORLEY SAFER  

Michael Mandelbaum.    

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM  

Some people in New York – possibly including some people in this 

room – are unhappy.  [AUDIENCE REACTION]  The New York 

Police Department can’t help you.  Morley Safer noted that 

despite the presence of NATO forces – and incidentally, if you 

want to see just what America’s allies are willing to do in a cause 

with which they agree, check out their performance in 

Afghanistan.  It’s pretty pathetic.  Despite, Morley Safer has 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 69. 

 

 

 

noted that drugs are still traded.  They’re still traded in New York, 

within a few blocks of here.  That’s not an argument against New 

York having a police force.  And what is true of New York is true 

of the world as well.  The fact that the United States cannot bring 

Chechnya to a successful resolution is not an argument against 

the United States acting as the world’s police force.   

 

The job of a police force in the world, as in New York, is not to 

make things perfect.  It’s to keep things from becoming worse.  

And that the United States does in the world in two important 

ways – by its military deployments and alliances that undergird 

globalization and by leading the effort against nuclear 

proliferation and deterring rogue states if and when they get 

nuclear weapons.  Those are important global tasks.  They are 

the tasks of global policing.  Other countries and other 

organizations have shown no inclination to do them.  Therefore it 

is in everybody’s interest that the United States continue to do 

so.  That is why you should support this motion.   

MORLEY SAFER 

Ian Bremmer.  [APPLAUSE]   

IAN BREMMER 

You’ve brought up a number of times the notion that nobody else 

wants to be the global policeman so the United States has to step 

up for the job.  I agree.  Nobody else wants to be the world’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 70. 

 

 

 

policeman.  Lots of people want to be their own region’s and their 

own neighborhood’s policeman.  Some of them, thankfully, are 

incapable, like Venezuela.  Some of them are increasingly 

capable, like China in Asia and like Russia in Eurasia.  And the 

United States has to recognize that.  They have to recognize that 

the extraordinary shift in importance of alliances and the 

importance in the battles of the hearts and minds, not of the 

individual people in these countries, but of the leaders that have 

to support this policing role to provide legitimacy is not only 

assured by the world’s largest military but also by the world’s 

largest trade flows.  But –  

MORLEY SAFER 

[OVERLAP]  One…  

IAN BREMMER  

[OVERLAP]  …but also by the influence in these countries.  And 

we’re seeing that in terms of China’s extraordinary influence in 

Latin America, which is growing by the second, in Africa, by 

Russia and Eurasia and the rest.  The United States is going to 

have to learn to live with this.  Look, it’s true that a lot of 

Americans aren’t happy.  They’re unhappy because of subprime.  

They’re unhappy because of recession.  They’re unhappy because 

of energy and security.  They’re unhappy because of Iraq.  And 

increasingly they’re unhappy because the bailout that’s coming 

isn’t like the U.S. government with the S&L crisis.  The bailout 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 71. 

 

 

 

that’s happening with the big blue chips right now is coming from 

China and the Gulf and the rest.  We don’t want to throw the 

baby out with the bath water.  We don’t want Americans that are 

increasingly insecure to say the U.S. shouldn’t play a leadership 

role.  Look, every debate needs a theme.  For me this theme is 

that the great should never be the enemy of the good.  Okay, now 

I’m an American and I’d love to have the great.  But I tell you, I’d 

take what I can get.  [APPLAUSE]   

MORLEY SAFER 

Douglas Murray.   

DOUGLAS MURRAY 

Thank you.  I’d like to start off by mentioning something Ellen 

Laipson said that she said some time earlier, that the rest of the 

world is providing the actual police.  And one of the reasons why 

that may be the case is because you as a nation are the ones that 

are doing the heavy lifting.  It’s not hard for Canada or somebody 

to not be able to provide troops, but to be able to provide 

policemen.  It’s not hard for Germany to send legions of people to 

Afghanistan who won’t fire a gun.  You can find those people.    

 

Who are you going to call?  This is the question that we should 

have in our minds.  When something goes wrong, when a 

tsunami occurs, when a massive humanitarian catastrophe like 

that, when a rogue state emerges, when a failed state becomes an 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 72. 

 

 

 

even more failed state or a successful one starts to fail who are 

you going to call?  Is it going to be another nation state?  Or is it 

going to be the U.N.?  Matthew Parris mentioned the U.N.  The 

idea of the U.N. policing the world is like saying that you just pick 

a cross section of every household in New York and say that that 

house will do the policing and that one and that one.  In other 

words, an entirely random process which will mean you’ll get a 

certain amount of people who are fine but you won’t get the 

driven people.  You won’t get the people who are prepared to do 

the job, who are trained to do the job, who are financed to do the 

job.   

 

You’ll get some people who can do it accidentally.  You’ll also get 

some bums and some lazy guys and some guys who are just 

wicked and others.  And that’s what the U.N. is composed of, is a 

whole group of people who you would give more legitimacy for the 

simple fact that they’re there?  And you know, this comes back to 

this issue I raised earlier about America wanting to be liked.  You 

can police the world, you can be the world’s policeman.  You 

should not be, it looks extremely bad to look like you’re 

desperately wanting to be loved by the rest of the world as well.  

You will be blamed when you’re the world’s most powerful nation.  

You will be blamed when you intervene and you will be blamed 

when you don’t.  You will just have to put up with that.  And 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation-Intelligence Square U.S.- 

 America Should be the World's Policeman Page 73. 

 

 

 

when the other side says that the great should not be the enemy 

of the good, I don’t think anyone on this side would be or has 

implied that it would be.  But the great should certainly be the 

enemy of the bad.   

MORLEY SAFER
