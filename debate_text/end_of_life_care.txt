John Donvan: 
Good evening, everyone.  Hi.  Hello.  My name is John Donvan, and I will be moderating 
the debate which begins in about four minutes.  I wanted to have a quick chat with you 
about a few things relating to primarily your role as members of the audience. 
 Normally, we do these debates in New York, and occasionally we go on the road, and 
it's really a pleasure for us to be here in Chicago.  So I'm going to give you the spiel I give 
you in New York, which is this:  We want you as members of the audience not to 
consider yourself passive listeners.  We need you to be the opposite of that.  You

actually act as the judges in the debate.  You choose the winner of the debate.  And the 
way we have you do that, if you see at your seats, there's a keypad.  And at the very 
beginning of the debate, I'm going to state the motion, "Ration End-Of-Life Care," and, 
before the debate, you agree with this motion, we want you to register that by pushing 
number one.  If you disagree, we want you to push number two.   
 
19:31:00 
 
And if you're undecided, push number three.  And you can ignore all of the other keys at 
that point.  They are not live.  And if you push a key incorrectly, just correct yourself, 
and the system will lock in your last vote.  At the end of the debate, after you've heard 
the arguments, and we're asking you to keep an open mind through the course of the 
evening.  After you've really listened to the arguments and listened closely, we're going 
to ask you to vote again.  And we want to see whose minds have been changed or who 
came out of undecided to take one of the positions.  And the team at the end of the 
evening whose percentage has changed the most according to your vote is going to be 
declared our winner.   
 
The second way in which your role is critical as members of the audience is that after a 
round, a formal round of opening statements by each debater in turn, we will then have 
a session where it's more mixed up.  They can address each other and take questions 
from me.  At that point, I also want to take questions from you.  And the way that will 
work is if you just raise your hand, and I find you, just stand up.   
 
19:32:00 
 
A microphone will be brought to you, and we want you to hold the microphone about 
this far away from your mouth.  I'll explain why in a second.  Basically so that we can 
hear you.  We'd like you to state your name and then ask a question.  Now, on the 
question, this does get tricky in New York at least.  We don't want you to debate with 
the debaters.  We -- that's what they're here to do.  We want you really to ask a 
question that will move forward the discussion of this motion.  What they're really here 
to debate and persuade you on is this short statement:  "Ration end-of-life care."  So I'd 
like you to think in terms of asking a question that focuses on that, not a secondary 
issue.  And I'll be fine if you want to make a short, very, very short opening statement of 
your premise.  But then I want you to get to a question.  And you'll know that it's a 
question because if a question mark goes at the end of the statement naturally, then it's 
going to work.  And I will -- I will respectfully decline questions that are really off topic.   
 
19:33:03 
 
And I may have to step in and help you phrase your question if you're struggling, but I 
do follow that very respectfully.  We are being broadcast ultimately on NPR stations, on 
NPR -- on podcast downloads, on television in New York, not live, but we are live

streaming right now as we speak.  But because of that, a few things you need to know. 
 There are certain formalities that we need to observe for the broadcast.  I'm going to 
have to tell you many, many times that we're in Chicago and many times that I'm John 
Donvan.  All things like that come back from the break.  So just so you know that I 
haven't lost my bearings, that there's a purpose for that.   
 
Also, a number of times through the evening, given that this is the home of the great 
program, "Wait, wait, don't tell me," whose sound is -- whose live studio sound is just 
spectacular, we want to hear from you in the evening; feel pleased, to laugh, to laugh, 
to applaud, to express your dissatisfaction as long as it's not in an ugly way.   
 
19:34:05 
 
You know, a well-placed guffaw is fine.  We would -- we don't want you shouting out or 
anything.  And -- but again, really give thought to things.  And at certain times during the 
broadcast, during those times, probably just before I introduce myself yet again, I'm 
going to raise my hand, and that's an obvious signal for, "Can you please give a round of 
applause?"  So I know that we don't even have to practice that.  But in the beginning, 
I'm going to be introducing each of the debaters.  It will be great if you could applaud 
each of them.  My hand will be going up for that.   
 
The last thing, because we're doing a radio broadcast, is we have a lot of microphones 
placed all over the room.  And cell phones and Blackberries, et cetera, will cause 
interference with them if it reaches a certain critical mass.  So we're -- we're fine if 
you're Tweeting about this.  In fact, we're delighted by that.  If you're live Tweeting, 
fine, because we don't think there will be enough people doing that to cause problems.   
 
19:35:01 
 
But if you're not using your phone for that purpose, please shut down entirely.  And you 
don't want it ringing in the middle of the debate and then having that be heard on NPR 
stations across the station as you stifle your phone.  So that's it.  We're really, really 
delighted to be here and delighted that we have a full house upstairs and down.  And 
folks upstairs, I need to tell you that our microphones for questions won't go up there. 
 But if you make a special trip to come downstairs, and I notice, I'll try very hard to call 
on you to come into the debate.  So we are put together -- we exist because of an 
organization called the Rosenkranz Foundation which started Intelligence Squared U.S. 
with the mission of raising the level of public discourse.  And to help us now frame what 
this debate is, I would like to invite to the stage, to the seats out front, the chairman of 
the board of Intelligence Squared U.S., Robert Rosenkranz.

John Donvan 
So Bob is just going to talk to us very briefly about what's going to happen here, why 
we're doing this.  So what's at stake basically, Bob, in this debate? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, this is one of the most intense emotional kinds of issues that we've ever debated. 
 It raises all kinds of questions about ethics, but it also raises huge public policy 
questions.  In our country, we're spending about 17 percent of GNP on healthcare. 
 Other rich countries spend about 9 percent.  And a big driver of that is what's spent in 
the last year of life.  And so like 30 percent of all Medicare expenditures are in the final 
year of life.  And this is frankly driving the huge government deficits that all of us are 
worried about, and it also, when it gets down to the level of the individual family, it's 
kind of why families in America have seen no increase in their real incomes over the last 
decade.   
 
19:37:05 
 
All of the improvement in productivity and growth over that time has gone to 
healthcare. 
 
John Donvan 
So the side that's arguing for rationing has what going for it as its strongest argument? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz:   
Well, I think the strongest argument simply is that we cannot afford to provide 
unlimited healthcare, particularly at the end of life, as if it were a free good.  There has 
to be a way to bring in under control.  And either governments or insurance companies 
have to ration end-of-life care as a policy response. 
 
John Donvan 
And the opposite way, the side arguing against rationing. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz:   
The side arguing against would say that healthcare, particularly at the end of life, should 
be the subject of a discussion between your doctor and your patient and the patient's 
family.  And the argument against is really summed up in very colorful language.  No one 
wants death panels. 
 
19:38:06 
 
John Donvan 
And why this debate now?

Robert Rosenkranz:   
Well, I think the answer is the presidential debate.  This is one of the critical national 
issues.  And I expect, because it's such an emotionally difficult issue, it is not going to be 
debated forthrightly in the presidential debates.  So I thought this was a good 
opportunity to do it. 
 
John Donvan 
So we'll do it here.  Thank you, Bob.  And so that is the shape of this debate.  And let's 
bring our debaters to the stage. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan 
And I would just like to ask for one more round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz for 
making all of this possible. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:39:04 
 
John Donvan 
Yes or no to this statement:  End-of-life care, we can't afford to keep every elderly 
person alive, so we're going to have to ration it.  Is that right, or is that wrong?  Well, 
since probably all of us at some point want to have our crack at it, when it's our turn, 
but probably all of us in the meantime, we're going to have to pay for it for everybody 
else, and since there really are two serious sides to this argument, then let's make a 
debate of it.  I'm John Donvan, a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.  We are in 
Chicago, Chicago Ideas Week.  It is a pleasure to be here. 
 
The motion that's on the table, "Ration End-of-Life Care."  We have four superbly 
qualified debaters, two against two, who will be arguing for and against this motion. 
 Our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and 
only one side wins.  On the side arguing for the motion, "Ration End-of-Life Care," 
Arthur Kellermann, the Paul O'Neill Alcoa chair in Policy Analysis at the Rand 
Corporation. 
 
19:40:06 
 
[applause] 
 
His partner, Peter Singer, professor bioethics in the University Center for Human Values 
at Princeton University.

The motion, "Ration End-of-Life Care," and here to argue against the motion, Ken 
Connor, chairman and founder of the Center for a Just Society. 
 
[applause] 
 
And his partner, Sally Pipes, president and chief executive officer of the Pacific Research 
Institute. 
 
[applause] 
 
Let's start off with "Ration End-of-Life Care," and let's meet our debaters.  First, Dr. 
Arthur Kellermann. 
 
[applause] 
 
Doctor, you worked in and you taught emergency medicine for about a quarter of a 
century.   
 
19:40:59 
 
That's the front line in this really, and I want to ask you, do you think the rest of us, we, 
civilians, in this world, really have any idea how often these end-of-life decisions come 
up in the ER? 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
John, we save a lot more lives than we lose, but we deal with the issues we're going to 
debate tonight far more often than anyone realizes. 
 
John Donvan 
Okay, and your partner, Peter Singer. 
 
[applause] 
 
Peter is a professor of bioethics at Princeton, and you wrote in the New York Times a 
few years back that a system of rationing care should include measures of the quality of 
life but not judgments about moral character or social value.  Why not? 
 
Peter Singer:   
Well, I think that's not the business of physicians.  I think they can judge.  There are 
ways of judging quality of life and life expectancy, but moral character is something 
different.  It's too subjective, I think.  I wouldn't like to see it used as a criteria in there.

John Donvan 
All right, Peter Singer.  Our motion is this, "Ration end-of-life care," and here to argue 
against the motion, first, Ken Connor. 
 
[applause] 
 
Ken, you are chairman of the Center for a Just Society, and you played a major role in 
perhaps the most well known case that centered on end-of-life issues, the Terri Schiavo 
case, in which the nation and the family was divided over the question of whether to 
remove the feeding tube from a young woman.  The governor of Florida was 
empowered by the law called "Terri's Law" to become involved in that.  What was your 
involvement in that story? 
 
Ken Connor: 
I represented the governor in defending Terri's Law. 
 
John Donvan  
And the fact that in the end your side lost? 
 
Ken Connor: 
Terri's Law, was struck down by the Florida Supreme Court, and Terry was ordered to 
die by starvation and dehydration.  She did so over a 13-day period.  If the court had 
ordered that of Ted Bundy, it would have been deemed to be cruel and unusual 
punishment, but that's precisely what it was.   
 
 
John Donvan: 
And your partner, Sally Pipes, ladies and gentlemen. 
 
[applause] 
 
19:43:00 
 
You are also arguing against rationing end-of-life care, and you wrote a book called "The 
Top 10 Myths of American Health Care."  So what do you think is the number one myth 
about end-of-life care? 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Well, I think that one should not have to die earlier than one might in order to benefit 
society and reduce costs.  People should have the right to die and to live as long as they 
can.

John Donvan 
All right.  So we have already heard a taste of where this debate is going to go by 
listening, hearing all of our debaters in these brief introductions.  Now, in this debate, 
you, our live audience here in Chicago, act as our judges.  By the time the debate has 
ended, you will have been asked to vote two times, once before the debate and once 
again after the debate, on where you stand on this motion.  And the team who has 
moved the most of you to their side by the end of the evening, and it's as a percentage 
term, will be declared our winner.  So let's have our preliminary vote.  If you go to the 
keypads on your seat, you'll see a series of numbers, but you only need to pay attention 
to one, two, and three.   
 
19:44:06 
 
We're going to ask you to push number one if you agree with the motion, "Ration end-
of-life care," That's the side that this side is arguing for.  If you agree at this point with 
this side, if you are against the motion, if you disagree with the motion, "Ration end-of-
life care," push number two.  And if you are undecided at this point, push number three. 
 My guess is that the undecideds are who these debaters are really fighting for, but not 
necessarily.  We have had a lot of debates where people said that they listened so 
closely that their minds are actually changed because the arguments were so good. 
 
So we're going to lock that out now.  And again, at the end of the debate, we'll have you 
vote a second time, and the team whose numbers have changed most as a percentage 
will be declared our winner. 
 
So our motion is, "Ration End-Of-Life care."  And on to round one, opening statements 
by each debater in turn.  They will be seven minutes each.   
 
19:45:02 
 
And speaking first, for the motion, Arthur Kellermann, the Paul O'Neill co-chair and 
policy analyst at the RAND Corporation.  Prior to this, he was a professor of emergency 
medicine.  Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Kellermann. 
 
[applause] 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
As you hear from each of us tonight, I urge you to not only listen to our arguments, but 
consider our different backgrounds and our different interests.  Since 2010, I've worked 
for the RAND Corporation.  RAND is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research 
organization that's dedicated to objective analysis of some of the toughest policy 
questions confronting our country and the world.  RAND analysts are expected to be 
dispassionate and detached.  That's not a good way to win an "Intelligence Squared" 
debate. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
[laughter] 
 
So this morning I advised RAND I was taking a day of annual leave.  And I'm here tonight 
not as a RAND analyst but as an ER doctor. 
 
19:46:03 
 
Who, as John said, worked for 25 years taking care of severely ill, injured, and dying 
patients in some of our nation's busiest ERs.  The goal of emergency medicine is always 
to save lives.  But you would be surprised how often we have to make decisions in 
consultation with patients and their families about whether or not initiating heroic 
measures is, in fact, the right thing to do and what the patient really wants.  It happens 
when a critically ill patient is rushed to the ER in the very last stages of a terminal illness. 
 And that usually happens when the patient's personal physician, well, they never got 
around to having the conversation.  They never got around to talking with the patient 
about, "What will they want us to do when they reach that point?"  So we end up having 
that conversation with the patient or with their loved ones at 2:00 in the morning in a 
family conference room or at the bedside. 
 
19:47:07 
 
Now, from a medical or a business perspective, the easiest thing to do, by far, is just full-
court press.  Start resuscitation, incubate the patient, roll out the breathing machine, 
put in IV lines.  But, you know, it doesn't always accomplish what we want.  And rather 
than prolonging life, it simply prolongs the process of dying.  That's why when 
"Intelligence Squared" called me and asked if I would do this debate tonight, my answer 
was an immediate yes, not only because of what the patient goes through, but what 
their family goes through too. 
 
Now, to clarify what we're debating tonight, I think it's important for us to define just 
what we mean.  What kind of end-of-life care are we talking about?  Medical and 
surgical treatments that do not achieve a reasonable goal of medicine should not be 
used.  
 
19:48:03 
 
Limiting this type of care is not rationing; it's good medicine.  Many treatments are used 
to achieve goals that patients did not want or were not proportionate to the burdens 
that the treatment imposed, because there was either ineffective communication about 
the disease prognosis, there is a failure to achieve adequate informed patient consent, 
or there was no advanced care planning.  Avoiding these treatments is not rationing; it's 
simply rectifying poor-quality care. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And some treatments are deserved, but they're extremely costly and have a very low 
chance of success.  Declining to pay for such treatments is what most people would 
consider rationing.  And my teammate, Professor Singer, will have more to say about 
that in a minute.  But I do think there is one type of end-of-life care that is not used 
often enough.   
 
19:49:01 
 
It's relatively inexpensive.  It's highly valued by patients.  And it's effective.  It's palliative 
care.  Palliative care is specialized care that's focused on relieving pain, relieving the 
burden of symptoms, helping the patient to be as comfortable and as functional as they 
can be as they approach the last days of their lives.  Now, two years ago, a group of 
cancer specialists published an amazing study in the "New England Journal of Medicine." 
 They took a group of patients with a very serious type of lung cancer.  And they 
randomly assigned them to two treatment groups.  One treatment group got palliative 
care and standard cancer treatment.  The other group got very aggressive, advanced 
cancer care.  And they followed the two groups.  The palliative care group not only had a 
better quality of life and less depression prior to their death.   
 
19:49:58 
 
They lived longer than the group that got aggressive treatment.  This past August 
another team followed nearly 400 cancer patients during their last months in life.  Those 
that avoided hospitalization and avoided the intensive care unit were less worried. 
 Those who prayed or meditated, those who were visited by their pastor in the hospital 
or in clinic, those who felt they had a strong bond with their doctors were happier, had 
higher quality of life and did better in the last days that they had on this earth.  So at the 
outset of this debate, let's assume that our opponents did not come here to defend bad 
medicine.  And you can be confident that Professor Singer and I did not come here to 
advocate limiting access to palliative care.  So that leaves us with a pretty narrow set of 
situations in a highly charged question:  Do patients in the last stages of terminal illness 
have an unqualified right to extremely costly treatments of uncertain value for as long 
as they want?   
 
19:51:02 
 
Because if the answer is yes, the rest of us have to be prepared to pay the price. 
 Despite remarkable progress of medical science, the global death rate is still 100 
percent. 
 
[laughter] 
 
So the question is not whether we're going to live or die.  The question is where and 
how we'll die and who will be with us when we do.  Most of us don't want to die in an 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

intensive care unit strapped to a bed under fluorescent lights separated from our loved 
ones.  Yet that's precisely what happens to too many of us because all too often our 
healthcare system is too focused on making money, too preoccupied with its technical 
prowess and too busy to sit down with a patient and have an honest, thoughtful, candid 
conversation about prognosis and the patient's wishes at the end of life.  As a physician, 
my goals are simple:  To save as many lives as I can, to ease pain and suffering when I 
cannot, and always, always treat my patients with compassion and respect.   
 
19:52:08 
 
That's why at the end of this evening I urge you to vote for the proposition.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan 
Now, arguing against the motion, Sally Pipes.  She is president and chief executive 
officer of the Pacific Research Institute.  She also writes a weekly health column for 
forbes.com and is the author of "The Pipes Plan:  The Top Ten Ways to Dismantle and 
Replace Obama Care."  Ladies and gentlemen, Sally Pipes. 
 
[applause] 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Thank you, John.  And I am against the proposition that we should ration end-of-life 
care.  My mother was Canadian and a senior.  In July of '05, she felt she had colon 
cancer.  Her primary care doctor said she did not because he did an X-ray and no cancer 
showed up.   
 
19:53:02 
 
Well, we all know that colon cancer is not detected by an X-ray but by a colonoscopy. 
 But she could not get one in Canada because of her age and the fact that a waiting list 
for people under 65 with colon cancer symptoms was over six months.  So by late 
November, my mother was hemorrhaging and had lost 35 pounds.  She knew she was ill, 
and she went to the hospital in an ambulance and went to the emergency room, spent 
two days in the transit lounge.  Then she did get her colonoscopy.  But sadly, she passed 
away two weeks later from metastasized colon cancer.  This is the outcome when 
government bureaucrats set the rules for who is going to get care and when.  This is 
rationed care and what will face seniors in America if the Affordable Care Act is not 
repealed and replaced.   
 
19:53:58

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Rationing care at the end of life may be a sound solution in the abstract.  But when it 
comes to your mother, your father or your child who has a terminal illness, it is wrong 
for social engineers and government bureaucrats to make these life decisions for you. 
 
In Canada where I grew up, the government spends 11.4 percent of gross domestic 
product on healthcare.  And private health insurance is outlawed.  The government sets 
a global budget, the one that government can afford.  The demand for healthcare is 
much greater than the supply.  As a result, Canadians spend -- and they have long 
waiting lists, rationed care and lack of access to the latest treatments.  17 percent of 
Canadians are waiting to get a primary care doctor.  In 2011, 940,000 Canadians were 
on a waiting list waiting for treatment.  The average wait in 2011 from seeing a primary 
care doctor to getting treatment by a specialist was 19 weeks, up from 18.2 weeks the 
year before.   
 
19:55:04 
 
In the case of my own mother, it may have shortened her life, but it was definitely 
cheaper for the government.  In the case of my mother, it may have shortened her life. 
 But colon cancer is one of the most common diseases among our seniors.  A study 
published in the British journal Lancet Oncology, suggests that America is one of the 
best countries for treating cancer and survival rates five years after diagnosis for 13 of 
the 16 most common cancers.  Do we want to change this outcome by controlling 
healthcare costs through rationed care?  For example breast cancer survival rates 
among American women is 83.5 percent, whereas in Britain, it's only 70 percent. 
 Prostate cancer, survival rate 92 percent in the U.S., only 51 percent in Britain.   
 
19:56:03 
 
So how will the Affordable Care Act ration care for our seniors and in particular those in 
need of healthcare?  In three ways:  The Independent Payment Advisory Board, 
accountable care organizations and the patient-centered Outcome Research Institute. 
 First, IPAB; on October 1, President Obama and Governor Romney spent a lot of time 
debating the issue of IPAB.  IPAB will be a panel of 15 unelected members appointed by 
the president and approved by the Senate whose job it is to cut Medicare spending.  It 
will go into effect when federal spending by doctors and hospitals on Medicare exceeds 
the average Consumer Price Index growth rate between 2014 and 2018.  After that, 
costs will be tied to GDP growth plus 1 percent.   
 
19:56:59 
 
The board must propose spending cuts.  Congress could overrule the board, but only if it 
has a 3/5 majority in the Senate and the House or comes up with another plan to reduce 
costs.  The accountable care organization is second.  They are delivery models for 
doctors and hospitals to give them financial incentives to provide good quality

coordinated care to Medicare beneficiaries while keeping costs down.  They would 
benefit by sharing in savings with the government if costs are lower than projected for 
treating Medicare patients.  If higher, ACOs would have to pay back funds to the 
government.  It is my belief that doctors and hospitals will ration or deny care to seniors 
if they feel that their costs would exceed the ceiling.  ACOs are a giant HMO.   
 
Third is the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).  It is similar to NICE 
in the UK, a government agency that determines which treatments are cost effective as 
compared to medically effective.   
 
19:58:07 
 
While no one can deny that there are problems in American healthcare, a system that 
empowers doctors and patients will solve them, not the federal government.  I do think 
that everyone here would agree we all want affordable, acceptable quality care.  How 
do we achieve that goal?  Well, I believe there are two competing visions when it comes 
to healthcare reform and achieving universal coverage.  One focuses on doctors and 
patient-centered solutions.  The other focuses on increasing the role of government in 
our healthcare system.  That was President Obama's vision.  Liberal politicians, 
academics and the elite media tell Americans that socialized assistance such as exists in 
Canada and Europe are better and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all.   
 
19:58:56 
 
And while it is true that 5 percent or 2.5 million seniors in their last year of life consume 
25 percent of Medicare spending, it is still my belief it is not the government's place to 
limit costs by sacrificing lives.  End-of-life decisions should be made by doctors and 
families, not bureaucrats such as those on IPAB and PCORI.  They will ration the care our 
seniors receive, and I believe that is ethically and morally wrong.  In my view, people 
have every right to live as long as they can.  Therefore, I urge you to vote against the 
proposition.  Thank you.

And we are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate. 
 I'm John Donvan.  We have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this 
motion, "Ration end-of-life care."  You have heard the first two opening statements, and 
now on to the third.   
 
19:59:56

Debating for the motion, "Ration end-of-life care," the Ira W. DeCamp professor of 
bioethics at Princeton University, he's been called the most influential living philosopher 
by the New Yorker and is the author of a number of books including "The Life You Can 
Save" and "Animal Liberation."  Ladies and gentlemen, Peter Singer. 
 
[applause] 
 
Peter Singer:   
Thank you very much.  It's the position of our side that we are already rationing health 
care, so in a sense we can't really debate whether we should do so.  The question that 
we can discuss is whether we should be open and explicit about what we're doing, and, 
therefore, try to do it in the best, most thought-out way possible, which essentially 
means, "Do it in the way that gets the best value for the health dollars that we're 
spending now," or whether we should continue to do it in a way that we don't bring out 
in the open so we cover up, that we don't really dare to discuss.   
 
20:01:05 
 
And we can see that politically it's not really a topic that people dare to discuss openly, 
and as a result, more people will die who could be saved than will die if we use the 
money we're spending effectively.   
 
Now, it's clear that we are not spending our health dollars effectively in this country at 
present.  We spend about between 17 to 18 percent of everything we have, of our gross 
national product, on health care.  That's about 50 percent more than other comparable 
countries, the other industrialized countries that we compare ourselves with.  There is 
no evidence, no evidence that we get any better outcomes for the extra 50 percent that 
we're spending, the extra 7 or 8 percent of GDP that we're spending, than those other 
countries.  
 
20:02:08 
 
And Dr. Kellermann will give you a more detailed rebuttal to what Sally Pipes just said 
when she specifically focused on cancer in those remarks.  When we looked at not just 
what the health system does – but at health outcomes in America, we're actually 
terrible.  It's the combination of what the health system does and our general health. 
 We rank in terms of health outcomes somewhere around the level of countries like 
Slovenia and Costa Rica.  They are countries that are much poorer than we are, and yet 
their health outcomes are comparable to ours.  And the other industrialized nations 
have better health outcomes, including, incidentally, Canada.

It's also true -- it's also true that when you ask Canadians, as Gallop did a couple of years 
ago, and Americans, and Britons, people in the U.K., do they have confidence in their 
health care system, the Britons and the Canadians, 73 percent of them, just 
coincidentally the same number, say, "Yes," they do.  When you asked Americans, only 
56 percent of them say they do.  I think that there's a general feeling that this health 
care system is not delivering what we want.  But as I said it is rationing.  It rations in 
many ways.  For example, we about 44 million people, Americans, now, who are not 
insured at all.  That number will drop significantly when Obama Care comes into effect, 
but it will not unfortunately drop to zero.  Now, not being insured means that you are 
more likely to die if you have a serious illness or accident.  In fact, Joseph Doyle, a MIT 
scientist, looked at people who were brought into emergency care as a result of road 
accidents, seriously injured.   
 
20:04:04 
 
And found that those who were uninsured died at a higher rate even when adjusting for 
other variables than those who had insurance.  And when he calculated how much it 
would have cost to save these people's lives, it would have been about $280,000. 
 Reasonable amount of money.  But that was how much more was spent on saving the 
lives of the others.  But given that these were mostly fairly young people, in terms of 
how much it would have cost to extend their lives for one year, it would be about 
$5,500.  These people's lives were lost because we were not prepared $5,500 for each 
year of life that we could have saved.  Compare that with the amount that those much 
criticized bodies Sally Pipes mentioned NICE, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence 
in the United Kingdom.   
 
20:05:01 
 
What they say is too much to spend.  Apparently, NICE’s figure is around $49,000.  In 
other words, almost 10 times, nine times as much as would have saved the lives of these 
young accident victims.  And of course, we ration in a lot of other ways as well, because 
some people can't afford copayments.  We have long waiting times.  We don't pay 
doctors enough for Medicare, and so they don't take Medicare patients, or they don't 
take so many Medicare patients.  So we are losing lives, and we're losing lives that we 
could save quite cheaply. 
 
So I think we ought to be more explicit about this.  We ought to be prepared to say, 
"Let's use the dollars --" maybe we should spend more dollars.  I'm not necessarily 
opposed to spending more dollars.  But let's use the dollars we spend in the most 
effective way in order to save the greatest number of lives.

Something has to be done, because health care costs are rising here much faster than 
the economy is growing.  They're rising at 9.8 percent per annum.  We all know the 
economy is not growing at anything like that amount.  So as that keeps happening, 
what's going to happen?  It will eventually soak up all available spending.  But we know 
the government has to spend on other things.  On the [Intelligence Squared] website, in 
the articles that were posted.  There's a very moving piece by Ken Connor about the 
plight of elderly citizens in our country, how they are neglected, and how because of the 
demographic changes, there's going to be more of them.  Effectively, we need to spend 
a lot more to give our senior citizens a comfortable and dignified life when they can no 
longer look after themselves.  That costs money, and it's going to cost more money.   
 
20:06:54 
 
We cannot increase health care spending indefinitely and also spend more on the 
elderly and spend more on the environment, on education, on all of the other important 
things that we need.  So, like it nor not, we are rationing health care.  We are arguing 
that, indeed, we should.  That's obvious.  But whether we should be more explicit about 
it, because we want to get the best results we can.  We want to save the most number 
of lives that we can.  And the way to do that is to be explicit and vote yes for this 
motion.  We should be rationing health care.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan 
Thank you, Pete Singer.

And our final debater will be speaking against this motion.  It's Ken Connor.  Ken is 
chairman and founder of the Center for a Just Society.  He is a successful trial lawyer. 
 He represented Governor Jeb Bush in the long-running Terri Shiavo case, and for 
several years served as president of the Family Research Council.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
Ken Connor.

Ken Connor: 
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Sally Pipes' mother's situation is exhibit "A" for 
why Americans don't want the government to wind up rationing health care in this 
country.  By contrast, my mom suffered from advanced colon cancer late in life at an 
older age than Sally's mom.  She received aggressive treatment, both surgery and 
chemotherapy, made a full recovery, and went on to live more than a decade of a good 
and healthy life, until she finally died at 90 at home in good health in her own bed.  



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Which system would you prefer?  Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to make three points, if 
I may, about why government should not be in the business of rationing health care.   
 
First of all, health care decisions should be made at the end of life, just as at any other 
point in life, at the bedside, by the people involved and who are affected, not by 
bureaucrats at a remote location.   
 
20:09:02 
 
Secondly, that rationing is unethical, because it ultimately devalues human life and 
inevitably winds up punishing the sick and the dying.   
 
Thirdly rationing is the lazy man's way -- lazy man's attempt to balance the budget.  It's 
easier to balance the budget on the backs of the sick and dying than it is to reform your 
ways of wasteful spending in government and try to wrench money back from the hands 
of the special interests at home and abroad.  So back to the premises, first of all, that 
healthcare decisions should be made at the bedside.  Americans don't want 
bureaucratic bean counters in Washington making decisions about what kind of care 
they're going to wind up receiving at the end of life.  Decisions about healthcare and 
how it ought to be administered and when it ought to be administered ought to be 
decisions that are made by the patient informed by their doctors and by their families.   
 
20:10:07 
 
Decisions about what kind of care will be administered at any given time to any given 
patient should take into account the needs of the patient.  In other words, healthcare 
should be both individualized and particularized to the needs of the given patient.  A 
bureaucrat remote from the bedside, hundreds, perhaps thousands of miles away 
practicing assembly line medicine simply is not in a position to make those kinds of 
individualized decisions that are required.  These are decisions that have to be based 
real time, sometimes at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. in the morning as Dr. Kellermann has pointed 
out.  And it's the people who have their feet on their floor -- on the floor in the hospital 
and their hands on the patient who ought to be making these decisions.   
 
20:10:58 
 
There's simply no way that a government functionary practicing assembly line medicine 
in Washington can make those kinds of decisions.  Healthcare requires the fine edge of a 
scalpel, not the blunt end of an ax.  And patients don't want their doctors straight-
jacketed by some bureaucratic straightjacket fashioned in the federal city.  They want 
decisions made by doctors who are taking their interests into account.  They don't some 
interest that was decided in a smoke-filled room in Washington, in a room that was 
predominated by lobbyists to be the ones who are making the decisions.   
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And, folks, do we really want the men who are wearing the green eye shades in 
Washington to be making these kinds of decisions?  Should cost be the primary driver of 
such decision, especially in the zero sum environment that prevails in Washington?   
 
20:11:59 
 
I would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that when the tradeoffs are made, we 
don't want decisions about healthcare to go by the board in preference to a new start in 
green energy or some other pie in the sky kind of effort.  Now, no one is suggesting for a 
moment that we should not be good stewards of scarce healthcare resources.  We 
absolutely should be.  But rationing is not what we need.  It's rational care.  We ought to 
be asking ourselves, is the procedure under consideration necessary for the patient?  Is 
it clinically appropriate?  Is the cost reasonable compared to similar services?  These are 
questions that ought to be answered by people with their feet on the ground in the 
hospital in real time by hospitalization -- hospital utilization committees and not by 
people who are removed from the bedside.   
 
20:12:58 
 
Now, folks, make no mistake about it, government rationing represents the first step 
down the road to the utilitarian philosophy of former Colorado governor Richard Lamb 
who said, "The elderly have a duty to die and get out of the way."  This philosophy sees 
the elderly and the handicapped as resource hogs whose useful life is over and who now 
costs more to maintain than they produce.  They reject the sanctity of life ethics that 
has long prevailed in this country, and that maintains that every human life is precious 
and out to be respected and protected under the law.  That view affirms equal 
protection for all, the old, and the handicapped to the very young and to the very old. 
 Instead the quality of life advocates maintain that we should use quality of life calculus 
and functional capacity studies in deciding who lives and who dies.   
 
20:13:57 
 
Of course, the elderly and the handicapped who suffer from dementia and disability 
don't score well using those formulas.  And isn't that the point?  Ladies and gentlemen, 
what criteria will the all-wise bureaucrats use to pick winners and losers at the end of 
life? 
Will they be any more successful than they were in picking Solindra and Bright Source 
and Abound Solar on whom the government squandered billions of dollars?  But then 
again, what does it matter?  At the end of life, we're all going to die, right?   
 
Folks, I would suggest to you that there are many places that we can look to find the 
savings that we need to provide appropriate care for the sick and for the dying.  For 
heaven's sakes, we spent $4 trillion on the Wall Street bailout to rescue businesses that 
engaged in profligate spending practices.

20:14:56 
 
Surely, we can spend the money required to render appropriate healthcare to the sick 
and the dying.  Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote against the proposition 
because by the time you reach the end of your life, you'll be glad you did.  Thank you.

John Donvan 
Thank you, Ken Connor.  That concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. 
debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan 
Now we'll have the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions 
from me and from you in the audience, we have two teams of two.  Arthur Kellermann 
and Peter Singer are arguing for the motion:  "Ration end-of-life care."  And we have 
heard them say basically that we already are rationing, that healthcare is rationed right 
now by the ability to pay for it by the individual and that it is time to be explicit, to 
ration in a different way, to step up and admit that's what we're doing and figure out a 
system for doing it.   
 
20:15:59 
 
They say that you need to figure out how much saving a life produces in terms of 
results.  You have to compare that to how the resources could be used elsewhere.  The 
team arguing against the motion, Sally Pipes and Ken Connor, argue that rationing end-
of-life care is the wrong way to balance the budget.  They say that it would be falling to 
government bureaucrats to make intensely personal decisions, that cost should not be 
the driver of a decision regarding the end of life, and that they depict a future where 
basically the elderly will be thrown overboard.  Now, I notice that the two sides do agree 
that cost cutting needs to happen, that costs are out of control.  They do agree that 
ideally these decisions will be made at the bedside by doctors and their families.  The 
question is, who ends up controlling where the money comes from.  And I want to put 
to the side arguing in support of rationing end-of-life care, particularly to Peter Singer, 
this basic question:  Is there a way actually to arrive at a dollar value for what a few 
more months of life would be worth to an elderly person versus what it would be worth 
to a younger person?  
 
20:17:08 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And does that explain whether -- does that price carry over to whether a procedure is 
worth pursuing or not?  Can you put a dollar number on these things? 
 
Peter Singer:   
It's very difficult to agree on dollar numbers.  I mean, healthcare economists try to do it 
because really what they're doing is they're comparing what you get for your money if 
you spend it on one thing, let's say saving young people's lives and what you get for 
your dollar if you spend it on something else, perhaps let's say for cancer where it can 
only extend life by two or three months at significant expense.  And I think what they 
can clearly say is we get better value in some cases rather than others.  We extend lives 
for longer for the same amount, or we extend lives for an equal amount for less money. 
 
20:17:55 
 
John Donvan 
You said in your opening remarks that younger lives are less expensive generally 
speaking to save than older lives with the outcome of a longer life lived because the 
person's younger rather than older.  Am I reading you correctly? 
 
Peter Singer:   
Well, I think most of us would agree that it's a greater tragedy if a 20-year-old dies 
because they're in an accident and didn't have health insurance than if an 85-year-old 
dies.  I think, you know, we would feel that people have lived most of their life, achieved 
most of what they're going to achieve when they die in their 80s, let's say.  It's still sad, 
of course.  I know it's sad.  But it's a greater tragedy.  It's worth spending more to 
prevent if we can save the life of somebody who still has most of their life in front of 
them and still has a lot of things that they can achieve. 
 
John Donvan 
All right.  Sally Pipes I'd like your response to that in light of your saying in your opening 
remarks that each of us has the right to live as long as we can.  Does age come into it? 
 Do the young -- do the younger have more of a right to live as long as they can than the 
older? 
 
Sally Pipes:   
No.  I believe we all have the right to live as long as we can.  Only when someone has 
died can we actually measure the cost of what the cost of keeping that person alive is.  
 
20:19:02 
 
But I think that people should be able to get the best healthcare they can and not have 
their care rationed by government bureaucrats.  But you know, we all want to live 
longer lives, have affordable, accessible quality care.  How do we do that?  Well, we 
have to make some changes to our health care system.  I believe in empowering doctors 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

and patients, making changes to Medicare and Medicaid, changing the tax treatment 
because for people who have -- 
 
John Donvan 
Sally, can I interrupt?  But you made that point in your opening statement.  And I want 
to kind of keep on this question that the other side has raised about -- and you were 
beginning on it -- on this question of older versus younger, that they're -- what they're 
constructing is the notion that if you save the life of a person who then lives for 50 
years, that, therefore, there's more value in that than saving the life of a person who 
lives for two years.  You get 25 more years of life out of it.  And it's a mathematical 
calculation.  And I want to know how that sits with you, that -- to take math and dollars -
- and dollar figures to apply to these very sensitive issues. 
 
20:20:03 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Well, I would say I don't think we should be using mathematics to determine this.  We 
should give people the best opportunity to get the best care that they can, regardless of 
their age.  I mean, if you take an issue like infant mortality, people assume and probably 
will say, "Well, infant mortality is much higher in the U.S. than it is in countries in 
Europe," but you have to compare apples with apples.  You know, Americans have -- we 
have the best neonatal care.  When the children live -- survive a lot more in this country 
because they have this good neonatal care, in countries in Europe, they determine that 
as a fetus or a newborn, if under a certain weight and a certain length, they're not 
counted as a live birth.  So I think we don't want to put dollars and cents on this.  We 
want to give everyone the best possible care.  And how we get there is -- well, we can 
talk about it a little bit later. 
 
John Donvan 
All right.  And Ken Connor, your partner. 
 
Ken Connor: 
John, I'd like to weigh in against that kind of a calculating.   
 
20:20:59 
 
In America, we hold to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Equal protection 
under the law is the hallmark of American justice.  And I would suggest to you that any 
point of view that says that a person's dignity diminishes with age or that somehow 
their personhood erodes as they get older is a point of view really that is a bankrupt 
point of view.  And inevitably that point of view will endanger everyone who reaches old 
age or anyone who should suffer from the slings and arrows of misfortune and wind up 
suffering a serious illness or injury. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Peter Singer: 
But we haven't said their dignity is less or that their personhood is less.  What we said is 
that they have less years to live.  And that's a different question. 
 
Ken Connor: 
Well, let me ask you this point, if I may, you've been an apologist in your book -- in your 
books for infanticide, making the point that disabled infants who lack rationality or the 
capacity to grasp that they existed over time or that they lack some form of self 
consciousness were somehow not persons and could be disposed of, indeed you've 
gone so far as to make that argument about all newborn infants, maintaining that within 
a period of, say, 28 days after birth, parents should be able to decide to get rid of them 
or not. 
 
20:22:25 
 
Peter Singer: 
Point of order. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
My question would be -- 
 
Peter Singer: 
Point of order. 
 
This is not the topic we're debating tonight, but I'm happy to debate it some other time. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Ken Connor:   
Well, it is the topic.  
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to give Ken a chance to relate it.   
 
Ken Connor: 
And here's the point I would make, old people who suffer from dementia often lack self 
awareness.  They often lack the capacity for rationality.  They often lack the capacity to 
grasp the notion that they exist over time.  Would you declare them non-persons and 
say that they are not worthy of protection and preservation, as you have in the case of -- 
 
John Donvan 
Okay, Art Kellermann, because I'm not hearing them make the argument in that 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

extreme way, but I want to -- 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
I just got to get a couple of things sorted out here.  I'm easily confused. 
 
[laughter] 
 
First of all, I want to make sure I came to the right debate tonight because I came here 
to debate whether -- how we approach end-of-life care.  I did not -- I just want to make 
sure I'm at the right debate, because I'm not here to debate Solyndra, Wall Street, 
ObamaCare, or the presidential election. 
 
[applause] 
 
I'm just confused, but I'm southern, and we're easily confused.  So second question is 
are we here to debate an elderly person's right to super expensive care paid for by the 
government versus simply very expensive care that we all agree is probably a 
reasonable deal, or are we here to debate whether or not poor people and other folks 
can get decent care versus no care, because I personally believe in the sanctity of life, 
but I think the sanctity of life extends beyond birth and goes all the way up and doesn't 
sort of kick in again the last few weeks before death.   
 
20:24:09 
 
It extends throughout life for the uninsured, the poor, and working class folks, too.   
And they should be part of this discussion. 
 
Ken Connor: 
Exactly my point.  And the point is, we're going to use some kind of criteria to decide 
who lives and who dies.  And for instance, if the eminent Dr. Singer were to become the 
rationer in chief in the next administration, what criteria would he use?  Would we look 
at the elderly, the demented, the disabled and say that their quality of life years don't 
merit preserving their lives?  Would we say that, as in the case of the infants that he's 
identified, that they are not persons whose lives are worthy of protection and 
preservation?  Ideas have consequences.  What we believe determines how we behave, 
and this logic applies at the end of life no less so than at the beginning.

Let's take one specific part of your question that relates most closely to this motion, to 
Peter.  And, you know, if you were the rationer in chief -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 -

Peter Singer:   
That's not a very likely scenario. 
 
John Donvan 
No, it's unlikely to happen for anyone.  But do you have a system?  Or do you have the 
outlines of a system?  Do you have a philosophy about how this should be approached? 
 
Peter Singer:   
I would try to look at the number of years that we can expect to extend people's lives 
for a given number of dollars.  I would also try to look at the quality of life as well.  Now, 
that certainly may be affected by dementia, but, in addition, especially with older 
people, I would hope that they would be encouraged to state their own wishes as to 
what should happen to them if they become demented, or if other things happen to 
them. 
 
John Donvan 
But, Peter, assuming that you're correct, that you're not going to get the job, what body 
do you see making the decisions? 
 
Peter Singer:   
So I think, actually, although it's much criticized, I think that the U.K. model of setting up 
-- they have a National Institute for Clinical Excellence.   
 
20:26:04 
 
Sally referred to it by its acronym, NICE.  Not everybody thinks it's nice.  But what they 
do is, they try to cost the various treatments that are out there, and they try to get 
expert data on how long those treatments extend life in a variety of different 
conditions, and they make recommendations.  They're not binding, but they make 
recommendations to the local area health authorities throughout the United Kingdom 
to suggest that this treatment does give value for the money; you should be providing it. 
 But perhaps this treatment for this specific condition is above the bar that we think 
reasonable, and you may consider not providing that.  And the health authorities then 
reach those decisions. 
 
John Donvan 
And how often -- if you happen to know -- how often is there a recommendation not to 
use a particular intervention or treatment?  Is it uncommon, or is it pretty common? 
 
20:26:55 
 
Peter Singer:   
It's relatively common that there are some treatments for some specific conditions that 
are considered too expensive to provide.  And I think that that's going to be inevitable, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 -

because medical technology really has no limits to how much it can cost, and the drug 
companies can charge more.  In fact, drugs are much cheaper in the United Kingdom 
because the manufacturers know that if they price them very high, they're not going to 
be recommended by NICE, whereas here they can basically charge whatever they like, 
and they're still going to get users. 
 
John Donvan 
Let's hear from your opponent Sally Pipes. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
So you are a proponent of NICE, which I think the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research 
Institute is patterned after, but if you read the British press about people -- the quality-
adjusted value of life.  If you're, say, 68 years old and the actuaries within the National 
Health Service bureaucracy say, "Your life is worth $49,000."  You may have been 
diagnosed with a severe cancer, macular degeneration, but if the drugs to take care of 
this are costing more than $49,000, you are denied care in the United Kingdom.   
 
20:28:00 
 
Read the British press, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail, any of it.  People are 
complaining all the time, even ex-employees at the National Health Service will say, "It's 
wrong that we cannot get the care we need because it may be medically effective but 
it's not cost-effective."  And on the issue of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, yes, 
drugs and medical devices are cheaper in Canada and in the U.K. and other countries in 
Europe.  They don't develop these drugs and medical devices.  The United States is the 
entrepreneurial capital for developing drugs and pharmaceuticals.  Pharmaceuticals cost 
about $1.3 billion from the idea until it gets through.  These other countries -- Canada, 
Britain -- they free-ride off our R&D, and it is wrong. 
 
John Donvan 
Sally, one question for you when you were describing what the British are doing, saying 
no to certain procedures that are not considered cost-effective or not effective enough 
to justify the cost.  Don't insurance companies do that all the time? 
 
20:28:57 
 
[applause] 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Yes, insurance companies make decisions based on actuarial evidence.  Would you 
prefer the government to making decisions about what drugs and treatments you can't, 
or would you prefer the private sector and insurance companies to make those 
decisions?  I, personally, want insurance companies -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[laughter] 
 
I prefer insurance companies.    
 
John Donvan 
Well, you know -- let's -- let's show some respect to this -- can you -- why would you 
prefer the private sector to do it, to the government? 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Because the private sector provides all things that we -- we can make decisions about 
what kind of cell phones we want, what kind of bank accounts we want.  The private 
sector is always good.  But the problem in this country is that 50 percent of our 
healthcare today is already in the hands of government through Medicare, Medicaid, 
CHIP and the VA system.  We don't have a private market.  We need to move to a three-
year market, get insurance away from employers.  60 percent of Americans have their 
healthcare through their employer.  And if they don't like the plan or whatever, you're 
stuck with that.  But if you lose your job, you lose your insurance, you go into the private 
market, you have to buy your insurance with after-tax dollars.   
 
20:30:04 
 
I want to see the tax code changed so that we can move to a more individualized basis 
on health insurance just like our car insurance, our life insurance, our long-term care 
insurance.  This is the way America works.  It's what makes America great.  And we don't 
want to move to a Canadian style single-payer system which I think the president, Nancy 
Pelosi and Harry Reid, that is their ultimate goal. 
 
John Donvan 
Let me ask -- 
 
Sally Pipes:   
We will have Medicare for all. 
 
John Donvan 
Let me ask your partner, Ken Connor this point.  We do have smaller versions of single 
payer systems.  We have Medicare, we have the Veterans Administration.  They have to 
make decisions.  They have to cut costs.  Do they need to -- do they need to have a 
system of rationing in the system that exists now as opposed to -- as opposed to what 
you're proposing a solution which just is not the world that we're in today? 
 
Ken Connor: 
Well, I think it's important to understand, as a practical matter, the truth of the notion 
that he who pays the piper gets to call the tune.  And so it's a practical matter. 
 Whoever's making those payments, in large measure, is going to call the shots.

20:31:05 
 
What we advocate, though, in contrast to a central bureaucratized, central planning, 
decision making process is that we have consumer-driven decision making, informed by 
medical advice, mediated by markets.  We believe that that system is a better system 
than the government system.  We believe that that system is a better system and that 
those -- that's a better way to make decisions than relegating it to the people who 
brought us the bridge to nowhere, Solyndra, the Wall Street bailout.  Now, look -- look, 
folks, plain and simple.  There's an economic concept that our physician friend may not 
be aware of.  It's called opportunity cost.  And -- and your proposition assumes the 
fallacy of only two alternatives:  Either we recoup the money from the sick and dying, or 
we don't.   
 
20:32:02 
 
But my point is there are other ways to recoup the money from other areas where we 
are wasting money.  And it's much easier to balance budgets on the back of the sick and 
dying than to wrench it out of the hands of the special interests in Washington. 
 
John Donvan 
Arthur Kellermann. 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
I'm real glad I got a chance to talk. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
Let's talk for just a moment about exhibit A, Sally.  As a doctor, I've got to tell you, I've 
heard that story before.  And I don't think – 
 
John Donvan: 
Remind people just tuning in to -- 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
Oh, yes.  The story earlier about your mother not getting the colonoscopy she needed. 
 And I feel badly about what happened.  But I have to tell you, I don't think a 
government bureaucrat was the one who made the mistake.  I think you got a bad doc. 
 And the fact of the matter is -- I know this may come as a shock, sometimes Canadians 
screw up.  If they didn't, we'd never win the Stanley Cup. 
 
20:32:55

[laughter] 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
And Mr. Connor -- 
 
Sally Pipes:   
And Canadians are really nice people. 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
Yeah. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
And they are very patient, not like patients in need. 
 
20:33:03 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
Yeah.  Mr. Connor -- I'm with you, brother, on the market incentive.  So let me suggest a 
market-based solution to what we're talking about.  I think there's a big difference 
between deciding what we as a society can afford to commit folks to get, whether it's in 
ICU at the end of the life or whether it's at 25 years old when you're trying to get your 
first job and starting a family.  And let's commit to that level of financial protection and 
coverage that we all kind of want to buy into.  If beyond that, whatever that is, whatever 
we as a country decide we are prepared to shoulder, you can buy it.  Sally, you could 
buy it.  If you want Avastin, and it's worth $100,000 a year to pay for it out of your 
pocket, and you want to use your children's inheritance, go for it.  It's okay with me.  But 
I've got a problem with you using our inheritance to buy your Avastin if we don't have 
the evidence that it makes a difference. 
 
20:33:58 
 
[applause] 
 
So let's have a market-based solution.  That's the deal today that 50 million uninsured 
Americans get, except they don't even get a basic level of coverage.  It's all out of 
pocket, or it's on the charity and mercy of individual doctors and hospitals.  That's a 
pretty lousy deal. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Well, when you analyze the 48.6 million Americans who are uninsured, it doesn't mean 
they don't get healthcare.  Anyone in this country under [unintelligible] the federal law 
can turn up an emergency room -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Arthur Kellermann:   
I know we take care of them. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
So but let's look at that 48.6 million.  14 million of them are people who are eligible for 
Medicaid and CHIP and haven't signed up.  We're going to be adding 11 to 12 million 
more to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.  Why have these people not signed up 
for Medicaid?  Well, I believe doctors are reimbursed 35 to 42 percent below what they 
get from treating private patients.  So Medicaid patients find it very difficult to get a 
doctor.  This is only going to get worse.   
 
20:35:00 
 
The other point is that there are about 20 million of these people are people that are 
young people, like a lot of you in this audience.  You're between 18 and 31.  You're the 
young invincible.  You don't want to spend $400 to $500 a month on healthcare.  So you 
don't.  You'll pay out of pocket when you need it.  There are only about 9 million 
Americans who are chronically ill without health insurance for a period of two years or 
more.  Those are the people that I want to take care of and that we should be taking 
care of.  But you know, in the UK, in the country, if you decide that you want to buy 
Avastin because the actuaries have said your quality adjusted value of life is not worth 
the 80 to 90,000 a year for Avastin, you can pay out of pocket.  But you are then out of 
the national health service.  The government says you cannot get any more treatment 
from the government.  And I feel that is not fair. 
 
Peter Singer:   
Yeah, but we don't support that system.  I mean, that's not -- 
 
Sally Pipes:   
I know.  But this is what -- under the PCORI under IPAB, under accountable care, this is 
what is going to happen to people in this country. 
 
John Donvan 
Let me bring in Peter.  Let me bring in Peter Singer. 
 
20:36:00 
 
Peter Singer:   
Well, let me just say, I mean, I've spent most of my life in Australia as you can probably 
tell from the funny way I speak.  And we have universal health coverage, but we also 
have private insurance.  It's not like Canada.  You're not out of the Medicare, as we call 
it.  You're not out of that scheme by taking out private insurance.  It just gives you, if you 
want to do that, extra coverage for various things that you can do.  So it's an option and 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 -

-- 
 
John Donvan 
All right.  I don't feel I'm doing a very good job as moderator tonight. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan 
I'm sorry.  Because I want to shape this back to what we're talking about as a tradeoff of 
what you get for what you pay, and are you willing to pay it, and is it wrong to deny that 
payment?  And I -- you know, Ken Connor, you actually did put your finger on it when 
you said that, he who is paying the cost gets to call the tunes on this.  And right now we 
are in a world where Medicare is taking care of an awful lot of people.  And it's very 
expensive.  We know a crisis is coming.   
 
20:36:57 
 
Given where we are on that, their argument that at some point you have to say no, and 
let's figure out a way to say no, and let's make it fair for everybody, which is the 
principle of rationing, that if there's not enough of something to go around, you set up a 
system so that everybody gets an equal shot at it.  But everybody doesn't get all of what 
they want.  Just -- just that concept, what do you think of -- what is wrong with that? 
 Because I know you think that it's wrong. 
 
Ken Connor:   
Well, I think you're talking about fundamental fairness here.  Let's think of it in these 
terms:  How fair is it when you pay into something all your life, you get to the end of 
your life, when you really need it, you've been told that you're paying in to receive 
healthcare, and you get down to the point when you really need it and say -- and the 
government says, "Sorry, you're going to cost us too much."  Isn't there a fundamental 
fairness issue in that regard?  No.  We're going to take the money that you paid in over 
time, over all these years, and we're going to give it to younger people because they 
don't need as much of it as you do.  Isn't that why we paid into it all of our lives?  Isn't 
that -- isn't that part of fundamental fairness, is getting what you pay for? 
 
20:38:03 
 
John Donvan 
Okay.  And the question we'll put to this side out of this is that he's actually portraying 
what sounds like a very ugly situation.  You're old, you're -- you got two years left.  We 
got a limited amount of money.  That group of kids over there, they've got all their lives 
in front of you.  Sorry, Charlie.  You're off the boat.  It does sound ugly, nasty, and very 
hard to take.  And I want you to take on that side of the argument.

Arthur Kellermann:   
Well, the only problem is that's not how it works, and that's not what we're talking 
about. 
 
John Donvan 
That is what we're talking about. 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
I mean, we're talking about, again -- 
 
John Donvan 
No, it is -- but, Art, it's -- we are talking about having to make these hard choices and 
saying no to some people. 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
Yeah, well, no, what we're saying is we want to give everybody good, decent, high-
quality, evidence-based medicine and care, including and especially palliative care at the 
end of life.  But if you want a super expensive drug or an unorthodox treatment, it costs 
a freaking fortune. 
 
20:38:57 
 
And it is way beyond what we think as a society private insurance’s actuaries or the 
government's actuaries or the institute of medicine says is reasonable, then we should 
not, as a society, be obliged to go along for the ride.  You should be able to pay for that 
out of pocket or in any other way you want to do it.  That's a fundamental difference in 
saying, "No, you can't have it at all."  And let me remind you, we talked about wasteful 
spending earlier -- 
 
John Donvan 
But wasn't Peter describing a situation in the U.K. where they do look at specific 
treatments and they say, "If you want to stay in the national health, you can't have it at 
all"? 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
Well, I'm sorry.  I thought we were in the United States.

John Donvan 
But Peter used the United Kingdom system as an example so I think it’s on the table -- 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
Well, yeah, but let me just mention something that I think we’ve got to put on the table 
because I don't know how much time we're going to have, a cynical colleague of mine 
once said, "Americans don't mind throwing people overboard, they just don't like to 
hear the splash." 
 
[laughter] 
 
And there's an awful lot of people that are getting thrown overboard every day in this 
country that we're not debating about tonight.  
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
20:40:02 
 
No, no, it's really important.  Sally told a story -- I'll just briefly tell a story.  Early in my 
career, I saw a woman in her 30s, a mother of three, who rolled in the door with a 
hemorrhagic stroke, her blood vessel burst in her brain, she was neurologically 
devastated.  We incubated her, we did everything that Sally and Ken would want.  We 
gave her a full court all out best we could humanly do, and we could not save her life.  I 
went to break the news to her sisters, and they told me that three weeks earlier she'd 
lost her job, lost her coverage, could not afford her three blood pressure medicines, and 
was forced to choose between groceries for her kids or medicine for herself.  She chose 
her kids like any mother in this audience would choose, and she paid for it with her life. 
 Her life had value.  She died.  We spent more money in the last three hours of a 
completely futile effort to save her life that could have kept her in blood pressure 
medicine her whole life, raised her kids, paid her taxes, contributed to our country. 
 Those people matter, too! 
 
20:41:09 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan 
I want to take questions from the audience, but I just want to finish this up.  Should she 
have been denied that service since it didn't make sense economically? 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
What?

John Donvan 
The extraordinary effort -- 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
No, because early on you don't know how things are going to turn out and you -- but at 
some point you say -- and, again, what we said -- opening conversation here is the most 
important discussion to have is between a physician and the patient with an honest 
sharing of information, not get pulled into an industrial complex of modern medicine. 
 Just remember, we were talking about the Affordable Care Act or Obama Care earlier. 
 One of the first provisions that got knocked out of it was one that would have given 
doctors a little money every six months to encourage them to have a conversation with 
their patients. 
 
20:41:57 
 
[applause] 
 
And you know what we called this, folks?  We called it a "death panel."  What the hell 
was that about? 
 
Ken Connor: 
Let me ask you this question. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
I don't know 10 doctors in America that thought that was a good idea to knock that out. 
 
John Donvan 
I'm going to let Ken respond.  I think you're going with the question, so, yeah, make it a 
question -- 
 
Ken Connor: 
If I may, you've made the point, and you've written about it, it's a good point, that some 
15,000 people die estimated every year because of the lack of insurance coverage. 
 Easy.  Then probably due to medicine estimates that 100,000 people die a year from 
medical malpractice.  Are you willing to be as aggressive about reforming medical 
malpractice and ensuring that physicians meet the standard of care for those 100,000 as 
you are to argue for the 1,000s who don't survive because of a lack of insurance?

Arthur Kellermann:   
Absolutely.  Sign me up.  And you know what?  And while we're at it, let's cut out the 
$750 billion a year that the Institute of Medicine says our health care system, the one I 
work in, is wasting due to inefficiency, wasteful management, missed opportunities for  
prevention, and fraud, $750 billion, folks.  We could do a lot of good with that money. 
 
John Donvan 
And right then and, if you'll wait a second, a mike will come to you and you can stand 
up, if you wouldn't mind telling us your name, and just wait for the mic.  Thanks. 
 
Female Speaker:   
I have a question for Sally.  Sally, you -- 
 
John Donvan 
Can you just identify -- 
 
Female Speaker:   
Right.  Oh, I'm sorry, John.  My name is Judith Alexander.  Sally, you were running 
through how many people are uninsured who could actually receive government 
assistance if they applied for it.  But aren't you being inconsistent, because aren't you 
against a single payer and yet you seem to be advocating that many of the uninsured 
take advantage of the programs that really are single payers? 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Well, first of all -- 
 
John Donvan 
I think I'll pass on the question because I don't think this goes to the issue of rationing 
unless you want to rephrase. 
 
20:44:00 
 
Female Speaker:   
Don't single payers ration? 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Yes, definitely, in terms of rationed care, waiting lists, and lack of access to the latest 
treatments. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Everyone in America is entitled to health care by turning up at an emergency room.  And 
the real -- the hidden tax is not on the uninsured.  It's on the low reimbursement rates 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -

by government to doctors and hospitals.  That adds about 10 percent to the cost of an 
insurance plan by people who have private plans.  The uninsured only adds 1 percent to 
the cost of premiums for those who have insurance. 
 
John Donvan 
Response from the other side?  You don’t need to if you don’t want to.  Art Kellermann. 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
No, just -- we don't do a really good job of giving chemotherapy and doing a lot of other 
stuff in ERs.  I mean, I love practicing emergency medicine.  That is the last place that 
poor and uninsured Americans should have to go to get their health care.  It doesn't 
make any sense, and it never has. 
 
20:44:59 
 
[applause] 
 
And it just boggles the mind.  I'm sorry.  I'll have to recalibrate.  I've heard some things 
that have really got me spinning on this side and I need a moment to figure it out. 
 
John Donvan 
All right.  Sir. 
 
Male Speaker:   
My name's Patrick Bachelor [spelled phonetically].  First, to Sally.  Your story was both 
tragic -- I think it's irrelevant, unfortunately.  Obama Care is very different than the 
Canadian model, both in terms of who pays for it as well as how it's structured.  But to 
the other side -- 
 
John Donvan 
Don't debate the debaters, please.  Just ask your question.  Put the question. 
 
Male Speaker:   
Yeah.  The trick part of the question, I think, tonight is, do we really know what end-of-
life is until we get there? 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
There are many, many cases -- I never try to predict for an individual patient.  But what I 
do tell a patient is, "This is the situation.  This is what could happen.  What do you think 
is the right thing to do?"  And I respect their wishes, and I respect the family's wishes.

But you've got to give them honest information.  You've got to give people a sense of 
odds.  Everybody is one or zero as an individual, but the odds and the outcome and the 
prognosis really matter, and people need to understand what they're signing up for. 
 Ken talked earlier about cruel and unusual punishment.  If we took prisoners on death 
row and subjected them to a week in an American ICU, the Supreme Court would rule 
that unconstitutional.  So it's important to make your choice based on your values.  And 
my advice to you, sir, is to go home tonight and talk to your wife and kids and tell them 
what you want at the end of the life, so they'll be there to represent your views. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan 
I just want to understand, was the thrust of your question, "Who knows what a 
procedure is going to produce?" 
 
Male Speaker:   
No, it's, "How do you know when you're at that point, at end-of-life?" 
 
John Donvan 
Okay.  All right, so I think he just answered it.  Thank you.  Sir, go ahead. 
 
Male Speaker:   
My name's Tom Oldfield [spelled phonetically].  Great job, everybody.  It was very 
entertaining.  I'm holding my phone because I wrote the question on there, but -- 
 
John Donvan 
Could you move the mic a little closer? 
 
20:47:03 
 
Male Speaker:   
Yeah, absolutely.  Sorry about that.  Thinking in two hypotheticals.  One, we're thinking 
60 years down the road, and the other being that the stereotype that Gen-Y all think 
they’re special is true.  Which scenario do you think would be more likely? "A," as a 
result of our lives being so special, that the pool of end-of-life candidates would become 
so extreme down the road that we have no choice but to make reforms, and have this 
discussion and ration life care?  Or "B," would -- as a result of having such a comfortable 
life, would the -- would the effect of the suffering that goes on during end-of-life 
become so extreme where the conversation actually switches to people -- do people 
have the capacity for -- to choose euthanasia, for example?  Would there be a demand 
for that?

John Donvan 
Let's take Ken Connor first on that. 
 
Ken Connor: 
I'm not sure I understood your question fully, and I apologize for that. 
 
John Donvan 
Can I restate?  You're talking about, are we going to go to a world where -- well, the 
second scenario you were talking about, are we bound to a world where there are so 
many sick and elderly people, and we are so unable to pay for it, that people are going 
to be encouraged to off themselves?  That's what you were asking? 
 
Male Speaker:   
No.  It's actually -- It's actually more of sort of the -- I think of just killing as an example 
of when your quality of life, the drop-off of your quality of life is greater because of your 
upbringing, so having a more comfortable upbringing would naturally lead to a greater 
suffering, even though it's -- 
 
John Donvan 
Yeah, I'm going to pass on the question, because I think there's so many premises that 
we would end up ripping apart, addressing the many premises.  So I'm going to pass on 
it, but thank you. 
 
20:49:00 
 
Male Speaker:   
Can you at least talk about the euthanasia? 
 
John Donvan 
Sure.  All right. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Ken Connor: 
I'll be happy to address that.  Historically, in America, we have maintained that humans -
- you know, it's a self-evident truth that human beings are endowed by their creators 
with certain inalienable rights, the first of which is the right to life.  That right to life has 
been deemed to be the foundation of all other rights because if you don't preserve it, 
you don't get to enjoy any of the others.  Now, I fear that rationing opens the door to 
euthanasia because decisions are made on a utilitarian basis about who lives and who 
dies.  And that's the reason I injected the issue on the front end of this debate about 
personhood.   
 
20:50:02 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 -

Because Dr. Singer has maintained that if you lack certain qualities, rationality, the 
capacity to reflect on your own existence, self-awareness, you're not a person.  And he 
makes the point that if you're not a person, then it is not as morally culpable to destroy 
that entity than it otherwise would be for -- 
 
John Donvan 
But Ken, he's not -- he's not making that argument. 
 
Ken Connor: 
Well, my point ultimately goes to this:  Is that when we use these utilitarian criterion to 
decide who lives and who dies effectively, we wind up redefining who a person is and -- 
and that gives rise to a potential license to kill which invites euthanasia. 
 
John Donvan 
Peter Singer. 
 
Peter Singer:   
Well, if I can comment on that, I think what we are increasingly finding, and we will in 
the future, if you're looking to the future, is that more people want to have the right to 
make their own decisions about when they die, about when they've had enough.   
 
20:51:02 
 
[applause] 
 
Peter Singer:   
At the moment, people generally can say, "I don't want any more treatment."  But if 
there isn't treatment that's keeping them alive, they don't have that choice.  Now the 
citizens of Oregon, the citizens of Washington state, have voted in favor of having that 
right, at least to get a physician to prescribe the medicine that they know will be lethal 
that can end their life.  The courts in Montana have said that citizens there have that 
right as well.  There are several nations in Europe that allow that and also allow -- some 
of them allow a doctor to give a lethal injection as well on the request of the patient, 
satisfying certain conditions like a second opinion.  Those countries are satisfied with 
that.  In the Netherlands, for example, that's been the case for at least 20 years now. 
 And through different governments, through liberal governments, through conservative 
governments, through a Catholic prime minister who never tried to repeal that law 
because he knew it was too popular and would be political suicide if he did.   
 
20:52:05 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

So I think that that is actually something that probably is increasingly going to happen as 
people start to see that this is something that they want for themselves.  But that's a 
matter of choice.  That's not a matter of rationing. 
 
John Donvan 
I want to remind you that we are in the question-and-answer section of this Intelligence 
Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John Donvan.  We have four debaters, two teams of two, who 
are debating this motion:  Ration end-of-life care.  Peter Singer, I had the sense that Ken 
Connor's point wasn't about voluntary euthanasia, and I think the question was also 
about a culture in which euthanasia becomes a suggestion overhanging the elderly as 
they become more and more in number and as they become more difficult to take care 
of, that this sort of -- I think the question is, will we get to a world once we open the 
world to explicit rationing where an old person will know that it's time to get on the ice 
flow and get the pushout. 
 
20:52:58 
 
Peter Singer:   
No, I don't believe so.  I think there's still going to be the possibility of choosing, 
providing, of course, as you're saying, that you're not imposing a huge burden on other 
people by opting for something very expensive and of doubtful benefits.  So there are 
going to be limits there.  But I think otherwise people are going to be able to make their 
choices in accordance with their own values, and there will be some people who'll want 
to hang on to life as long as possible and other people who will say, life has lost 
whatever quality is had that I think makes it worth living, and I think it's time to go. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
But don't you think, Peter, that these decisions should be made between doctors and 
family and the patient in conjunction?  And living wills is an area that is expanding 
because if you have a living will, you can say so that when you're very ill you won't -- it's 
not as if you're under anesthetic or under drugs, you've actually made a decision.  I 
know it's hard to figure out when that time will be, but I think living wills are a great way 
to put things down.   
 
20:54:00 
 
But I think doctors and families and the person who is ill should be making these 
decisions.  And we shouldn't be so concerned about the cost to the system because we 
have a lot of weight in our system right now. 
 
Peter Singer:   
Yeah, I entirely agree.  The decisions about living and about voluntary euthanasia should 
be matters between doctors and patients.  And that's why I think they're separate from 
decisions about costs and about when treatment is imposing so much of a burden on 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 -

others and on the general health budget that it's not something that the public should 
be paying for. 
 
John Donvan 
So are we, or I, confusing euthanasia, which is a deliberate act to end life, with the 
withdrawal of an extraordinary measure which the patient hopes will save his or her 
life?  Are those two different things? 
 
Peter Singer:   
They are somewhat different things, certainly.  Again, I think patients should have those 
choices, and patients might choose that they don't want life support even though that is 
considered sufficiently cost effective to be worth providing.  But that should be a choice. 
 
20:55:04 
 
John Donvan 
Okay. 
 
Peter Singer:   
But they are different. 
 
John Donvan 
Ma'am, sorry.  I didn't see you. 
 
Female Speaker:   
My name is Julie Goldstein.  I am a palliative care physician and educator.  And my 
question is to all of you, but particularly Dr. Kellermann.  I see first hand all the way till 
that happens, particularly at the end of -- 
 
John Donvan 
Sorry.  Could you move the mic just a little closer? 
 
Female Speaker:   
Sure. 
 
John Donvan 
Thanks. 
 
Female Speaker:   
And my question is, do you think that if we were to address the waste head on by 
education, et cetera, that we might save enough money that we wouldn't even need to 
feel -- we wouldn't have the need to ration? 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Arthur Kellermann:   
I'm glad you brought that up.  I really believe that if we focused on getting rid of bad 
medicine and eliminating the kind of errors in communication problems that I discussed 
and reinforced the sustained palliative care, that takes care of 90 percent of this issue.  
 
20:55:59 
 
And the rest of it really does come down to a doctor, a patient and their family and what 
is meaningful and mattering to them.  There may well be in a point in society where we 
have to say that if the other certain amount of dollar value you can pay for it yourself 
that Medicare or private insurance or whatever won't go past that point.  But I'm never 
going to get between an American and their wallet.  It's my wallet or your wallet I'm 
more concerned about in that very unusual circumstance.  I just want to double back to 
the comment about euthanasia and say as a doctor, I'm not ready to go there.  But if a 
patient tells me, in their terminal condition, that they don't want an oxygen mask 
because they want to kiss their wife, I want to let them kiss their wife. 
 
John Donvan 
Okay.  Ken Connor. 
 
Ken Connor: 
Well, I affirm, doctor, that the premises of your question, which is if we can eliminate 
the waste broadly abused, doesn't that obviate the need for rationing?  And that was 
the point I tried to make in my opening statement, is that the alternative is not simply 
ration or not.   
 
20:57:07 
 
The question is whether or not we're going to continue to waste money and then 
promote the need for rationing because of it.  Now, the institute of medicine reports, 
for instance, that we spend $75 billion a year because of healthcare fraud.  190 billion in 
excess administrative costs.  Inefficiently delivered services, $130 billion a year.  Now, 
my point is this:  It's easier to argue for balancing the budget on the backs of the old 
people who aren't voting and who don't have lobbyists and who don't have packs 
[spelled phonetically] than it is to try to rest the money away from the people who are -- 
who are perpetuating the fraud or rendering these services inefficiently.   
 
20:57:59 
 
And so I'm saying, let's not take the path of least resistance.  Let's not take the lazy 
man's way out.  Let's do what we need to do to reform wasteful spending and not -- not 
force ourselves into a position where we think we have to ration healthcare at the 
expense of the elderly. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 -

Arthur Kellermann:   
You just lost me there, Ken, because I thought you said earlier that what we wanted to 
do was to get government out of the business and let doctors do whatever the heck 
they want.  But you just told us we were wasting $750 billion, so I -- 
 
Ken Connor: 
When healthcare providers perpetrate fraud, government has a legitimate interest in 
stopping that fraud.  That's a perfectly appropriate role for government. 
 
Peter Singer:   
But it isn't just fraud.  I mean, the problem is that the financial incentives in the market 
system, that the opposition are defending all the way, provide incentives to do more. 
 Here is an example.  The national rate of cesarean sections is 34 percent of births.  
 
20:58:59 
 
There's an outfit called Intermountain in Utah healthcare that has a cesarean rate of 20 
percent.  It saved $50 million by doing fewer cesarean sections.  But it cost it money.  It 
lost money by doing fewer cesarean sections, by saving the system $50 million it 
suffered a financial hit itself because the financial incentives are to do more and you get 
paid more, and you can pay -- you can build up your financial base, expand, stop, et 
cetera.  So this is the problem with allowing this to be done through the free market. 
 We need something that puts a lid on not just fraud but also the incentives to do more 
medical treatments. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
[applause] 
 
Female Speaker:   
Thank you.  I'm Peggy Lester.   
 
20:59:59 
 
And I've been a nurse for 30 years in an emergency room here in town.  My question for 
everyone on the panel is if -- you know, the profit issue of all of this is what seems to me 
is what the issue is.  And so eventually I see it that insurance companies, if we privatize 
everything, insurance companies will come to a point where they're not making a profit, 
and that they will then begin to ration care, which they actually already do.  So I would 
like you to speak to, I think, any time we have a health care system that depends that 
everybody's going to make a profit off of it, we really don't do the best thing for 
everybody involved.  So if you could just comment on that.

John Donvan 
Do you mind if I tweak your question slightly? 
 
Female Speaker:   
Go ahead. 
 
John Donvan 
I don't think very much, but to ask Sally Pipes just, to your point, that ultimately, if you 
do go to an all private system, that private companies would have the same -- exactly 
the same motives to ration as anybody else, and that there would be rationing under 
the program that you're talking about. 
 
21:01:08 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Well, first of all, I'd like to say that -- 
 
John Donvan 
So are you good with that? 
 
Female Speaker:   
Yes. 
 
John Donvan 
Okay. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Under the Affordable Care Act, I believe with the essential benefit plan that will be part 
of these exchanges, where government is going to determine what is a package, what is 
in the mandate, what insurance companies are going to be able to charge, I believe that 
a number of insurance companies are going to get out of the insurance market because 
it's not profitable for them to stay in the market.  And so we've already seen Principal 
Financial in Indiana dropped all health insurance, 800,000 people lost their coverage, 
and -- 
 
Female Speaker:   
But -- 
 
Sally Pipes:   
No, just a minute Aetna and several other -- 
 
John Donvan:   
I've seen that on television recently. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

[laughter] 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Oh, yeah.  Aetna and some other companies have already done that.   
 
21:01:58 
 
I know that United Health is not writing individual policies in California because it's just 
too expensive, too much regulation.  So, you know, I believe that Medicare should be 
there for those seniors who really need it.  Medicaid should be there for those people 
who are at 133 percent below the poverty level.  I think that Medicaid should be 
[unintelligible] granted to the states so that they can make these decisions.  I'm not 
saying the whole system should be private, but I'm saying if we can move away from 
employer based coverage to an individual system -- 
 
John Donvan 
Okay, but -- all right, but -- I have to interrupt you because I do have an internal sense of 
the question not being answered. 
 
 [laughter] 
 
John Donvan 
And the question was, "Won't insurance companies -- if you went to a private system, 
won't insurance companies end up with exactly the same need to conserve resources 
and we heard this woman saying for the sake of making profit, but whatever the reason 
is, won't they have to conserve resources and end up rationing anyway? 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Well, there's always going to be rationing, but the question is "Who do you want to be 
doing the rationing?" 
 
[booing] 
 
Do you want government to be making decisions about your care, or do you want an 
insurance company which doesn't -- isn't full of fraud and abuse --  
 
21:03:04 
 
[booing] 
 
As Obama said "Medicare and Medicaid, $500 billion in fraud and abuse."  If those 
programs are so great, why are they the programs that have all the fraud and abuse in 
them?

Arthur Kellermann:   
Okay, John -- 
 
John Donvan 
Oh, okay, Art, yes, sir. 
 
Ken Connor:   
-- may I weigh in on that?  I come back to the premise that I outlined earlier.  And that is 
that we should be able to make consumer driven decisions, informed by the medical 
community, mediated by markets.  Now, the difference between markets and the 
government is that within markets you have a choice.  And so if you don't like the way 
the insurance company is rationing your care or the circumstances that it requires for 
you to participate in, then you have alternatives.  When you're in a one size fits all 
government program, you have no alternatives.  You have lost your liberty in that 
regard. 
 
John Donvan 
All right.   I don't feel like there is a need from a response from this side because the 
question was posed to this side, so I'm going to go on to another question.  Sir. 
 
21:04:02 
 
Male Speaker:   
This is a question about rationing, correct, and whether or not ethically we at the 
government have the right to ration, is that -- 
 
John Donvan 
Yeah, I would say so. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Male Speaker:   
So last year my father -- sorry -- my brother-in-law's father was in a car accident, had his 
spine severed, and was in the hospital for six months, ICU, back and forth.  He actually -- 
I think he had bills for about $1.5 million.  So with that, he was 72.  I want to put out a 
hypothetical story.  You have three gentlemen, 72 years old.  One is unemployed and 
always has been unemployed, always been on government care.  One of them is a -- 
let's say, somebody who's in jail.  And then a third person is someone who has actually 
been in the system paying taxes and everything else.  They get in a car accident, same 
thing happens.  Do all three deserve, from government care, the same result? 
 
21:05:05 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan 
Which side would you like to hear answer that question? 
 
Male Speaker:   
Over here. 
 
John Donvan 
Did you follow it?  If you didn't follow it, I want to say, "Neither did I." 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Okay, good.  Well, I didn't.  I didn't. 
 
John Donvan 
It was a lot for me to follow.  Can you simplify -- you know, turn it into a principle rather 
than a scenario? 
 
Male Speaker:   
Okay. 
 
John Donvan 
Thanks. 
 
Male Speaker:   
Three people -- 
 
John Donvan 
No, no, no, no. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Male Speaker:   
Does everybody, regardless of their status and stature in life, deserve exactly the same 
care when the government is what is going to pay for that care? 
 
John Donvan 
What a great question. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Ken Connor. 
 
Ken Connor: 
Well, in America, we've historically said that we're entitled to equal protection under 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

the law.  And so the government, arguably, has an obligation to treat everyone the 
same.  Now, in the marketplace, it doesn't always work that way.   
 
21:05:59 
 
We talk about equal opportunity, not equal outcomes.  And so that's what I like about 
the marketplace, is that decisions can be made in the marketplace.  Look, the notion 
that government is more qualified to make decision and to allocate resources than 
markets, I think, is a foolish notion.  The history of the world suggests otherwise.  The 
Soviet Union imploded on itself because its central managers were not efficient, but in 
the final analysis, I think we need to understand that the Constitution is a hedge against 
government.  It's not a hedge against individuals.  It's not a hedge against the markets. 
 Bu the Constitution limits the powers of government.  So if government is going to 
assume certain responsibilities, it's bound by the chains of the Constitution, and I think 
we want it that way. 
 
21:06:56 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Can I make a quick point? 
 
John Donvan 
There's another question.  Your question was, "Does everybody deserve the same level 
of care, regardless of who they are?"  And are you talking about extraordinary measures 
at the end-of-life care, which may need to be rationed because of scarcity of resources? 
 
Male Speaker:   
That's what this debate's about. 
 
John Donvan 
Yeah.  All right.  So your question -- but I think Sally Pipes said in her opening statement, 
each of us should have the right to live as long as we can. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Right.  And these people are 72, you said, or 71.  They're obviously on Medicare, 
because they're seniors.  And I think I'd like to ask Art, when someone turns up at an 
emergency room, they're on Medicare, do you ask, "Are you an ex-prisoner, or are you 
unemployed?"  I think there's a responsibility in the emergency room to treat these 
people.  And most doctors I know who are ER doctors have no idea whether the person 
is wealthy or poor or whatever.  So I think that under Medicare they should be treated 
by Art or whomever, in the equal way.

Male Speaker:   
No, but they were in the hospital for six months. 
 
John Donvan 
All right. 
 
Male Speaker:   
So, over the course of six months. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Well, that's a new -- you've added something  new to your scenario. 
 
John Donvan 
I'm going to move on, and not as a sign of disrespect, but just as a sign of the clock 
running.  Thank you.  Thanks for understanding.  I want to get a couple more questions. 
 Sir, right in the middle? 
 
21:08:07 
 
Male Speaker:   
My name is Ganesh Ramani [spelled phonetically]. 
 
John Donvan 
Can you -- the mic wasn't on; sorry. 
 
Male Speaker:   
My name is Ganesh Ramani.  My question is really for both parties, but I think more so 
for the side against the motion, because the side for the motion, I think, has more or 
less answered the question.  But the question is, is there a scenario or situation under 
which you would consider rationing end-of-life care? 
 
Ken Connor: 
Well, look, I think we're all in agreement that rationing is a de facto matter.  Rationing 
occurs.  The question is, who should ration?  And is government in a better position 
than others to ration? 
 
John Donvan 
But you've made that before, but, so, to his specific question, the answer is yes, there 
are situations -- 
 
Ken Connor: 
The answer is yes, and I favor rationing through markets and individuals rather than 
through government.

21:09:07 
 
John Donvan 
Okay.  Does the other side want to respond to that .  Okay.  Ma'am?  I'm sorry.  I'm 
going to take two more questions, then, if it's a serious question.  Just let the gentleman 
go first because that -- because that's who has the microphone.  And then we'll -- 
 
Male Speaker:   
Thank you. 
 
John Donvan 
Yes. 
 
Male Speaker:   
So for scarce resources, I view that there's kind of two types:  One is hospitals and 
doctors, and the other is government capital and government money to spend.  So I 
view them as kind of differently when I think of rationing end-of-life care.  And so I'm 
kind of -- first in terms of from this side, I believe I kind of heard that you're in favor of 
rationing, you know, government spending, while not rationing hospitals and doctors for 
those who want to pay for it.  I'm kind of -- so first I want to know, is that kind of 
correct?   
 
21:10:00 
 
And then also for this side, do you view that, why shouldn't somebody be responsible to 
save up their money or pay for private insurance so that they can pay for that end-of-life 
care while the government can ration the government spending but not ration the 
doctors and the hospitals? 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
I want to take your question as an opportunity to bring up another key point which we 
spent a lot of time tonight talking about economics, and we spent a little time talking 
about the uninsured and the underinsured.  But there's another group that really suffers 
under the current system.  And those are the folks who are lining the hallways and in 
trauma centers and ERs waiting for the ICU bed that they can't get into and are there for 
two or three days.  The ambulances are diverted from a trauma center to a non trauma 
center because all the beds are full.  We are not a country of unlimited money or of 
unlimited critical care capacity.   
 
21:10:58 
 
And so my perspective, and I think my colleague's perspective, is given that we live in a 
finite world, we want to do the most good for the most people possible.  And that 
should be our fundamental mission.  You can call that rationing, you can call it rational

use of resources.  But every life has worth.  And the fact that somebody got there first 
shouldn't be ultimately the prevailing decision.  We've got to maximize the benefit and 
the value and the system to society -- 
 
John Donvan 
What's the system then, Art?  Then what's the system that -- 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
The system is, again, you have to make decisions.  You work with families.  You have to 
figure out where -- 
 
John Donvan 
But if it's -- does Medicare get to set up a panel to say we're going to provide this 
particular procedure or not because it's evidence-based medicine suggests it's not cost 
effective.  Does Medicare get to say we're not going to do that? 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
I think Medicare gets to say we're not going to pay for it. 
 
John Donvan 
That's what I mean. 
 
Arthur Kellermann:   
Yeah.  I think if you say you're not going to pay for it, people will go, "Ah, never mind."  I 
mean, we know that.  The RAND Grant has done work for 40 years that showed that if 
people have to put their money on the table, they tend to make more careful decisions. 
 And that's just human nature. 
 
21:12:09 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan 
Do you want to respond to that, Ken or Sally? 
 
Ken Connor: 
I would, yes.  I mean, I -- 
 
John Donvan 
Ken Connor. 
 
Ken Connor: 
You've made a very good point that I think is a very important point, and that is that 
when we don't have skin in the game, we're less likely to be good stewards of the

resources available to us.  And so for instance I think one way that we can promote 
having skin in the game in the responsible consumption of medical resources is to allow 
young people, for instance, to have health savings accounts with high deductible 
insurance policies.  And they've got skin in the game.  Let the government subsidize or 
provide tax breaks to individuals who purchase health insurance, not just to businesses.  
 
21:12:59 
 
The way the current system is set up is that we tend to over consume the resources 
because we don't have any skin in the game.  The employer is paying the bill.  The 
government subsidizes the employer, and there's no skin off our nose.  And so if we 
want to promote good stewardship, good stewardship, then I think we ought to -- ought 
to cause people to have skin in the game.  And that would mean that they have a stake 
in their own healthcare decisions.  If they do, they're less likely to over consume 
resources than they otherwise would be. 
 
Sally Pipes:   
And that's a very good point:  Consumer-driven healthcare, health savings accounts 
have shown that the cost of care is down because people do have skin in the game.  And 
in fact, Art, Rand Corporation came out with a study on HSAs for small businesses 
showing that that is a way to reduce costs for small business employers.  And I think 
that it was -- they were really good results about 13 1/2 million people in this country 
have HSAs combined with a high deductible plan because if you have employer based 
coverage it is what Ken said, first dollar coverage.   
 
21:14:02 
 
People have no idea what the doctor visit costs, they go more often.  Consumer-driven 
healthcare is a terrific solution. 
 
John Donvan 
Okay.  Ma'am, I owe you an apology.  If this were the Oscars, the music would be 
playing.  I -- I have to -- I have to stop because this concludes -- because this concludes 
round 2 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.

John Donvan 
And if you'll remember, before the arguments began, we asked all of you to vote on this 
motion.  We're going to ask you again after you hear the closing remarks.  This is their 
last chance to try to ease your mind.  On to round three, closing statements.  They are 
two minutes each.  Our motion is this:  Ration end-of-life care.  And here to summarize

her position against this motion, Sally Pipes, president and chief executive officer of the 
Pacific Research Institute. 
 
[applause] 
 
21:14:56 
 
Sally Pipes:   
Thank you, John.  And you know by now I am against the proposition that end-of-life 
care should be rationed.  The Medicare trustees have projected that the program 
Medicare will be bankrupt by 2024 at a cost of $1 trillion, almost double the costs today. 
 One of the ways to reduce the costs of our Medicare programs is to deny end-of-life 
care.  I believe it's morally wrong, but the position is supported by my opponent.  There 
are 50 million seniors in this country today on Medicare.  And that number is going to 
expand exponentially as the baby boomers retire.  And I am one of the baby boomers. 
 Doctors are already feeling the financial squeeze.  They are reimbursed by government 
at a rate 20 percent below what they get for treating private patients.  It is no wonder 
that 52 percent of doctors surveyed say they're limiting the access of Medicare patients 
to their practices.  Unless reformed, this could result actually in bureaucrats setting an 
age limit for one's life.  In order to save Medicare for those who truly need it, changes 
are necessary, including premium support, mean testing and raising the eligibility age 
from 65.   
 
21:16:08 
 
Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi who represents my district, “if the changes 
suggested by Romney and Ryan are implemented, seniors will die in the streets.”  Well, I 
believe if we don't make these changes, based on the Medicare cuts seniors will die in 
the streets.  They won't be able to get doctors or the care they need.  Don Berwick when 
he was administrator at CMMS said, "It's not a question of whether we're rationing care 
or not.  Will we ration it with our eyes open?"  We do not want a NICE system in this 
country.  It's not the American way where a government body determines what is cost 
effective rather than medically effective.  America needs a healthcare system where 
doctors and patients make decisions about the best kind of care that is needed when 
their loved ones approach the end of their lives.  Morally and ethically, this is the only 
way to proceed.  I urge you to vote against rationing the end-of-life care.  Thank you 
very much for listening. 
 
21:17:05 
 
John Donvan 
Thank you, Sally Pipes.

John Donvan 
And now in support of the motion, Peter Singer.  He is professor of bioethics in the 
University Center for Human Values at Princeton University. 
 
Peter Singer:   
We've actually reached a surprising amount of agreement in this debate because both 
sides agree that rationing occurs.  Sally said there's always going to be rationing.  Ken 
said we are all in agreement that rationing occurs.  The question is he went on to say, is 
who should ration?  He says he favors rationing through markets rather than 
government.  But you should read that article that he wrote that I mentioned before on 
the website about the problems of the elderly because his approach from that article, 
all-profits nursing homes have on average 32 percent fewer nurses and 47 percent 
higher deficiencies than their nonprofit counterparts.   
 
21:18:00 
 
This increased emphasis on profits has led to a distressing rise in neglected end of use 
seniors.  So I have to ask, why does Ken have such confidence in the market, solving the 
problem of the allocation of medical resources, when he is broadly, I believe, critical of 
what all-profits nursing homes do to abuse seniors.  We think that there has to be a 
better way than allowing profit maximization to determine how we are cared for.   
 
Let me just conclude by referring to the case that Sally began with, the sad case of her 
mother, and say that although that is a tragic case, obviously we cannot generalize from 
a sample of one.  I spent most of my life living under single-payer systems, either in 
Australia or in the United Kingdom.   
 
21:18:58 
 
I or rather my wife, had two of our children in the United Kingdom and one of them in 
Australia.  I think that the quality of care that we have received in Australia has been 
outstanding.  I've obviously had medical care in this country.  I don't think that it's better 
than it is in Australia.  And I don't think that it's even more a respectful of individual 
choice because Australians can insure themselves in addition to Medicare. 
 
John Donvan 
Peter Singer your time is up. 
 
Peter Singer:   
Thank you very much.

And here to summarize his position against the motion, Ken Connor.  He is founder and 
chairman of the Center for a Just Society. 
 
Ken Connor: 
One of our founding fathers said, "If men were angels then we wouldn’t need 
government."  Men are not angels and we do.  Markets are not perfect.  And they do 
need regulation.  The question is "Where do we wind up striking the balance?"  And I 
can tell you to Peter’s point that care in our nursing homes in America is America's dirty 
secret.   
 
21:20:03 
 
And it's in part because a -- real estate investors pose as health care providers.  And the 
government doesn't adequately regulate them, plain and simple.  And we have a 
absolute scourge of preventable bedsores, and avoidable malnutrition, and dehydration, 
falls, and avoidable infections.  But let me say this, I think it's important to understand 
that rationing is not required in order for the health care system to remain solvent.  That 
assumes the fallacy of only one alternative, that either we ration or we're going to go 
broke.  That's not true.  And that's why I brought up the point earlier in the debate, 
which Dr. Kellermann didn't seem to understand, that there are lots of places from 
which we can effect savings.  But it's work to effect these savings.   
 
21:21:00 
 
It's hard work to wrest resources from the hands of the special interests.  We should not 
ration.  We should not balance the budget on the back of the sick and the dying.  We 
can provide good health care for all people through and including the end of life.  We 
need to ask good questions.  We need to ask, "Are the procedures necessary?  Are they 
clinically indicated?  Is the cost reasonable?"  What we need is a rational approach to 
end-of-life health care, not the rationing of end-of-life health care.  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan 
Thank you, Ken Connor. 
 
[applause] 
 
And, finally, in support of the motion, Arthur Kellermann.  He is the Paul O'Neill Alcoa 
chair in Policy Analysis at the Rand Corporation.

Arthur Kellermann:   
Most Western democracies have health care systems that provide you with all the care 
you need, whether or not you can afford it.   
 
21:22:00 
 
Our health care system has evolved to provide you with all the health care you can 
afford, whether or not you need it. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Modern American medicine is a $2.8 trillion a year industry, and it is rapidly outgrowing 
our economy's capacity to support it.  More high tech care is not necessarily better care. 
 Sometimes the basics, pain control, bedside attention, love, matter a lot more than the 
most sophisticated $100,000 medicines there are.  That's why, when terminally ill 
patients came into my ER, I did not immediately incubate, immediately start multiple 
IVs, immediately do anything I didn't absolutely have to do.  I stabilized the patient the 
best I could, I assessed the situation, and I talked to the patient.  If they were able to 
communicate or not, I would bring the proxy -- the son, the daughter of, a brother, the 
spouse to the bedside.   
 
21:23:07 
 
Let me tell you what happened one night as an example.  I brought a daughter who had 
cared for her mother for 10 years to the bedside, and I said, "Your mom has severe 
pneumonia.  She's septic.  This is the third time she's been in the hospital in the last two 
months.  We can do everything we know to do, and she will almost certainly die, but she 
might pull through.  And the best we can hope for is she'll be the way she was a week 
ago when she didn't recognize you and was in the nursing home.  So my question to you 
is not 'What do you want us to do?'  I know what you want us to do.  You want us to 
make your mother the way she used to be.  I can't do that.  So I want to ask you, 'What 
would your mother want if she came back now and stood next to you?'"  And she said, 
"Mama would say, 'It's time.'"  As you vote tonight, I ask you to consider what kind of 
doctor do you want to take care of your mother, and what kind of doctor will you want 
to take care of you, and that should guide your vote.

We're going to have the second vote now.  So if you go to the keypads in your seat. 
 After hearing everything, we want to know where you stand, whether you have been 
persuaded to one side or the other.  If you agree with the motion, "Ration end-of-life 
care," the side argued by this team, push number one.  If you disagree with the motion, 
with this team, push number two.  And if you are or became undecided, push number 
three.  And you can ignore all of the other keys.  And they will lock in pretty quickly, 
actually.  We'll have the vote probably in about a minute and 45 seconds. 
 
21:24:52 
 
And so, while we're waiting, a few things that I want to say.  First of all, ma'am, if we're 
lucky enough to be invited back next year, you find me at the beginning of the debate.  I 
owe you the first question.  Okay?  All right.  And everybody else who stood up and 
asked questions, including the ones that we didn't get to use, it takes a lot of guts to 
stand up, and a lot of the questions were great, actually.  I want to thank all of you for 
doing that. 
 
[applause] 
 
I also want to thank, despite what I would professionally consider a little bit of 
meandering in the middle, I think we got into some very important places in this debate 
where the clash was head-on.  We could see the values represented by both of these 
sides, because he doesn't actually have to think in real time.  That's a very impressive 
thing to see happen.  It's difficult to do.  I want to thank this panel for what they've 
brought here to this stage. 
 
[applause] 
 
It's really been a pleasure to be part of Chicago Ideas Week and to be in the city at all. 
 You actually are a very, very lively audience, and you're going to sound great on the 
radio.   
 
21:26:02 
 
Afterwards, after the debate, we would be delighted, of course, to have you tweet 
about the debate.  Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US, and the hashtag is the same, #IQ2US. 
 
I want to thank the CIW team, in particular I want to name some people.  Brad Keywell, 
Carrie Kennedy, and Jessica Malkin who, again, was very instrumental in getting us on 
this stage. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our next debate is Wednesday, October 24th.  It will be held in New York City.  And the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 57 -

motion in this date is, "The rich are taxed enough."  In support of the motion, we have 
Glen Hubbard, is currently dean of the Columbia Business School.  He is also an 
economic advisor to presidential candidate Mitt Romney.  His partner is Art Laffer, who 
is known as the father of supply side economics, the famous Laffer curve is his curve. 
 He was a member of President Reagan's economic policy advisory board.   
 
21:27:05 
 
He's debated with us before, and he's actually very -- not only smart, he's very witty.  He 
keeps everybody laughing.  Against this motion, "The rich are taxed enough," we have 
Robert Reich, who is former secretary of labor in the Clinton Administration and 
professor at the University of California in Berkeley, and Mark Zandi, who is one of the 
most widely followed economic forecasters and the chief economist of Moody's 
Analytics. 
 
So, all right.  The results are being walked up.  So, remember, we had you vote -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
This never happens in New York.  That was very generous.  Our motion is, "Ration end-
of-life care."  We now have the results in on your votes.  Remember, we had you vote 
before you heard the argument and once again after hearing the arguments, and the 
team who has changed your numbers the most, who has moved you to their side by the 
largest percentage, will be declared our winners.   
 
21:28:06 
 
So here is how it breaks out.  Before the debate, 43 percent were for the motion, 22 
percent against, and 35 percent undecided.  After the debate, 38 percent are for the 
motion -- I'm sorry.  After the debate, 81 percent are for the motion, up 38 percent; 12 
percent are against it, down 10 percent; 7 percent are undecided.   
 
[applause] 
 
The side arguing for the motion carries the debate. Our congratulations to them.  Thank 
you from, me, John Donvan, in Chicago, and Intelligence Squared U.S.
