EDWARD LUCAS 

I’m now going to ask, um, Robert Rosenkranz, the chairman of 

the Rosenkranz Foundation which is the sponsor of Intelligence 

Squared here in the United States, who’s going to frame tonight’s 

debate.  Bob.   

[APPLAUSE]   

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Thank you, Edward, and, uh, welcome, Dana Wolfe and I, uh, are 

very pleased to, uh, to extend a warm welcome to this evening’s 

debate, “Russia is Becoming Our Enemy Again.”  Now this is not 

a debate about Russia’s domestic arrangements, and whether we 

approve of them.   Uh, clearly, President Putin has presided over 

a massive transfer of wealth and influence to a new Russian elite 

of former KGB operatives.  He’s an autocrat who wants to keep 

his power.   Russia is pursuing a far more assertive foreign 

policy, disrupting oil supply when displeased by its neighbors, 

threatening a new arms race, attacking the US as, quote, “the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 2. 

 

 

 

main violator of freedoms and human rights.”   On the back of 

$90 oil, the Russian economy is growing rapidly.  The bear is 

well-fed and snarling.  And by all accounts, the Russian public 

heartily approves.  The question tonight though is whether a new 

Cold War is emerging.  The most troublesome evidence is 

Russia’s belligerence, even when its interests and ours seem to 

be aligned.  It’s hard to imagine that Russia wants a nuclear Iran, 

or a radical Islamic insurgency.  So what do they hope to gain by 

undermining US pressure on Iran?  It’s also, uh, hard to see the 

advantage of discouraging foreign capital, technology and 

management skill.  Or how it serves Russian interests to be 

perceived as an unreliable long-term supplier of energy.  On the 

other hand, it’s easy to understand why Russia might be 

smarting from a loss of empire, and international respect.  Why it 

might be wary about an American missile defense shield placed 

in its own back yard.  It’s easy to see why the former oligarchs 

were viewed as having gained their wealth illegitimately.  And it’s 

understandable why Russia favors economic sanctions to exert 

pressures in its neighborhood, particularly when sanctions are 

favored policy tool of ours.   So it’s easy to see how Putin’s new 

assertiveness enhances his domestic popularity and power.  Is 

Russia becoming our enemy again, or is it reacting in an 

understandable way to domestic political considerations, or 

perhaps to our own mistakes.   Well, we have an outstanding

panel to help us decide, and a very able moderator in Edward 

Lucas—a veteran observer of the collapse of the Soviet Union, a 

long-time Moscow bureau chief for The Economist, fluent in five 

regional languages, and the auth—author of the forthcoming 

book, The New Cold War, so maybe he’s not, uh, quite so neutral 

as he appears.  [LAUGHTER]  Edward, the evening is yours.   

EDWARD LUCAS 

Well, thanks very much indeed, Bob, for your, um, gracious 

introduction.  [APPLAUSE]  Now for those of you who haven’t 

been at one of these de—de—debates before let me just give you a 

brief rundown of the, um, of—of the evening.  Um, the members 

of the teams on both sides are going to give brief eight-minute 

introductions to their arguments, an eight minutes which will be 

ruthlessly enforced from the chair.   And when those are complete 

I’m going to have a bit of discussion among the panel, and then 

open up to questions and points from the audience, and at the 

end of that we will have two-minute summations from each 

member of the panel, and then a vote.  And you’ll vote with these 

keypads, and you’re gonna get a chance to practice, ‘cause we’re 

gonna have a vote at the beginning, and a vote at the end.   

Because as someone who works at The Economist I know that 

statistics are much better if you can measure them over time.  

And this will show how opinion has shifted in the course of the 

debate.  So we’re gonna—in the course of the debate.   So we’re 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 4. 

 

 

 

gonna start off with the pre-debate vote, which shows your 

opinions as they were before you heard the arguments.  So please 

pick up the keypad which in almost all cases will be on the 

armrest on your left.  But, if you’re on the right-hand…aisle, 

you’ll have to pick up—you don’t have a left, you have—there’ll be 

two keypads on your armrest and you’ll pick up one of them.   

And so tonight’s resolution is “Russia is Becoming Our Enemy 

Again.”  And when I tell you to, I’d like you to press 1, if you’re for 

the motion, 2 if you’re against, 3 if you’re undecided, and on no 

account press buttons 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, “Go O.J.” or “question 

mark,” because then something—something bad will happen.  

[LAUGHTER]   So you may begin voting now, you don’t need to 

talk while you’re voting, we just—it’ll just take a couple of 

seconds, so please, 1 for “for,” 2 for “against,” and 3 for 

“undecided,” the panel is not allowed to vote, and I’m not going 

to.  So, let’s see.  [PAUSE]   Now, if you’ve all voted, you won’t see 

the result now, uh, but you will see it in the course of the 

evening, and it’ll be very interesting.  And I’m now going to 

introduce—introduce the panel, although you may have very 

strong personal views for or against, please refrain from either 

giving applause or even unmannerly boos, until all six have been 

introduced.   So for the motion, uh, Claudia Rosett, staff 

journalist-in-residence at the Foundation for Defense of 

Democracies; Bret Stephens, foreign affairs columnist and

member of the Editorial Board of The Wall Street Journal, and J. 

Michael Waller who’s the Annenberg Chair in International 

Communication at the Institute for World Politics, and also Vice 

President for Information Operations at the Center for Security 

Policy.  Don’t clap.  [LAUGHTER]   Against the motion, the Senior 

Fellow of the World Policy Institute and Professor of International 

Affairs at the New School here in New York, Nina—Nina 

Khrushcheva; Robert Legvold, who’s the Marshall D. Schulman 

Professor of Political Science at Columbia University; and finally 

Mark Medish, who’s the Vice President for Studies of Russia, 

China and Eurasia at the Carnegie Endowment for International 

Peace.  Welcome.  [APPLAUSE]  So, Claudia Rosett, you have 

eight minutes, starting now.   

CLAUDIA ROSETT 

Thank you and good evening, um…  [PAUSE]  For the radio 

audience I’ve just placed a teapot and a teacup on the lectern.  

It’s a pleasure to be here this evening, thank you to our host, the 

Rosenkranz Foundation, to NPR.  Thank you also, to—thank all 

of you for coming and thank you to the opposing team, for what I 

know will be a well-articulated argument for something we all 

wish were true.   Unfortunately it is not.  I am here to argue for 

the motion that Russia is becoming our enemy again.  I’d like to 

begin with a few definitions.  Russia is an enormous polity 

encompassing more than 140 million people, 11 time zones and a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 6. 

 

 

 

multitude of views.   I’m sure that many people in this room are 

personally acquainted with Russians who are by no means our 

enemies.  Uh, but inside Russia, their views count for less and 

less.  And in speaking of Russia, we must speak increas—of the 

increasingly authoritarian state—  In speaking of Russia in this 

debate tonight, the increasingly authoritarian Russian state of 

President Putin, of the security apparatus, and the chief and 

increasingly centralized and authoritarian centers of power.  Um, 

another definition I’d like to just get into quickly that’s important 

is “enemy.”  The American Heritage Dictionary, which seems 

appropriate tonight, defines “enemy” as, quote, “one who 

manifests malice or hostility toward or opposes the purposes or 

interests—interests of another.  A foe; an opponent.”   Finally, no 

one is here tonight that Ru—to argue that Russia is right now our 

enemy.  The motion up for debate is that Russia is becoming our 

enemy again.  It is that direction, that becoming, that trajectory, 

which we are here to debate.  For two benchmarks, I would like 

to share with a memory of a dinner in Moscow more than a 

decade ago.  It was with someone who has experienced, then and 

since, firsthand, Russia’s trajectory not at a distance but has 

been living it.  Uh, he was then optimistic, it was a dinner with a 

number of journalists and despite our worries, he assured us 

that all would be well, that Russia was heading in a good 

direction, that Russians could get rich doing honest business.

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 7. 

 

 

 

His name was Garry Kasparov.  Today, Mr. Kasparov has been 

pouring forth articles and giving interviews in the West warning 

us that Russia is becoming, indeed has become, a criminal petro-

state.   The model he tells us is not the old czarist autocracy, but 

The Godfather, the Mafia.  He wants to run in the Presidential 

election next March, but what he recently told MSNBC is that 

we’re not—quote, “We’re not fighting to win elections, we’re 

fighting to have elections.”   Okay, that may be bad for Russia, 

but does it mean that Russia’s government is becoming America’s 

enemy.  Yes.  We live in an age when governments tend to export 

their creeds, methods, and technologies—uh, and techniques, 

excuse me.   And, um, I’d like to just invite you for a minute to 

imagine, engage in a little imaginary experiment, that you are a 

Russian democrat, a patriot, trying to warn the free world that 

Russia is becoming an increasingly dangerous police state.   Let’s 

say you’re investigating the murder of a journalist and you meet 

in a city, say London, with an emissary of the Kremlin.  You have 

every right to the question you wish to ask, tea is served.  Would 

you without a second thought these days, drink that tea?  

[LAUGHTER]   This is a picture of Alexander Litvinenko who 

drank it, he’s here on this deathbed, these are the effects of 

Polonium 210 on the human body.  This—the Kremlin denies 

anything to do with it.  Uh, this is a picture of Viktor 

Yushchenko, during his successful bid for the Presidency of the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 8. 

 

 

 

Ukraine, over the Kremlin’s objections, these are the effects of 

dioxin on the human face.   [00:12:20:09]  The Kremlin denies 

anything to do with it.  Uh, to get to the bottom of such stories, 

can we turn to the Russian media.  No, not likely.  They’ve been 

murdered, harassed, taken over, again the trajectory in the early 

‘90s, when that optimistic dinner with Garry Kasparov took place, 

Russia had a lively press, you could quarrel with what they 

wrote, but they could say what they wanted to, the shutdowns 

and takeovers since then, and I include a very partial list—  NTV, 

the independent TV station, ORT, all sort of coopted by 

government forces.  The newsweekly Itogi Savonia [PH], TV-6, 

Kommersant, the list goes on.  The broad narrative over this time 

is that there have been phases and steps forward and back, to 

this direction that the Russian government is taking.   But, the 

broad arc, is that in the early 1990s, everything was up for grabs, 

the rules, the property, the whole thing, it was being sorted out.  

At this point, the shake-out has largely taken place.  What do  we 

see.  The government has effectively reabsorbed the revenues 

coming from such oil and gas giants as Yukos and Gazprom.   

Uh, we’ve seen them murdering of journalists, we’ve see the 

targeting of businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who wanted to 

engage on Western terms with Western business.  We’ve seen the 

increasing control over the regions, we’ve seen the rising charade 

of elections with President Putin now suggesting he might want to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 9. 

 

 

 

stay on as Prime Minister.  Again the rise of the authoritarian 

state.   Again, does this make Russia our enemy.  Um…yes, 

that’s—and the reason why is, governments such as this need 

enemies to justify what they do, to deflect anger and frustrations, 

to show that they are important and necessary.  And in 

Russia’s—the Russ—Russia in the sense of those who now rule—   

In Russia’s quest to do that the real rival is the US.  And, 

following, sort of the initial and conditional cooperation we saw in 

a sort of sunny phase just after September 11th— even that was 

problematic—Russia’s government has become increasingly 

hostile and confrontational.   If I run out of time my colleagues 

are going to cover more for you, but, let’s give a few examples.  

Uh, Putin’s polarizing speech in February in Munich accusing the 

US of, quote, singling out the US, of forcing its will on the world, 

and accusing the US of undermining international security.  

Quote, “One state, the United States, has oversepped a— stepped 

its national borders in every way,” he said.  You can find a great 

many more examples of states, you can argue about US policy 

but, he was directing this at the US for the world to hear.  Um, 

according to a recent statement by the US Director of National 

Intelligence, Russia now spies on the US nearly as much as 

during the Cold War.   Uh, the difficulties raised for neighbor—

nearby states, uh, which are inclined to be friendliest to the US, 

including…lobbing a missile into Georgia, fiddling with gas

supplies to the Ukraine, waging cyberwar on Estonia, and, finally, 

Iran, where Russia has spent more than a decade over US 

protests transferring nuclear technology.   Uh, and at the UN in 

Security Council efforts to do something about this has been, one 

of the prime obstacles, watering down resolutions, objecting, 

signing only when—

CLAUDIA ROSETT 

—it may, may—it couldn’t really do much more.  Oil prices.  

Russia has every interest in keeping those high, roiling the 

Middle East, making trouble that is…in—inimical to US interests.  

Six years ago President Bush looked into President Putin’s eyes 

and thought he saw a friend of the United States of America.  If 

only.  What we have been learning since then as Russia charts its 

course, its direction of becoming, is that in America’s dealings 

with the Kremlin, it is wiser as with any antagonist, foe, 

opponent, enemy in the making, to watch your back.  Thank you 

very much.   

[APPLAUSE]   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Thank you very much indeed, um, Claudia Rosett, for the benefit 

of the radio audience I should say the teapot was blue.  Robert 

Legvold.

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

It’s a pleasure to be with you and a pleasure to be a part of this 

event.  I think everybody in this hall would agree that Russia 

today is not a US ally, not even a disaffected ally as so many of 

our traditional friends are.  But then to claim that Russia is, or 

soon will be an enemy, seems to us to be both wrong, and 

unhelpful, almost certainly even harmful.   It’s wrong because it 

misunderstands what Russia’s all about, and it misunderstands 

what motivates its foreign policy.  And it’s unhelpful, maybe even 

harmful as I’ve said, because it almost certainly runs the risk of 

bringing about the behavior and the stance on Russia’s part that 

we fear in the first place, and not the least, not the least, 

by…driving home or reinforcing the extraordinary excessive 

suspicion of the US that radiates across not merely the political 

leadership but the political spectrum in Russia, and the 

enormously warped misinterpretation of US, uh, foreign policy 

and what we are all about.   There’s no question, that Putin’s 

Russia, Putin himself has put Russia, in the forefront of the most 

vocal critics of US foreign policy, there’s no question that anti-

Americanism within Russia, is more intense and more 

widespread not only than it has been at any point in the 15 years 

of Russian independence but well back into the Soviet period.   

There’s no question, that the Russian leadership and  much of 

the political elite sees…NATO initiatives and US foreign policy 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 12. 

 

 

 

initiatives as a threat to their  national  security, and indicate 

that they mean to offset them.   There’s no question that what 

Russia’s doing on a number of issues of concern to us are 

contrary, is contrary to our preferences.  Uh, and there is no 

question as Claudia has well-demonstrated, that under Putin 

Russia has veered from the democratic path.   That makes Russia 

a challenge.  That doesn’t make Russia an enemy.  What is 

Russia about.  I think three things.  First of all a renewed voice.  

Russia once again wants a place at the table with the major 

powers.   Secondly, Russia wants respect for its national interests 

as it defines them, not the way in which we define them.  

Secondly—or third, Russia wants an end to the assigned role as 

either a pupil or as a junior partner.   As one of the Russians 

wrote not so long ago, “The pedagogical relationship is over,” and 

Russia wants an independent role in international politics, even a 

leadership role.  And we’re seeing it increasingly in the way in 

which they exert themselves as a mediator on major issues, 

among and between major powers.   And third, or second, what it 

wants beyond voice, is an enhanced power and influence within 

the post-Soviet space.  And this in two ways particularly, first of 

all, as a lead role in managing security within that sphere, that’s 

very different from acquiring real estate, and secondly 

aggrandizing itself economically within the post-Soviet space, and 

aggrandizing itself economically is very important to Putin at this 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 13. 

 

 

 

point.   None of this you’ll notice, suggests that Russia is easy or 

not a problem for us, I said challenge.  Doesn’t make it an enemy, 

and third it wants…it wants influence over the design of an 

evolving international order.  The first step from that is to blunt 

what they see as excesses in US foreign policy.   That’s a problem 

for us.  They’re not the only country in the world that wants to 

blunt the excesses in US foreign policy.  But they then go on to 

talk about collective major-power responsibility in international 

politics, and they want to extend the circle.   They mean to bring 

in China and India and probably beyond that.  So wherein then is 

the problem?  What makes Russia a challenge and not an enemy.  

I think it is the ambiguity and the shapelessness at the very base 

of Russian foreign policy today.   Because, the heart of Russia’s 

international posture today, is a unity of opposites.  Russia 

claims it has no enemy, it has no ally.  Everyone—no one is an 

enemy, no one is an ally, everyone is a partner, everyone is a 

competitor.   And that leads to a behavior, which is troublesome 

not only for us but I think for the future of Russia in its foreign 

policy, a policy of trying to have its cake and eat it as well.  And 

this and fur— furthermore is compounded by the absence of 

strategic vision, within Putin’s Russia, and on his part as leader.  

Uh, Russia foreign policy’s driven by impulses and di—and, and 

desires, but impulses are not a strategy.  And even less are they a 

strategic vision.   And without strategic vision Russia is not in a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 14. 

 

 

 

position to make durable, long-term strategic choices.  So then, 

what should be our response in these circumstances.  First of all, 

what not to do.  What not to do is premature containment, and 

jumping to that conclusion.  Not empty hectoring, not drawing 

red lines.  Not even tough love, particularly when we have so little 

direct leverage in order to pursue that kind of a policy.   And 

what to do?  A policy that would be deft, that would be coherent, 

that would be frank, and that would be firm, and that would 

follow, in my view, three guidelines.  First of all to try to engage in 

a constructive and an effective dialogue with Russia over all 

issues including the most fundamental ones that concern 

Claudia and her colleagues as, uh, even— uh, uh, that concerns 

us as much as it concerns Claudia and her colleagues, that is, 

the basic values question and where things are going within 

Russia.  But not posturing.  And in order to get to a dialogue with 

Russia we have a fundamental initial problem.   That is to 

persuade not merely Putin and people around him but a vaude 

[sic]—broad part of the political spectrum, that our stake in this 

is not an ulterior motive, that it’s genuine, and that it is direct.  

Secondly, I think that… uh, we want to as much as possible 

focus on the overlap in our core interests, and they’re very 

considerable, while mitigating the increasingly tension-field 

[sic]—uh, tension-filled differences over tactics.   The core 

interests are, the struggle against global terrorism.  Islamic 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 15. 

 

 

 

extremism.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  

And the issue that we forget about these days, that is regulating, 

producing stability among the nuclear haves, not merely dealing 

with the nuclear have-nots.   This is now a multipolar nuclear 

world.  And we need to manage it in a way that we’ve neglected 

for any number of years, and finally, in a still more positive note, 

to, uh, promote the progressive and dynamic development of the 

post-Soviet economies, not just Russia.   The entire region, those 

are our common core interests, but we really do disagree often on 

how we go about a number of these cases, take the one that’s 

very much in the forefront of our mind these days, Iran.  I would 

not for a moment—   

EDWARD LUCAS 

One minute—   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

—deny that Russia and Putin and people around him, special 

interests around him have very self-regarding, selfish interests 

when it comes to developing their relationship with Iran.   But at 

heart the problem is a different one.  We agree, both Russia and 

the United States that we do not want a nuclear Iran.  But, at the 

tactical level we disagree about first of all, what kind of a time-

frame we’re operating in, how much time we have or not.   And 

then secondly how we put carrots and sticks together.  And the 

degree to which we privilege the sticks and privilege them early, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 16. 

 

 

 

that’s the kind of thing that we need to do if the core interest 

coordinate—if the core interest, is as I’ve said, to deny a nuclear 

Iran.   Uh…the…the third guideline would be that we coordinate 

our assessment and our approach to Russia among the major 

countries of the West, Europe and Japan, while at the same time 

in our policy toward China and India, that we deny Russia the 

opportunity of using China and Indian against us—   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Robert Legvold, your time is up, I’m afraid.   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

Thank you.  I’m finished.   

[APPLAUSE]   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Now just before Bret Stephens, um, continues the debate for the 

motion, um, if the remarks you’ve heard so far have already got 

you wanting to make points of your own the index cards are here 

held by the ushers, do attract their attention, get them to start 

jotting down questions you’d like to make to—or you’d like to ask 

and points you’d like to make, and they will then be passed to me 

and I will call you in due course, if I can.  Bret Stephens for the 

motion.    

BRET STEPHENS 

Well, like, uh, Claudia I wanna preface my comments by 

reminding, uh, all of you of what it is we are debating here.  Uh, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 17. 

 

 

 

Claudia, Michael and I are not on this stage to argue that Russia 

is an enemy of the United States.   And you as the audience are 

not here to vote on whether or not that proposition is true.  

Rather, we are here to make the case that Russia is becoming an 

enemy.  So what’s at issue here, is the trend, the direction, the 

question of where all—all this is going.   So let me devote my time 

to looking at in a very factual way, how events have unfolded in 

just the past year.  Let me remind you that we are on the eve of 

the anniversary of the poisoning of, um, Alexander Litvinenko.   

Let me remind you also that Alexander Litvinenko was a British 

subject.  He was murdered by a lethal dose of Pol—of Polonium 

210, which was a de facto case of nuclear homicide if not nuclear 

terrorism.  From his deathbed, Litvinenko personally accused 

Vladimir Putin of ordering the sa—the assassination.  Since then, 

Scotland Yard has pinned, uh, the murder on a Russian 

businessman, an ex- or if you will current FSB man, named 

Andre—Andrei Lugovoi.   [00:26:20:11]  In July, the British 

Foreign Secretary David Miliband, noted that, quote, “The 

Russian government has failed to register either how seriously we 

treat this case, or the seriousness of the issues involved.”  The 

Russian Foreign Ministry responded with a brush-off, that they 

could not understand why British would hazard its relationship 

with Russia, quote, “for the sake of one man.”   For the sake of 

one man, let me remind you that, liberal democracy is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 18. 

 

 

 

constructed for the sake of one man.  In a month’s time, Mr. 

Lugovoi, Litvinenko’s killer, is likely to be elected a member of the 

Russian parliament.   In December of 2006, the Kremlin pulled 

out— pulled the rug out from the largest foreign, uh,  investment 

to date in Russia, which was, uh, Shell’s 20—$20 billion oil and 

gas project on Sakhalin Island, using transparently phony 

regulatory excuses.  It happened again in June to British 

Petroleum.   [00:27:15:12]  The assault on foreign investment in 

Russia, was the natural extension of the illegal seizure of 

Russia’s privately held energy assets, particularly those of Yukos 

and its seek— and its CEO, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, whose prison 

term in a Siberian, uh, labor camp, has recently been extended.   

In January, Mr. Putin forced the Belarusian government to sign a 

new gas contract, or else have its gas supplies turned off in the 

dead of winter.  Now Belarus is not a friend of the United States, 

but Ukraine and Georgia are friends of the United States.   And in 

both cases Mr. Putin had previously used what I would call 

pipeline warfare to threaten his neighbors, to threaten and bully 

his neighbors at their coldest and most vulnerable moments.   

Nex—in the next month, in February, a man named Ivan 

Safronov, a reporter for the, uh, for the Kommersant newspaper, 

was—or I should say fell from a fourth-story window onto the 

street, where he died instantly.   The authorities ruled it a 

suicide, but most observers believe that Safronov, who had

repeatedly embarrassed the Russian military with his reporting, 

was executed, making him the 14th such journalist killed, 

murdered, during Mr. Putin’s reign.   The same month, a Russian 

court condemned nine members of the ethnic minorities’ rights 

group Froda, for having a quote-unquote, “unsanctioned tea” 

with two German students.  Quote, “We were told that under the 

new law on NGO’s, any meeting of two or more people, with the 

purpose of discussing publicly important issues, has to be 

sanctioned by the local administration three days in advance,” 

Froda’s director told London’s Daily Telegraph.   [00:29:03:25]  

The next month, in March, an American Russia analyst named 

Pol—named Paul Joyal, was shot outside his home in suburban 

Maryland, shortly after meeting a former KGB general.  Four days 

before that shooting, on “Dateline NBC,” Mr. Jo—Joyal had noted 

that, quote, “A message has been communicated to anyone who 

wants to speak out against the Kremlin.   If you do, no matter 

where you are, we will find you and we will silence you in the 

most horrible way possible,” end of quote.  The next month, in 

April, Mr. Putin indicated that he intended to withdraw Russia 

from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, one of the 

landmark agreements ending the Cold War.   He has since 

indicated, that he is prepared to withdraw Russia from the 1987 

Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed by Reagan and 

Gorbachov.  The next month, in May, um, ethnic Russians rioted

in the city of Tallinn, when the Estonian government decided to 

remove a World War II monument to their Soviet liberators.  

Estonia was subject to a conv—uh, to a concerted cyber-attack, 

and its ambassador in Moscow was attacked by youth protesters 

almost certainly belonging to a neo-fascist group known as Nashi, 

I should remind you that Estonia is a member of NATO and the 

European Union.   In June, Mr. Putin warned that if the US 

deployed just 10 ballistic missile interceptors in Poland, then 

Russia will, quote, “have to get new targets in Europe.  Which 

weapons will be used,” he said, “ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, 

or some completely new systems, that’s a technical matter.”   In 

July, Mr. Putin took a vacation.  In August…  [LAUGHTER]  Um, 

in August, Russia detained a mainstream business journalist for 

the Vedomosti paper, a paper that is, uh, uh, partly owned by, by 

Dow Jones, on suspicious of so-called extremist activity, via a law 

that defines the term “extremist” so broadly that it can be used to 

target ordinary political critics of the Kremlin.   Russia also 

resumed, and this is notable, a policy of sending its heavy 

bombers out on lower—long-range sorties, on more than several 

occasions, Norwegian, British, and finally American fighters have 

been forced to scramble into the air, in order to intercept these 

Russian bombers, the first time this has happened since the Cold 

War.   In September, Mr. Putin appointed an unknown 

apparatchik, Mr. Vic—Viktor Zubkov, as Prime Minister, and later

announced that he himself may become, uh, may—may—may 

become Prime Minister, um, in the next government, which is 

contrary to every prior promise he has made, that he would leave 

the political scene when his Presidential term expires.  This sets 

the scene for the youthful Mr. Putin to remain in power for a very 

long time indeed.

In October Mr. Putin became the first Russian leader to visit 

Tehran since Josef Stalin in 1943.  He said Iran’s purposes are 

entirely peaceful, Russia has stopped, um, cooperating with the 

rest of the Security Council on the UN, forcing the US to resort to 

the uni—to—to unilateral sanctions.  And finally I would like to 

make one point.  Just last week George W. Bush insisted in a 

speech, that Russia is not an enemy of the United States.  Now if 

that does not convince this audience [LAUGHTER] that our side 

is right, I don’t know what will.  Thank you very much.   

[APPLAUSE]

Thanks very much and if you’ve filled in some cards with

against the motion.

NINA KHRUSHCHEVA 

Thank you very much, thank you Rosenkranz Foundation, thank 

you the opposers of the motion, and thank you those who vote for 

it and thank you, Edward Lucas.  Uh, there are at least three 

reasons as to why Russia is not becoming an enemy, or at least 

shouldn’t become one.  One.  Today the world is no longer 

bipolar, in fact it’s not even multipolar, even—um, unipolar, even 

if some in the United States may still think it is.   That is America 

is no longer in a position to decide who to make or not to make 

an enemy, even though it certainly continues to be listened to in 

this regard.  But there are many more actors in play today, 

China, Middle East, Europe, whose international interests have 

to be considered.   There is no Cold War ideological divide in 

which one ideology wants to take over the other, and dominate 

the world.  Thus at present, there are no geopolitical conditions 

for the Cold War.  Two.  Despite the 11 time-zones, Russia is not 

a Soviet empire, to fight against.  It’s not an empire at all.  

Although true, under Vladimir Putin, it appears Russia still has 

its imperial ambitions as, uh, the, uh, those who supported the 

motion very ably demonstrated.  However the country today 

doesn’t have its former capabilities.  It could with varying 

successes create an illusion of those capabilities such as testing 

weapons, or, um…reinstating military exercises, which actually 

have been very much prone to accidents.   Although at times 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 23. 

 

 

 

Putin tries to flex his imperial muscles, old—at—old habits die 

hard, obviously.  Such as during the 2004 Presidential Ukrainian 

elections, he’s more interested in being recognized as, uh, an 

international player than really building an empire.   But if he 

feels, in order to be recognized as player he needs to play an 

empire, he would, and he does.  Three.  The United States 

grumble about Putin’s international policy, but loudly talks about 

his internal policy.  But actually disagreements on how to run a 

state is not enough to make an enemy.  Just look at Saudi 

Arabia.   While in foreign policy, the discussion actually does take 

place.  Here I would like to quote quite commonsensical 

Condoleeza Rice during the talks on the US missile defense plan 

in Eastern Europe.  And I quote.  “Even though we have our 

differences, we have a great deal in common, because that which 

unites us in trying to deal with threats of terrorism, of 

proliferation, is much greater than the issues that divide us.”   

She said it in Moscow on October 12th this year.  Moreover, even 

Dick Cheney, who came out of the Dr. Strangelove Cold War 

generation, and thus sees enemies everywhere, in 2006 Vilnius 

presentation, despite his tough talk on Putin’s backtracking on 

democracy said, and I quote, “None of us believes that Russia is 

fated to become an enemy,” so it’s not just George Bush.  There 

are smarter people who said that.  [LAUGHTER]   Um, let me 

develop on all three points.  To one, on ideological—on no 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 24. 

 

 

 

ideological divide.  In fact, Putin would argue that both Russia 

and the United States today are of the same ideology, that is 

democracy, and of the same economic system, which is 

capitalism.   In essence, he feels they disagree on tactics, 

methodology, and implementation.  The unifying context of his 

Presidency is that Russia will be great and strong if it continues 

to be a multi-party democracy.   But, despite the wishes of the 

West, it can’t exist without a strong leader.  President, Prime 

Minister, or wherever he chooses to continue to be.  In Russia, 

the economy is free, he says, but the state must control its 

wealth.  Therefore, Putin so bristles at suggestions that he’s 

backtracking on democracy.  At the Valde [PH] discussion club, 

uh, meeting in Solche [PH] this September, Putin criticized the 

United States’ criticism as a ploy.  And I quote.  “We see efforts to 

exploit the phraseology of democracy to influence over internal 

politics.  This is dangerous.  It undermines faith in the basic 

principles of democracy, if you need something from us you need 

to talk about the substance, not to approach it from another 

angle.   You need to re—you need to resolve Kosovo, talk about 

Kosovo.  You need to resolve the, uh, nuclear issue from Iran, 

talk about Iran.  Not about democracy in Russia.”   To number 

two.  On threatening so far imperial—Russia imperial ambition.  

Putin’s message that Russia is a great powerful and divinely 

ordained state, that stretches back 1000 years, and the fact that 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 25. 

 

 

 

he’s there to restore its glory and its proper place in the world, is 

very much embraced by the Russians, as Mr. Rosenkranz 

indicated.   At times, it may sound like boastful animosity.  But 

this tough imperial-sounding stunt is only a logical 

consequences—consequence of the brutal disappointment of the 

Russians with the course of events since the collapse of 

Communism.   Poverty, politic wars, crony privatization, the 1998 

financial crisis, along with the humiliations, perceived and real, 

uh, inflicted the West, from the NATO expansion to endless 

preaching.  As Russians see it, it is Putin’s no-nonsense rhetoric, 

and his firm actions both at home and abroad, that allowed—

allows him, in just a dozen years, to lead the country from 

bankruptcy and despair to wealth and power.  Which in Russia 

historically are thought of in imperial terms.   To number three.  

To common interests.  Putin is prepared to cooperate with the 

state.  Even if he promptly switches to confrontation when he 

senses a snub, like that Cheney talk in vil— Vilnius.  However, 

the Russian President’s and the US President’s…bickering is not 

about the future Cold War I think, but rather means the 

following, and these are my words, not theirs.   We’re annoyed at 

each other, for either country putting itself first.  Obviously, none 

lost superpower ambitions.  For not being what the other wants it 

to be.  But this is rather a political game, than a war, in a—an 

enemy public holder,  while we deal with much more pressing 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 26. 

 

 

 

issues that really preoccupy us, terrorism, nuclear threats, 

energy, security, and many, many more.  In conclusion, US-

Russian relations today certainly display annoyance, and some 

genetic Cold War-rooted suspicions.   

EDWARD LUCAS 

One minute—   

NINA KHRUSHCHEVA 

So the language of the Cold War creeps in, and is read as 

animosity.  But there is a serious recognition that there is plenty 

of common interest in the oil and energy strategy talks with Iran 

and North Korea and many others.   Let’s face it.  We all need a 

good enemy.  And while bin Laden is at large, and terrorism is 

still amorphous, and the fight with it is not going too well, Russia 

and the United States need their Cold War dance moves to pass 

time before they figure out what their relationship really is, or 

should be, when next year, the next administration, at least in 

America, comes in.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]

Thank you very much, Nina Khrushcheva.  Do keep passing your

J. MICHAEL WALLER 

Thank you, Edward.  It’s great to be here up in Manhattan, I

don’t get up here a lot but if—if I have to go back to Washington 

knowing that you folks ratified Dick Cheney’s views on Russia, 

uh, I don’t know what I’m gonna be doing for the next week but 

certainly Edward will have to change the lead of his article, uh, 

for next week.   Um…first, US Presidents since George Bush the 

elder, President Clinton, this current President Bush have bent 

over backwards, to make sure that Russia doesn’t become our 

enemy.  We’ve done practically everything possible from 

subsidizing their economy to looking the other way at a lot of 

their transgressions to make sure that, that, uh, that we don’t 

offend Russia, we don’t try to over…make them overreact.   We 

don’t criticize them too harshly and so forth.  And, uh…but while 

we were doing that we chose to look the other way, when certain 

elements of the old Soviet regime, uh, regained power, 

consolidated power with gangster interests that took advantage  

of the economic reforms, and seized control in the form of 

Vladimir Putin.   And that is the former secret police, uh, the 

Chekists, the KGB, who have managed to take control of a 

formerly— of a former democratic experiment, and turn it into a 

dictatorship.  And any secret police system in the world needs to 

have a foreign enemy in order to justify its own political grip on 

power.   So, given that, it’s the will of the Putin regime itself to 

have the United States as an enemy, and to become an enemy of 

the United States in order to perpetuate itself in power.  This was 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 28. 

 

 

 

revealed in Kommersant Daily in, in early 2000, after Putin 

became President, when Putin’s chief of staff and the state 

security chief Petrushev, got together and they decided the 

democratic institutions should not be nurtured.  In fact they 

should be, uh, there should be a return to, to rule by force in 

Russia.  And they recommended exceeding the Constitutional 

limitations on the power of the Presidency, to create this 

dictatorship.   And to create the nec—necessary conditions not 

just in Russia, but in the near abroad, which is the old 

Sovietspeak for the, for the former Soviet empire.  So there was a 

clandestine manipulation and, and oppression of political parties, 

of politicians.   We saw the faces of, of, of one of the Ukrainian 

politicians who, who happened to run afoul of them.  Another one 

of those politicians, Galina Starovoitova was on our editorial 

board,  she was murdered before, before this document 

happened but another one of our members of our editorial board, 

Yuri Shekoshekin [PH], uh, editor, very brave editor was, was 

poisoned to death, uh… as a—as a staunch critic of the KGB-

ization of the new Russian government.   This document, uh, was 

designed to promote Putin as the President, and to, and to wage, 

quote, “preventive political action.”  Throughout Russia, and to 

plant KGB personnel, throughout the Presidency,  throughout 

the government ministries, in control of the armed forces as it 

never had been before, and in control of governorships, and

administrative regions across the country.   At the same time 

there was no accountability or national reconciliation so if you 

look at, at South Africa after apartheid they had truth 

commissions to uncover the crimes of the past, or Chile, or 

Argentina, or El Salvador, or Poland, or East Germany, or the 

Czech Republic.   Or so many other countries that had been 

under a tyrannical government, had tried to come clean and 

expose the secrets of the past and the—and the—and those who 

were responsible for committing those crimes against humanity.   

That was never the casein Russia.  Where there was a de-

Stasification campaign in East Germany against the Stasi, there 

was nothing of the sort in Russia.  So no one has brought—been 

brought to trial, no one has been, been exposed or held 

accountable for any of the crimes of the past.   And as a result of 

that lack of accountability, and lack  of national introspection, it’s 

become normal among most Russians to be treated as they had 

been.  And so there is no coming to terms with the past, no 

break…no de-Nazification, imagine having a, a free West 

Germany without de-Nazification.   And allowing former Gestapo 

to stay in their posts, and even become President of the country, 

it—it’s the moral equivalent there.  So, all—over time they’ve 

whittled away at human rights, they’ve whittled away with—at a 

free press and everything else.   At the same time, this summer, 

the Russian government came out with an ideological guidelines 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 30. 

 

 

 

[sic] for social studies and history for public schools in Russia.  

And it’s a Kremlin-imposed guideline.  Putin himself addressed 

the teachers and the academics at the book launch, he said, “We 

must not allow others to impose a feeling of guilt on us.”   In the 

Washington Post coverage of, of this event, uh, they surveyed the 

sto—social studies guide, they said it’s, quote, “marked by 

intense hostility to the United States.”  And the editor of the 

manual, Leonid Polyakov, said “We are developing a national 

ideology that represents the vision of ourselves as a nation, as 

Russians, a vision of our own identity, and the world around us.”   

A paranoid, hostile, enemy-oriented identity.  Stalin in these 

books is shown, for the teachers’ guidelines in the Russian public 

schools he’s shown as, quote, “the most succ—successful leader 

of the USSR.”  And the guidelines on teaching about Stalin’s 

crimes are so ambiguous, that they’re not even required in 

Russian public schools.   And the last chapter of the history 

guidebook…lays out a new cult of personality of the new Russian 

President.  Quote, “We see that practically every significant deed 

is connected with Vladimir V. Putin.”  So this cult of personality 

is being built, they require some foreign adversary to, to justify 

the repressive measures they take.   Now the iconography of the 

old KGB has been preserved, imagine if, if after de-Nazification in 

West Germany, they’re—the old symbols were still preserved of 

the, of the, of the, of the Nazi party.  Yet if you go to the Russian 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 31. 

 

 

 

police stations, they have the sword and shield, that’s the old 

Bolshevik Cheka secret police symbol.   You go to the Foreign 

Intelligence Services offices, they have the same symbol, you go 

to the FSB State Security Services, they have the same symbol.  

You go to the, to the state prosecutor, they have the same 

symbol.   So that same conscious iconography of the past, where 

the sword was there in Drz—Felix Dzerzhinsky’s words, to, “to 

protect the revolution even if it came down on the heads of the 

innocent.”  This is the type of system that Russia’s preserving.  

You have an out-of-control spy services [sic], where corruption, 

uh…contract killings, bombings since Putin has been, uh, suc— 

was first state security chief and then Prime Minister, and then 

President.   The Russian military intelligence, which feeds on 

paranoia, the same way it did in the Soviet times, that—that 

organization has not been reformed at all.  Yet, that continues to 

feed on paranoia, uh, of the paranoia, in its intelligence reporting 

to the Russia military and political leadership, that the West is 

still a great threat.   Organized crime is, is rampant in a country 

with a huge secret police system that could easily crush it if it 

wanted to.  Journalists who investigate organized crime have 

been murdered, especially those investigating the organized crime 

in St. Petersburg, where Putin used to handle hard-currency 

operations before he came to, to, uh, Moscow.   When he took 

power as President he stuffed the government with KGB people,

—of the military.  Military reform has not occurred.  In fact the 

military is modernizing, they have an intercontinental ballistic 

missile force, brand new, modern force, the Topol-M.  They don’t 

need it.  We’re not their enemy, they don’t need it.   Right now as 

we’re speaking, the Yuri Dolgoruky which is a new Borei class, 

uh, submarine, nuclear submarine, is undergoing its sea trials 

now, new ballistic missile submarine, more modern than 

anything we have, they don’t need it.  They’re building—uh, an 

aircraft-carrier fleet is in their budget for the next few years as 

well, as a power-projection force.  This is not a sign of a country 

that’s seeking to be an ally of the West, and every sign that 

intends…that the intent is in the future to have the capability to 

be our enemy if the political climate so declares.  Thank you.   

[APPLAUSE]

MARK MEDISH 

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming this 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 33. 

 

 

 

evening, particularly if, uh, you’re voting against the motion.  I 

urge you to reject the motion, ladies and gentlemen.  To reject 

it…is not at all to defend Russia, or to defend Mr. Putin.  It is to 

be clear about US interests, and about realistic US policy 

options.  It’s to be realistic about the complexity of the world in 

which we have to conduct our foreign policy.  Indeed—indeed the 

motion is wrong for at least three main reasons in my view.  First 

it gets Russia wrong from the standpoint of US national security 

interests.   Whoever’s in the White House, whether a Democrat or 

a Republican, will have to advance those same US national 

security interests…many of which we share with Russia, that my 

colleagues have named, uh, and, and, these are absolutely vital 

to our national security.   Uh, for example, combating nuclear 

pro—uh, proliferation, uh, uh, counter— counteracting Islamic 

extremism around the world.  I’ll develop this a bit further.  The 

second reason that the motion…is wrong, is that it lacks 

historical perspective, and is incorrect on its face.   Russia is not 

the Soviet Union…the motion conflates the two, Russia could not 

be becoming our enemy again, this Russia has never been our 

enemy.  So the motion is simply wrong on its face.  If we were in a 

courtroom, I would ask the judge for a directed verdict.  And I 

urge you to consider one too.   Third, the motion is framed with a 

friend-versus-foe mentality, that is most likely…to lead us down 

the wrong path.  It misunderstands the world which is much 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 34. 

 

 

 

more complicated.  There’s a vast middle distance.  All those who 

are not our friends are not necessarily our enemies, and are not 

necessarily becoming our enemies.   It’s that difficult work in the 

middle distance, uh…that Russia, challenges us to do.  Russia’s 

becoming more difficult… indeed, in many, many ways.  But it’s 

not becoming our enemy, certainly not our enemy again.  We are 

not their enemy, they are not ours.   Russia may be its own worst 

enemy.  Indeed I think it is in many, many respects.  But that 

does not make it our enemy.  Again to go back to US national 

security interests, questions of this are not about metaphysics or 

metaphors.  They’re about concrete security interests.   Where we 

find interests in common with other countries, we must work  

together with them as best we can.  We may have disagreements, 

there may be friction, there may be deep disappointments and 

indeed there is great disillusionment and disenchantment in the 

mutual relationship today.   On both sides.  Nevertheless that 

doesn’t change our core national security interests, in containing 

weapons of mass destruction, in limiting the proliferation of 

fissile materials, in strategic arms control, in stability through 

Eurasia… and in the Middle East and in countering Islamic 

extremism around the world.   These are core issues, they have 

not changed recently for us, or for the Russians.  We need to do a 

better job working together, to address these interests.  Second, 

once again, the proposition simply cannot be correct on its face.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 35. 

 

 

 

Russia has not been our enemy before.  We are not talking here 

about the Soviet Union, or a return to the USSR.  Or a return to 

the gulag…or to rule by the Communist party.  So there is no 

“again” at play here.  And I urge you to take the words seriously, 

the words do matter, when we vote on a motion.  [PAUSE]   We 

don’t have a new Cold War coming.  It may be a cool peace, but 

that’s a very important distinction.  It’s disagreeable, it’s 

suboptimal, it’s difficult, but it’s not a war.  It’s a heightened 

challenge.  We go through this kind of debate in the United States 

periodically.  Who lost Russia.  Right?   The Red threat, we did it 

in—during our last political cycle, we’re doing it again now.  We 

ought to be careful about this, we need to separate the rhetoric 

from the reality and the rhetoric from what are the core US 

national security interests, that any President and any 

administration will have to serve.   Finally I wanna talk about the 

mind-set, the friend-foe problem.  Because it really represents a 

mentality that has gotten us into more trouble, uh, in recent 

times, and I think we need to steer clear of it.  We need, we need 

to pay careful attention to distinctions and details…in assessing 

the trend lines, lest, the friend-foe distinctions become a—a self-

fulfilling prophecy.   It simply need not be so.  It need not be so.  

Regrettably there are people in Russia, who think the same way.  

If we were in Moscow today, I’d be debating against them.  

Reminding them that the US is not their enemy and is not 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 36. 

 

 

 

becoming their enemy.  But so too I remind you today, Russia is 

not becoming our enemy.   There’s a vast middle distance.  Lots 

of difficult complicated countries.  China.  Pakistan.  Turkey.  

Saudi Arabia.  All countries where we could have…a long 

discussion, about the litany…of problems, of sorrows, of 

mistakes, as we’ve just heard about Russia.   It doesn’t make 

them our enemy.  It doesn’t mean that they’re becoming our 

enemy.  They are counterparts, partners with whom we have to 

work.  We have to work on a basis of shared interests where we 

can find them, and we have those with Russia.   We know who 

the real enemies are.  I don’t need to remind people, in this city 

certainly, who real enemies of the United States are.  In my view 

we can’t afford to shift our focus from our real enemies to our 

imagined ones.

In sum, once again, Russia may very well be its own  worst 

enemy, but that does not make it our enemy.  Thank you very 

much.

Well, thank you very much indeed, Mark Medish.  And I would 

hate to think that the legendary reticence and shyness of the New

Yorkers was going to prevail even on this occasion, so do, please, 

make yourselves known to the ushers, the ladies on the left and

don’t need to give your name if you don’t want to, I will find you 

just by the item of clothing which you like to be identified by.   

Um, if you’re from the press however we would like you to make 

your, um, to just identify yourself as from the press.  And we’re 

very keen to have audience participation here and be interactive.   

Now, um, we can now resul—um, announce, the results of the, 

um, vote that you, um, cast at the beginning of the evening.  And 

it’s this.  For the motion, 41 percent.  Against the motion, 23 

percent.  And undecided, 36 percent.   So there’s everything to 

play for, it could go either way by the end.  If you’ve made your 

mind up, may—if you’ve made your mind up once already you 

can already make it up again, as the, uh, as the discussion 

continues.   But I’d like now just to  come back to the panel and, 

and see if we can  get a bit of discussion going here and I’d like 

first of all to ask Bret Stephens to come back on the point that 

Robert Legvold made, about how this is just Russia wanting to be 

heard, this is, Russia is no longer on its knees, it’s an 

economically successful country with a popular President, with 

its own view of how things should be in the world.   And feeling 

that it really has the right to make itself heard and to have that, 

um, that view taken seriously, so, Bret Stephens, don’t you think 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 38. 

 

 

 

there’s, there’s something in that?    

BRET STEPHENS 

All countries have the right to make themselves heard, the 

French make themselves heard very, very vocally and often very 

effectively.  Um, uh, the same goes, it’s a, it’s an ordinary fact of 

international political  life.  But if you are, say, the President of a 

struggling young democracy called Georgia, and it is the middle 

of winter,  and you find that there have been two simultaneous 

gas epxlo—uh, pipeline explosions, that are piping in, uh, 

gasoline supplies, uh, to your country on, on Christmas eve, that 

is a very different way of making yourself heard.  The same 

happens, of course, if you, if you are Viktor Yushchenko, and you 

are campaigning for the Presidency of an independent country 

called Ukraine,  which nonetheless, Vladimir Putin and his, uh, 

friends in the Ukraine still consider a tr—satrap of the, uh, of 

Russia or excuse me, um, what they, uh, wish, uh, still was the 

Soviet Union.  And so, the way you go about dealing with Mr. 

Yushchenko, is by, um, administering a nearly lethal, uh, dose of 

dioxin, that is a very different way of making yourself heard.   If 

you are the Poles and you are trying to export simply meat 

products to Russia and they, and they will not, um, and they will 

not allow it on rankly mercantilist grounds, that is again a very 

different way of making yourself heard, and it is our contention, 

on this side—   We are not interested in making Russia another 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 39. 

 

 

 

enemy, we wish…with all respect to the psychoanal— analysis on 

the other side, we— as, as they— as Mark rightly pointed out, we 

have common, we ought to have common interests.   We really do 

have a common enemy in Islamic extremism.  But facts are facts, 

and when Russia or rather, this Russian government, makes 

itself heard, it makes itself heard by bullying, by violence and by 

intimidation.   

EDWARD LUCAS 

Um, Robert Legvold, do you think that answers your point that 

this is not just Russia making itself heard, it’s breaking the rules 

and doing things in an extreme and damaging way that disrupts 

the neighborhood and that must be something the United States 

has to, uh, try and counter.   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

I think that’s right, as my, the argument I’m making is not that 

Russian behavior is admirable in all respects and doesn’t pose a 

problem.  But I am saying that the major motivation for doing 

this kind of thing is as I described it, and often, I think we 

overlook that dimension of it.   My problem with the argument 

that’s being made by the other side right now is the risk of 

oversimplification.  The monochromatic picture that’s being 

presented, which, in its characterization of Russia, carries a very 

high risk of generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in the first 

instance,  and secondly, that is almost certainly going to be, uh, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 40. 

 

 

 

would, would recommend behavior on our part, that would be 

contrary to our national interests because of the stakes we have 

in being able to cooperate with Russia if we can move in that 

direction.   Even in terms of moving Russia domestically.  One of 

the, one of the questions that we need to ask the other side in the 

course of the evening, what do they wanna do about it.   And 

what they wanna do about it, well begin telling you what the risks 

are of acting on their characterization of Russia, as they present 

it.  Which is vastly oversimplified.  There’s nobody in this room 

that wants to as Mark said defend what’s happening in Russia.   

Not only is it disturbing to us, there are a number of things that 

have happened that are utterly reprehensible.  But it’s not only a 

black and white story.  I was witness to a conversation between 

Steve Hadley, who is our national security advisor, uh, the 

principle advisor to President Bush, and Vladimir Lukin, who is 

the ombudsman for human rights in the Soviet Union, a position 

that’s appointed by the duma.  Hadley’s point was…in Russia, 

I’m sorry.   Uh, Hadley’s point was that we wish well, we believe 

that democracy and building democracy’s very I mean in Russia, 

and as a part of that a free press is crucial, and we are very 

disturbed over the murder of Anna, Anna Politkovskaya.   Uh, 

and we— and it was clear that Hadley wanted a message carried 

back to Moscow on this story.  Lukin’s response was very 

measured and very careful, he said we are deeply concerned 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 41. 

 

 

 

about it as well in the ombudsman’s office.   As I said this is an 

official, he’s appointed by the duma.  He said that, there are—

there is an investment underway, he said we’re concerned 

because, not only Anna Stepanova but also two other editors 

from Novaya Gazyeta her newspaper, have been destroyed along 

the way.   The investment is very important to us, and he said the 

important thing is that at this stage the editors of Novaya 

Gazyeta which is one of the more open and critical newspapers, 

are satisfied with the way in which this—this process is 

proceeding.   And then he finished by saying that each year the 

ombudsman’s office for human rights makes four awards for 

advancing human rights in Russia, and this year the 

ombudsman’s office made that award to Anna Stepanova, and to 

Novaya Gazyeta.   Now, that’s not to deny all the other things 

that are very true.  The crackdown on the NGO’s, the closing 

down particularly of electronic media.  The unwillingness now to 

cooperate with the OSCE moving into the elections.  Maybe even 

the suspicion that officials at the—at a senior level were involved 

with the murder of Litvinenko.   But that’s still not a proven 

point, I mean, Lugovoy may be the murderer, but we don’t know 

that it traces directly to Putin.  And there are a series of these 

accusations that are being made tonight, that are simply too 

monochromatic.

EDWARD LUCAS  

Well Robert Legvold, let me—   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

[UNCLEAR] black and white—    

EDWARD LUCAS  

—just take—you made a very interesting point, what would the 

other side like to do about it, let me put that to Claudia Rosett, 

okay, imagine you were Secretary of State or National Security 

Advisor in some future administration, what would you be tell—

or even President.  What would you be, what, what policy would 

you be advocating, what should we be doing.    

CLAUDIA ROSETT 

Well, with due respect, I think the motion tonight is not what we 

should do…about the fact that Russia is becoming our enemy 

again, but is it becoming our enemy again.  And, uh, so, I’m 

actually not going to suggest a policy in reaction tonight, but, I 

would like to just mention that, from the opposing side, and, 

again I stress, I wish they were right, but I urge you to…look at 

what we are presenting, and vote that they are not.  Um, we’ve 

heard about, and I’m quoting here, “the cool peace.”   “The 

challenge.”  “The heightened challenge.”  Uh, and we’ve also 

heard the Saudis described as a…good example of…a country 

that—with which we may have disagreements but they are not 

our enemy.   That might be a good subject for a future debate.

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 43. 

 

 

 

Uh—  [LAUGHS]  And, I would suggest that, what we’re…actually 

listening to here is, uh… the difficulty of figuring out what to do 

about the fact that, yes indeed, Russia is becoming our enemy 

again.    

EDWARD LUCAS  

Thanks very much, Claudia Rosett, and I know Mr. Rosenkranz 

is in the audience and I’m sure he’ll bear that in mind when he’s 

planning the next, uh, next schedule for debates.  But I think it’s 

time to take a—take a question from the audience, and I’m going 

to, um, go for the right-hand aisle.   Um, Mr. Barry Wade, if you’d 

like to identify yourself, um, I believe you’re wearing—yeah, down 

at the front here.  And, uh, you’re wearing a red tie and you’ve 

put that on your card and that’s very good so I can see you, and 

a microphone is making its way to you right now, so please, sir, 

state your question.   

BARRY WADE 

As I understand some remarks that Garry Kasparov has made 

recently on his book tour in the United States, uh, he charges 

Putin with, essentially devoting his administration to the support 

of oil prices, and creating turmoil throughout the world, for the 

specific purpose of increasing oil prices, essentially so that he 

and his friends can pocket the money.   That it’s really about the 

money, it’s not about geopolitics.  My question is, is Kasparov 

correct and if so what does that say about tonight’s proposition.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 44. 

 

 

 

EDWARD LUCAS  

That’s an excellent question, I’m gonna give it first of all to Nina 

Khruschcheva.  What do you think about, uh, Garry Kasparov’s 

analysis of what’s happening.   

NINA KHRUSHCHEVA 

Um, well, Garry Kasparov is…speaking and very popular in the 

West, he is very much, uh, called for, his opinions are called for.  

Um, not so much in Russia and in fact I must say that for a lot of 

Russian observers, in fact, uh…Garry Kasparov often becomes a 

nuisance because he also simplifies the real problem that Russia 

faces and, uh, uh, takes away attention from, um, detailed 

policies that, that could be, uh, presented and, um… and 

designed.   As for this assumption, I have to say I sort of agree 

with them, that, uh, Putin’s Russia is quite a bit about money, I 

mean, Khodorkovsky’s story, Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s story, as 

the Russian saying goes, they broke the YUKOS company just to 

give Putin, um, um…the, the dowry for his daughters.   Uh, so 

that’s—I mean it’s, it’s oversimplification probably but the money 

certainly is a huge, huge, uh, huge part of, of, uh, the Putin 

story.  However, it’s not exactly part of that.  Because, um, Putin 

also, uh, tries to establish the Russian ideology, as—well not the 

Russian ideology,  sort of reestablish the, um, the, um, greatness 

of the Russian state, and I think that he’s very much preoccupied 

with.  And he—he believes that the state needs money to do that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 45. 

 

 

 

so I’m not quite sure that, uh, all the Kasparov’s assumption that 

it all goes to him personally is quite correct,  I think they do put 

it, uh, to, uh, to work into sort of creating, uh, the state strength.  

So, um, as, uh, my, um… colleague suggested, in discussing 

Russia we need not to, uh, look at black and white and,  and, uh, 

and simplification but really see it, um, see what kind of real 

policies are happening and, uh, exactly what, what’s behind 

those decisions and policies.    

EDWARD LUCAS  

Well Nina Khruschcheva, thank you very much for that, let me 

put that point then to, um, Michael Waller, you’ve written 

extensively about corruption at the highest levels in Russia, and 

if it really is, um, just a front for corruption, all this xenophobic 

and imperialist rhetoric, then, isn’t in a way that—  make—

doesn’t that make it impossible for Russia to be our, our enemy 

because they’re only really interested in self-enrichment.  

[LAUGHTER]    

J. MICHAEL WALLER 

Well…  [LAUGHS]   

EDWARD LUCAS 

We can buy them off.    

J. MICHAEL WALLER 

 [LAUGHS]  Well, we really—with oil prices it’s like kinda hard to 

find a—a better way to buy them, we certainly don’t have any 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 46. 

 

 

 

influence with them with our loans anymore with the IMF.  But 

with the, uh…  In—in fact it was, uh, Boris Fyodorov the early 

finance minister in the democratic Russian government who 

waned us that, uh, don’t loan us a billion dollars from the IMF 

because that’s, that’s not enough to help us and it’s too much to 

fuel corruption.   But when you look at Putin’s background where 

he was in St. Petersburg as a KGB guy handling foreign currency 

transactions, hard-currency transactions with no checks and 

balances,  his, his qualifications were that he was a liaison officer 

to the East German Stasi, for several years.  In fact that was his 

nickname in St. Petersburg, Stasi.  So, so you have a—so, so 

Stasi comes to, to Moscow to run the Presidential Property 

Administration.  The, the notoriously honest Boris Yeltsin 

administration’s property-management system, where his 

daughter also had great, uh, economic interests at stake.  So 

here, he, he, he’s the money-mover, he’s the money-hider, he’s 

the one with the KGB contacts to, to, networks to, make sure 

everything can be done quietly, and efficiently.  Uh, but at the 

same time, he’s a patriot, he does love his country.  And you can 

have crooked patriots.  And so, so, he’s using oil revenues and 

gas revenues to finance a huge military, uh, uh, modernization 

program that’s a—not a reform, not to reform the military ‘cause 

they still have their beatings of their troops and all of this other 

nonsense but it’s to modernize with force projection and with 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 47. 

 

 

 

weapons of mass destruction.   Um, using that currency for that, 

for infrastructure development, and for other things that will 

ensure that he and his people are kept in power, they cannot 

leave power because if they do leave power they’ll be arrested 

or—or worse, because of the crimes they’ve committed.   So, so, 

so you have sort of a, a, uh, a, uh, a, a Mobutu-type system here, 

uh,  only Russian-style, uh, where you have a more— much more 

efficient administration than Mobutu ever had but unlike 

Mobutu, uh, Putin’s not looting everything.  He’s leaving a lot, for 

the Russia public, for the pension system and for others so that 

he gets a perm—permanent support base probably for the rest of 

his life.   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

Edward, let me—   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Yes, do—   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

—respond to something that—   

EDWARD LUCAS 

—do, do, do come—Robert Legvold, do come, do come back on 

that.   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

Uh, respond to what Michael’s just been saying, one of the 

phrases he uses, “this enormous military modernization.”  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 48. 

 

 

 

Military modernization within Russia.  You know what the 

Russian military budget is this year?  It’s $31 billion.  You know 

what our military budget is, $430 billion.   Our military budget is 

half the GDP of Russia, at this point.  Secondly, he talked about 

the modernization of strategic forces including this nuclear 

submarine, which is be—behind schedule, it’s only one, and 

serious analysts on the Russian side that know this and are very 

critical of foreign policy in the Putin regime, like General Dvorkin, 

and Alexei Arbatov, are very concerned about a different kind of a 

problem because if we really do move in this direction where we 

are adversaries and we do begin again, engaging the nuclear 

contest,  then somewhere around 2015, Russia because of the 

attrition of its forces, its weakening of its strategic forces, will be 

forced to what is called a launch on warning policy which is very 

destabilizing, it’s the part of the world that we’ve forgotten about.   

As we concentrate on these other problems, in addressing that, 

we have to deal with the Russians.  We are together still 90 

percent of the nuclear weapons in the world when we talk about 

the nuclear haves, we need the Russians, not just in energy, not 

just in dealing with issues of regional instability and nuclear 

nonproliferation, or weapons of mass destruction.   But indeed of 

working this problem of stability within the Eurasian heartland.  

What they’re talking about in terms of the tension in Russia’s 

relations with Georgia or the things that the Russians are doing 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 49. 

 

 

 

with Ukraine, they’re quite right.  That really is a threat.   We 

need to work that problem.  How are we gonna work the problem, 

Claudia says, we don’t have to talk about what the implications 

are of this.  I’m saying, everything matters because the way you 

phrase this  problem is not cost-free.    

EDWARD LUCAS  

Let me just straight back to Michael Waller, the Russian military 

is very weak and we’d be safer if they had more nukes.    

J. MICHAEL WALLER 

That’s sort—yeah.  [LAUGHTER]  Well, and they’re spending their 

money in the, the, the nuclear weapons program with the Topol-

M SS-27 ICBM, they, they boast that it can break through our 

missile defense systems yet they complain about how dangerous 

our missile defense system is.   It doesn’t matter whether their 

submarine has had problems or it’s over schedule, they’ve laid 

the keels for two more of them.  And the current one is at sea 

trials now and it is a very advanced piece of equipment and it’s a 

revolutionary design so it’s going to have problems.  We can’t 

pooh-pooh these things.  We can’t pretend they don’t exist.  

They—the, the projected military budget is to build a new 

strategic, long-range nuclear bomber, and long-range nuclear 

cruise missiles to go aboard those bombers.   We can’t pretend 

these things away.  This shows, this shows intent of the Russian 

political and military leadership, and it’s something that we’re 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 50. 

 

 

 

going to have to grapple with, we can’t call them friends for 

behaving this way.    

EDWARD LUCAS  

But let’s—on the subject of missiles there’s an excellent question 

from the audience, last row, left side, Marvin D. Resnick.  If you’d 

like to identify yourself, um…I see a hand, it’s right up at the 

back there, if you can, uh…  Ushers are sprinting towards you 

with microphones.   Both of them at once, it’ll be interesting who 

gets there first.  [LAUGHTER]  Um, but, um…Marvin Resnick, 

the, um, please, please, give us your question.    

MARVIN D. RESNICK 

Do—do you ask me to repeat the question?    

EDWARD LUCAS  

Um, yes, would you—I mean I can say it for you but I thought 

you might like to say it yourself—   

MARVIN D. RESNICK 

Oh, okay.  Oh, that when we, uh, when we had détente, and, uh, 

the Russians, uh, withdrew militarily, we kept our missiles in 

Europe, ostensibly, to be directed at the Middle East supposedly.  

And I’m wondering if that didn’t…turn Putin, into a cynic who 

said well I can’t trust the United States if they’re gonna keep their 

missiles there, and that—that set him off on a, uh, shall I say, a 

right-wing course.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 51. 

 

 

 

EDWARD LUCAS  

Right.  Well I think it’s very interesting in this context to look at 

the American missile defense bases in, um, which are planned for 

Poland and the Czech Republic and have been very controversial 

there, so let’s wrap that together, let me put that to Claudia 

Rosett, do you think that, um, if—how,  how justified is Putin in 

seeing after-NATO expansion when he was promised, Russia was 

promised that there’d be no NATO, big NAT—NATO bases in the 

former Warsaw Pact countries and now here we are building two 

quite important ones.   Aren’t the Russians justified in feeling a 

little bit antsy about this, a little bit par— paranoid?    

CLAUDIA ROSETT 

Uh…I think that from the Russian point of view if anything it’s 

one more convenient excuse.  I mean the, the—could we back up 

here for a minute.  Um…when…the Russian government came in, 

building on the debris of the Soviet Union, and in many ways it is 

the same Russia…   In fact the basic framework for many things, 

is the same Russia.  Um, they had an enormous challenge ahead 

where the great hope was that they would build a genuine 

democratic state, and that required great concentration on 

internal reforms.  And more and more, what we’ve been listening 

to, is a focus on external enemies.  On ways of avoiding that kind 

of…of actually dealing inside.  What you got instead, was this 

criminal state, which, is going to basically take anything that’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 52. 

 

 

 

convenient and use it for a sort of rallying point.   So, should he 

be concerned?  We’re not about to attack Russia.  Um, and I 

don’t think that we’re arguing here this evening that Russia is 

about to physically attack the United States, we’re not worried 

that with their military budget they’re going to launch missiles 

that will hit New York next week.   Uh, what we’re worried about, 

is that they have become a force that is antagonistic, or they are 

becoming increasingly antagonistic to our interests, and, could I 

just suggest that this is not only military.  On the diplomatic 

front, if you follow the United Nations, Russia is over and over 

again at loggerheads with everything that is in the US interests, 

uh, both in the debate that’s gone on in Iran, uh, in the effort to 

enforce sanctions on Iraq they were the number-one cheaters.   

Uh, have done nothing about that, there’s been no investment, 

nothing, well, we have federal prosecutions here into people who 

did dirty deals.  Um, and, if you go to things like the Human 

Rights Council, you will find Russia and its votes lining up 

squarely with countries that I think you can reasonably call 

enemies of the United States,  if you would accept, you know… 

countries like…uh, let’s see, I’m thinking on the Human Rights 

Council…we get into Saudi Arabia again, but in the votes at the 

UN— forgive me, I need to parse out the councils, at—with more 

time.   But, they line up with Iran, with Cuba, with Sudan, with 

Syria, with countries that are very much opposed to the US 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 53. 

 

 

 

interests, it’s that kind of, growing…sort of, that trend—  

EDWARD LUCAS 

Right—   

CLAUDIA ROSETT 

—that we’re talking about tonight.    

EDWARD LUCAS  

Mark Medish, um, against the motion, do you wanna come back 

on that?   

MARK MEDISH 

I would, I’d like to go back to the gist of the question because I 

think it, it, it really brings up an important point, that, that again 

if we were sitting in Moscow,  we would hear from, from people 

there a long bill of particulars about how they feel that Russia 

has been slighted, in, in the post-Cold War period.   Uh, how the 

US, uh, uh, advanced its interests, in an unconsultative manner, 

uh, um, against Russia’s interests, and you named one area, uh, 

of, of the forward basing of missiles, the NATO enlargement 

which the US had, had actually promised to rule out, uh, during 

the process of German unification but that, that went forward.   I 

think it’s good that it did but it irritated the Russians.  Uh, the 

unilateral abrogation of the ABM treaty, by the Bush 

administration in its first months in office.  That angered the 

Russians, it annoyed them, the unilateralism of it in particular.   

The fact that promises have been made about the lifting of the

Jackson-Vanek Amendment.  Promises not kept.  So there’s a 

long list on that side as well.  We have a list.  We need to cut 

through this.  We need to cut through this, because these…bills 

of particulars, don’t actually add up to a hostile enemy 

relationship.   We need to bear in mind, in America, that other 

countries are allowed to have national security interests as well.  

And they’re allowed to interpret those themselves.  And they 

won’t always line up perfectly.  There’ll be friction.  And we’ve 

gotta work out issues, that are at the, at the, uh, uh, tension 

points.   [And missile defense is a great example that, that Ed 

brought up.  The US has a bold concept of missile defense.  Well, 

not everybody in the world is, is comfortable with it, including 

amongst our European allies.  And the Russians have problems 

with it or claim to have problems with it.   I think what Secretary 

Rice and Secretary Gates did in Moscow, a couple of weeks ago 

was actually quite productive.  They went there and they listened 

to the Russian views, as to how this project could perhaps be 

done better in a—in a cooperative manner, and I think they’ve 

made some progress in that regard.   And so I—I commend the 

Bush administration for opening its ears, and, and trying to avoid 

the self-fulfilling prophecy, of believing the rhetoric.  And by gosh 

there’s a lot of rhetoric out there.   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Well let me just follow up on that with another question to the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 55. 

 

 

 

people opposing the motion.  Um, that there’s—I think a 

consensus here that the mood in Russia is quite anti-Western 

and a lot of the, um, propaganda or, or stands taken by the, um, 

the media in Russia stokes this up, we heard about textbooks, 

it’s, it’s in the media as well.  Um, I’d like to ask Nina 

Khrushcheva, um, who’s, uh, speaking against the motion—  

Isn’t there a danger that people actually start believing this, even 

if this anti-Western propaganda that paints, paints America and 

the West as, as Russia’s enemy, even if it doesn’t, um, take effect 

right now when the problem is still, um, dealable with, it’s surely 

only a matter of time before that propaganda starts taking effect 

and, and we’ll—they’ll, they’ll get what they wish for.   

NINA KHRUSHCHEVA 

Absolutely, there is always a danger with propaganda, uh, it 

could be successful or unsuccessful and Putin’s propaganda is 

incredibly successful because as you know, not only that he has 

tough stands on, on, uh…uh, on America, sometimes, on, um…  

international  debate, but he also walks around half-naked in 

Siberia,  showing off his abs, I mean and this is the most 

successful propaganda you can have, all of a sudden Russia has 

a President that is better than James Bond.  I mean that’s, uh, 

that is a very powerful, powerful, uh, message, and in fact,  I 

think this message is, is also created because, um, as I think, uh, 

Bob mentioned, uh, the military exercises threatening as they 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 56. 

 

 

 

may look, in fact they’re not really going that well, and we also 

know that Russia’s, um, uh, Russia’s technology or at least 

implementation of, of, uh, service, uh, is no longer what it was 

during the, the Soviet period when the training was, was good, in 

fact excellent, now it’s sort of all over the place so they may come 

up with some latest technology but they have no idea how to 

service it,  I mean, you know, let’s face it, even KGB now has the 

third-rate people there, so there is a certain danger that it could 

happen.  But, you know, I’m the only Russian here so I can 

speak from experience.   Um, uh, Russians are only gullible to a 

certain extent.  And, uh, when they really realize, because so far 

the words actually kind of correspond, whatever they wanna 

believe, but, the minute it stops happening, I can assure you, 

dissidentship   will come back as it was in the ‘50s and ‘60s or 

what we’ve never seen before.   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Thanks [UNCLEAR]—Nina Khrushcheva, very briefly, Bret 

Stephens, you [UNCLEAR] come back on in, on, on, on that—   

BRET STEPHENS 

On a, on a couple of points, first of all to Nina’s point, um, 

incompetence is not intention.  If the Russians are building 

brand-new nuclear missile submarines which is, um, a, uh, I 

would say a bizarre project given the shambles of their regular 

forces and, uh, what their needs are, the fact that they’re not 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 57. 

 

 

 

building them well or the sea trials aren’t going well, uh, doesn’t 

address the basic point which is that this is what they intend to 

do.  So that’s, that’s a point that needs, uh, to be, uh, made.  I 

wanna, um, get back to something that Mark said as well.  Um, 

which seems…  First of all, I, I’m, I’m delighted, that we have 

found finally a bipartisan moment where a former Clinton 

administration official is handsomely praising the diplomacy of, 

of, um, of, uh, the successors, and, and I find this one of the 

ironies of this conversation.   Um, but this comes from a kind of 

school of, what, what Mark said comes from a kind of school that 

this is all big un— misunderstanding we have with the Russians.  

They have one view of the world, we have a different view of the 

world.  We need a kind of therapy session to work through, uh, 

um, these kinds of misunderstandings and while that is true, uh, 

in some ways, I don’t think it can really account, um, either for 

Russian behavior, or, as Michael said, um, the efforts by two if 

not three American administrations to bend over backwards for, 

uh, um, to—and make excuses for the Putin government, in fact 

one of the great complaints I hear when Russian, uh, usually 

dissident figures come through our offices at The Wall Street 

Journal, they will say, why is your President constantly… 

forgiving, acquiescing, making excuses, for, um, uh, for Vladimir 

Putin.   There—there’s one other point I’d like to make if I can—if 

I—

EDWARD LUCAS 

15 seconds if you can squeeze it in.   

BRET STEPHENS 

Well, it’s, it’s an issue that someone here needs to address, which 

is, uh, yes, the United States and Russia, um, ought to have 

common interests, and yet strangely the Russians seem to work 

at cross-purposes with what we would say at this table are their 

basic interests.   Why are they building a nuclear reactor at 

Bushehr, which Mr. Putin just said he is ready to complete, 

which in a period of about 15 months, will create 330 kilograms 

of spent fuel, which can easily be reprocessed into about 50 to 60 

Nagasaki-type bombs, is that the Russia interest?   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Right, well we now move on to the final, um, uh, part of the, the 

debate, where the, um, members of the panel will be able to come 

back and make final points, I could see Mark Medish was itching 

to come in there on Michael Waller but you will have a chance in 

your peroration to, um…uh, to respond to him.   So, we are going 

to go in reverse order, so the first, um, uh, person to, to 

conclude, um, from the side against the motion, that Russia is 

not becoming our enemy, is Robert Legvold.  Robert.   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

This is a country with an enormous number of major foreign 

policy problems, and the next administration Republican or 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 59. 

 

 

 

Democrat are going to have to—is going to have to review the 

whole gamut of US foreign policy, not just struggle with this 

problem of the Iraq war.  I think the last thing that we wanna do 

at this point, what we do wanna do is reduce the number of 

problems, we don’t want needlessly to add problems.  As I’ve 

said, phrasing the issue as though Russia is becoming the 

enemy, which has implications for action, is not cost-free.  And at 

a time when we have so many issues where cooperation with 

Russia is important, and it’s not absent, we’re getting it in a 

number of important respects—  It’s—it is the struggle on global 

terrorism, there is still essentially a cooperative relationship in 

dealing with that problem.  In addressing the questions of Islamic 

extremism, there is still essential cooperation in that area.   And 

in terms of strengthening the non-proliferation regime, including 

the North Korean issue, there is still cooperation between our two 

sides.  But addition [sic] on other issues like, the relationship 

among—   

EDWARD LUCAS 

One minute—   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

—the nuclear powers, the problem of weaponization of space, 

that most of us are not focused on, the problem of lowering the 

nuclear threshold and making nuclear weapons usable,  bunker-

busters on our side, incorporating nuclear weapons into 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 60. 

 

 

 

conventional doctrine on the Russian side…when 90 percent of 

the weapons are held by these two countries, Russia’s absolutely 

essential.   Now, if we are going to make any kind of progress, it 

doesn’t mean that we whitewash Russia or that we put our head 

in the sand or that we ignore all of the issues that the other side 

has raised so well about the reprehensible trends within Russia.   

But we’re still then left with the question of how we address those 

isshens [sic]—issues effectively.  Not in ways that give us 

emotional satisfaction.  But in ways in which we can make some 

progress.   The experience I have, is that if it’s done carefully and 

with certain segments within Russia including some that are 

fairly close to official circles, you can have a conversation about 

all of the issues that they raised.   

EDWARD LUCAS 

Thanks very much—   

ROBERT LEGVOLD 

And indeed the Russians are the ones that are raising these 

issues themselves as their critics inside—   

EDWARD LUCAS 

Robert Leg—  Robert Legvold, your time’s up, thank you very 

much.  Now, uh, for the motion, Claudia Rosett.    

CLAUDIA ROSETT 

Thank you.  Um, I think, um, we are not debating here whether 

Russia is the enemy or becoming the enemy.  We’re discussing 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 61. 

 

 

 

whether it is becoming our enemy…it is possible for the United 

States to have more than one.  In fact to have several.   Um, and, 

uh, in trying to frame what we’re actually talking about, um, the 

issue actually isn’t what we’d do about it.  That is a very 

important issue, it’s one worth debating and I once heard 

somebody say, well the first thing that we need to do is start by 

telling them what we need.  The thing that we rather neglected to 

do in the 1990s.   We were so busy worrying about what Russia 

needed, that we neglected to say, we as America need the 

following things.  Um, uh, there have been a lot of points raised 

here, the one I’d most like to just…refute is, that we are 

cooperating in Islamic extremism.   I would class in Islamic 

extremism the activities of Iran.  A genuine terrorist-sponsoring 

state, I think there’s no doubt about that.  And on that Russia 

along with China has been one of the main stumbling blocks in 

American efforts to actually stop that nuclear program.  Uh, in 

the larger picture, is Russia becoming our enemy, we can discuss 

many ways in which Russia’s aggrieved, challenged, needs 

validation, peeved, upset and so on.  But, we’ve heard here a list 

of things going badly wrong inside Russia itself.   What we’ve 

heard effectively is there is no real check on what is happening 

with the power that now accrues to the Kremlin.  And, the agenda 

that will follow is one where we’ve heard a list, as Bret gave you, 

of the kinds of things that come from that.  They are dangerous, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 62. 

 

 

 

they are inimical to the kind of values this country stands for.  

And in some things they’ve been downright confrontational, 

singling out the US.  I wanna tell you just a quick anecdote.  A 

wonderful—   

EDWARD LUCAS 

In eight seconds, please.   

CLAUDIA ROSETT 

An editor of mine once explained, the difficulty with defining 

insider trading.  He said it’s a very blurry line, when you really 

start parsing the cases, but if you find yourself walking around 

with suitcases full of cash, making calls from pay phones, you 

can have crossed that line.  And—   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Claudia Rosett, your time is up—   

CLAUDIA ROSETT 

—with enemy, may I just suggest that when you find yourself 

running a Geiger counter over the teapot, and trying to defend 

obvious interests of the free world—   

EDWARD LUCAS  

You’ve made your point.  it’s—   

CLAUDIA ROSETT 

Thank you.  [LAUGHTER]   

EDWARD LUCAS 

Uh—to the, to the people who are watching, uh, who are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 63. 

 

 

 

listening, um, on the podcast or on the radio at this point, uh, 

Claudia Rosett pointed at the blue teapot.  [LAUGHTER]  

Um…Nina Khrushcheva against the motion.    

NINA KHRUSHCHEVA 

Thank you, um, I would like to go back to what our side keeps 

arguing is that, um, what is the policy, what is to be done, 

because obviously, um, Russia is a difficult… case to defend 

today.  So when I was thinking how I would ret up [sic]— wrap 

up, um, provided that there would be some, there would be no 

surprises, and I started looking for, um, some great American or 

great British diplomats, because they seem to have, uh, really a 

lot of say about the Soviet Union at the time.  People like George 

Kennan and Isaiah Berlin, and actually, uh, please forgive me,  

would like to quote from Isaiah Berlin, who was a Russian 

Empire born British diplomat, political philosopher and historian 

of ideas.  And this is a short piece, 1946 written, why the Soviet 

Union chooses to insulate itself.  And here is the quote.  It is 

necessary to remember that the Russians do not believe a word 

we say, because they think they understand us more clearly than 

we do ourselves.  True or not, it has been centuries long 

convention that the west is to get them.  The only way to convince 

them is the British, and we can say the West, or the United 

States today, mean no harm, is simply by not meaning any, they 

will always judge behavior by deeds and not words.  If we follow 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 64. 

 

 

 

an undeviating policy with whatever we believe right for its end, 

making concessions where possible, but not letting the end out of 

sight, and if treat the Russians as any other great power, despite 

their odd non-reciprocal behavior, and do not answer back 

despite, despite their intolerable provocation, but firmly contrive 

to work for whatever seems in our and the world’s crucial 

interest, then we may hope for success.  Otherwise, the wrangle 

of policies will become an ideological, ultimately armed conflict, 

and end war, when principles equally unacceptable to liberal 

persons.  Thank you.   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Nina Khrushcheva, and Isaiah Berlin, thank you very much.  And 

uh, Bret Stephens, for the notion.   

BRET STEPHENS 

Uh, none of us on this side wish to see Russia, um, as an enemy 

again.  We are not looking for another enemy.  We have enemies 

enough in places like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq.  The 

battle against Islamic militancy and radicalism is one that we 

would do, we would do better to fight alongside Russia, not at 

cross purposes with it.  We also don’t want to needlessly 

antagonize Russia with rhetorical excesses.  But as Vaclav Havel 

said, told me when I interviewed him in June, with me, “Ras-

Putin,” as he called him, becomes more and more suspicious.  

We have to tell him plainly what we think of his behavior.  Mr. 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 65. 

 

 

 

Havel has a philosophy about that, it’s called living in truth.  So 

let’s tell Mr. Putin the truth, let’s tell ourselves the truth, the 

truth.  We worry about the political trends within Russia, not just 

because we are friends of democracy, human rights, freedom, the 

rule of law, but because the respect the governments have for 

their own people tend to correlate with their attitude and 

behavior vis-à-vis— 

EDWARD LUCAS 

One minute.  

BRET STEPHENS 

…the outside world.  We worry about Russian behavior toward 

countries like Ukraine, Estonia, and Georgia, because we fear 

that that behavior is a harbinger for what’s in store for Europe 

and the United States.  And we look on the trends in Russia, in 

Russian attitudes towards journalists, human rights groups, 

foreign investors, neighbors, toward their own history, and finally 

towards us with growing alarm.  And the direction seems clear 

and unrelenting, and it leads us to conclude that Russia is on its 

way toward again becoming an enemy of the United States, and 

we won't be able to do anything to change that until we come to 

terms with the reality that we are facing.  Thank you.   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Bret Stephens, thanks very much.  Mark Medish?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 66. 

 

 

 

MARK MEDISH 

There is no irony in my praise for, uh, the work of, of the present 

administration.  I come from a strong bipartisan tradition in US 

financial policy, and I, I wish the Wall Street Journal editorial 

board would rediscover that part of the American heritage.  

[APPLAUSE]  On Iran policy, uh, I just wanted to mention that 

Russia and Israel have both reaffirmed many times that they view 

each other as strategic allies.  After Putin’s visit to Tehran 

recently, he met with Ehud Olmert in Moscow, and the same 

statements and reassurances were made. And that, that gives me 

confidence, uh, that the Russians are not, are not beyond the 

pale on this issue, uh, but, but may in fact be part of the solution 

ultimately.  It’s a very difficult problem.  Once again, I urge you to 

reject this notion, rejecting it is not to defend Russia, and it’s not 

to defend Mr. Putin’s track record.  The motion should be 

rejected because— 

EDWARD LUCAS 

One minute.  

MARK MEDISH 

…of core US national security interests.  This is a question about 

core interests, not about metaphors or metaphysics. The 

proposition is wrong on its face. Russia could not be our enemy 

again, it, this Russia has never been our enemy.  We also should 

avoid Manicheanism in our financial policy.  We have enough real 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 67. 

 

 

 

enemies, let’s not imagine new ones.  Like China, Russia is a very 

difficult counterpart and partner.  It’s not our enemy.  Russia 

may be its own worst enemy, but that does not mean it’s 

becoming ours.  I urge you to reject the notion.  Thank you.   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Mark Medish, thank you very much.  And finally, Michael Waller.   

J. MICHAEL WALLER 

Thank you.  Not even al Qaeda is building a nuclear missile 

system that can wipe out our entire country.  And we, some of us 

want to turn a blind eye to those who are doing just that 

program, and they’ve budgeted it out through the year 2015.  

Now, we’ve had great relations at times, or common interests at 

times with the Bolsheviks, with our humanitarian programs after 

the Russian civil war, with Stalin during World War II.  We even 

offered him the Marshall Plan aid.  With, with Brezhnev and 

Andropov with trade, uh, and arms control, and with Gorbachev 

supporting glasnost and perestroika.  So even at our worst parts 

of relations with the Soviet Union we still, which was actually 

communist Russia, we still had a, a common relation.  It didn't 

take away the fact that they did want to destroy us.  But, I think 

what the danger now is that anti-government regime propaganda 

in Russia is so dominant, where they have shut down a free 

press, they have shut down all of the radio stations in Russia 

that broadcast Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, that’s US 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 68. 

 

 

 

broadcasting, except three or four, so they’ve effectively silenced 

us.  I believe they’ve silenced the BBC Russian broadcasts.  And 

then their propagandizing their children, that we are the enemy, 

that Stalin was not a bad guy, that, that Russia should not be 

held accountable for the crimes of the Communist past.  So, what 

the regime is teaching its children today tells us a lot about 

where that regime may be headed.  It doesn’t need to head that 

way.  What we need to do is call them on it, as we would call a 

friend or a neighbor or a wayward relative or somebody else, and 

try to stop them from taking this path that they’ve chosen to 

take.   

EDWARD LUCAS  

Michael Waller, thank you very much.  And now, ladies and 

gentlemen, it’s time for you to decide who carried the day.  And I 

hope you’ve still got your key pads here.  Um, it’s on the left arm 

rest of your seat, unless you're on the right, right aisle, in which 

case it’s on the other arm rest.  So, when I tell you to, press one if 

you're for the notion, two if you're against, and three if you're 

undecided.  So please cast your votes now.  Very good.  And while 

those, um, are being tabulated, and uh, we’ll hear the results in a 

moment, I want to first of all announce a few things before 

thanking both the debaters and the audience.  The next 

Intelligence Squared US debate will be on Tuesday November the 

13th here at the Asia Society Museum.  And the notion to be 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Russia is becoming our enemy again” (10/30/07) Page 69. 

 

 

 

debated will be a domestic one.  “It’s time to end affirmative 

action.”  Nice, uncontroversial motion.  It will be moderated by 

Robert Siegel, who many of you will know from NPR, and the 

panelists for that debate, for the notion, John McWhorter, who’s 

a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and columnist for the 

New York Sun; Terence Pell, who’s the President of the Center for 

Individual Rights; and Joseph Phillips, actor, social 

commentator, and syndicated columnist.  On the other side, 

against the motion, defending affirmative action, will be Khin Mai 

Aung, the staff attorney at the Asian American Legal Defense and 

Education Fund; Kimberlé Crenshaw, professor of law at UCLA 

and Columbia Law School, and Tim Wise, writer, activist, and 

educator.  Now, an edited version of tonight’s Intelligence 

Squared US Debate can be heard locally on WNYC, which is on 

AM820 megahertz on Sunday November the 11th at eight o'clock 

p.m.  So, if you really enjoyed it you can tune in and listen again.  

Or you can hear it for the first time.  And please check your local 

NPR member station listings for the dates and times of 

broadcasts outside New York City.  Um, no public appearance is 

complete without a plug, and copies of Robert Legvold’s book, 

Russian Foreign Policy in the 21st Century in the Shadow of the

very interesting.  It was a bad night to be undecided.  After the, 

um, after the debate, forty-seven percent of you were in favor of 

the motion, so small rise, but forty-one percent of you were 

against, which is a huge rise.  And only twelve percent were 

undecided. So, I declare the motion carried but by a much 

smaller margin than at the beginning.  So, both sides have some 

laurels to rest on.  So, thanks very much.  [APPLAUSE]  Good 

evening to you all.
