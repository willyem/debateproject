JOHN DONVAN 

Good evening, everyone.  Good evening, everyone.  I would like to 

begin our evening by introducing the CEO of Intelligence 

Squared US, Mr. Robert Rosenkranz.   

[APPLAUSE]   

 

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Thank you all for being here and welcome.  You know, there’s 

not much of a debate about whether mainstream media is 

declining.  The network evening news audience is shrinking, 

daily newspapers are folding, established magazine titles are 

being shut down.  Nearly one of every five newspaper journalists 

has been fired in the last couple of years.  Increasingly people

get their news from the Internet and from cable channels.    

 

In the past two years the number of people in the US going 

online for news has jumped 19 percent.  Advertisers are moving 

to Google and to other non-traditional sources.  But there is a 

very interesting debate about whether these developments leave 

us better off or worse off.   Now no one seriously questions that a 

free press is an essential national value.  And a free press does 

not come cheap.  The major networks and leading newspapers 

have traditionally spent heavily on the news, they support 

foreign news bureaus, investigative reporting, in-depth news 

analysis, fact-checking and other quality controls.   So why 

might we say, good riddance.  Perhaps it’s because mainstream 

media did exercise extraordinary power, to shape the national 

agenda, and our perception of events.  Might we be better off 

getting our news from an unfiltered Internet, to which all 

bloggers and news aggregators have equal access.   Should we 

not encourage a diversity of voices competing to provide 

information and analysis.  Can a network of bloggers tell us 

more about events on the ground than a reporter in a hotel bar 

in Baghdad or Cairo?  Or could we conceivably enjoy the best of 

both worlds, as mainstream media reinvents itself to thrive in a 

digital age.   These are interesting questions, I think we’re going 

to have a lot of fun hearing them debated tonight, and it’s my

pleasure to turn the evening back to John Donvan.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

[UNDER APPLAUSE]  Thank you.  And may I just invite one more 

round of applause for the person who makes all of this possible, 

Robert Rosenkranz.  [APPLAUSE]  Well, welcome, everyone, to 

another debate from Intelligence Squared US, I’m John Donvan 

of ABC News, and it is my honor once again to serve as host and 

moderator, as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me 

here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York 

University.    

 

Three teams—sorry, two teams, three against three, will be 

debating this motion, “Good riddance to the mainstream media.”  

And I know that we have a hall full of journalists here, a topic 

that is close to many of our hearts, if not many of our throats.   

But it is an important topic for debate, and that’s what this is, it 

is a debate, a contest.  There will be winners and losers tonight, 

and you the audience will be our judges, by the time the debate 

ends you will have voted twice, once before the debate, and once 

again after the debate on whether you side with or against the 

motion.  You pick the winners.   So let’s move on to our 

preliminary vote, and if you again look to the keypads on the left 

of your seats…that will be your little voting machine.  Press 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

number one if you agree with the motion, “Good riddance to the 

mainstream media,” press number two if you disagree with the 

motion, and press number three if you are undecided.   And if 

you make a mistake, just correct the mistake and the system will 

only record your last vote.   

[PAUSE, AUDIENCE VOICES]  

MAN IN AUDIENCE 

Do you have to log in first?  [LAUGHTER]    

JOHN DONVAN  

You do not have to log in.  You are logged in.  We hope.  All right, 

we’re going to lock it out…  [PAUSE]  So let’s get to the debate, 

our topic is “Good riddance to the mainstream media,” and this 

is a contest in which we hope to hear a clash of ideas and logic, 

and wit and perhaps humor,  as each team tries to change your 

minds and tries to persuade you to their point of view, and 

speaking first for the motion, “Good riddance to the mainstream 

media,” I’d like to introduce Michael Wolff, who in a way has one 

of the most mainstream of all media positions as a columnist for 

Vanity Fair but he also for some time has had a position on the 

other side of the technological divide having been involved in 

many Internet startups, including Newser.com which Michael, 

you say, has as one of its goals to kill newspapers, is that 

correct?    

MICHAEL WOLFF

Well, also to make me rich.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Make you rich, ladies and gentlemen…  [LAUGHTER]  Is that 

working out?   

MICHAEL WOLFF 

Oh yes, of course.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Michael Wolff—   

MICHAEL WOLFF 

Always—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—ladies and gentlemen.   

[APPLAUSE]   

MICHAEL WOLFF 

I went to work for the New York Times in 1973, and I was going 

to say that that probably makes me one of the people who’s been 

in this business in this room the longest.  But then I notice 

you’re an old crowd.  [LAUGHTER]  My…  [LAUGHTER]   My 

mother went to work as a daily reporter in 1942, my father 

began as an ad man in 1946, after the war.  So, the thing that I 

know is that this business is always changing.  So, the idea that 

somebody is going to defend the status quo of this business is to 

me a little silly.   And my first point is, that we ought to 

remember, that this business, the business that those guys are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 6. 

 

 

 

going to defend, is a new creation.  It’s at most, 20 years old.  

And it’s essentially—  And the other thing that’s going to happen 

is that they’re going to talk about the news business, and that’s 

not the proposition,  the proposition is the media business as it 

should be, because the news business has been subsumed by 

this superstructure.  Now this superstructure, which essentially 

is five companies which dominate the landscape—  Time Warner, 

Viacom-CBS, Newscorp, Disney, and NBC Universal.    

 

What these companies are are—listen to this—more than 1,000 

independent media companies, which in the past 20 years have 

been aggregated into five.  So what they’re going to be defending, 

is actually a business theory.  And the theory is we bring all 

these companies together, and we create value.   Here’s the 

point.  That theory has been all but utterly exploded.  Disproven.  

Break it down into its component parts.  Look at its 

constituencies.  From an audience point of view, the audience 

has been in flight for 20 years.  Just yesterday, what we’ve 

learned is that there was, newspapers have lost another 10 

percent of circulation, some newspapers are down in a year, 25 

percent.   You can see those numbers not just in newspapers, 

across the media landscape.  Television networks, books, 

magazines, the music business, the movie business.  And now 

the cable business.  People are in flight from what was supposed 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 7. 

 

 

 

to be the bastion of mainstream media.    

 

This is an extraordinary moment, it is a moment in which you 

see literally breakdown at every level.  The…  You have—it’s not 

only—you have an audience flight, you have an advertiser flight.   

What happens with advertisers, it used to be that consumer 

brands, you had 90 percent of consumer brand spending was in 

the mainstream media, that’s down to under 50 percent, why is 

that the case.  Because it doesn’t work anymore.   You have from 

a shareholder perspective, and this is key.  Shareholder 

perspective, what you have is—well actually you’ve been screwed 

if you’re a shareholder [LAUGHTER] in a modern media 

company.  Media moguls rich, shareholders across the spectrum 

of these companies, are underwater, not one of these companies, 

in… 20 years has kept pace with the S&P.    

 

This is a devastating result.  What you have is your customers, 

your—the consumer, the advertiser, and the marketplace itself, 

saying that there is something phenomenally wrong here.  

Technology.  The media is a technology business.  That’s what it 

is.  That’s what it has always been.  Technology changes, the 

media changes.  There is no media without technology.  We’re…  

We’ve come to a funny moment however in this business 

because the mainstream media is run by people who are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 8. 

 

 

 

fundamentally technology-phobes.   

 

They don’t get it, they don’t want to get it, they’re averse to it, 

they resist it.  They are lost when it comes to making plans 

about it.  I spent a lotta time in the recent past with Rupert 

Murdoch who runs I would say the leading-edge media company, 

and he runs it with an iron fist.   He doesn’t run it with a 

computer because he doesn’t use one, he doesn’t run it with 

email because he doesn’t get email.  And he can’t get that cell 

phone to work, he’s always kind of waving it…in the air.  

[LAUGHTER]  What you’re going to hear here tonight is that the 

media is necessary for the commonweal.   An informed citizenry 

is what this nation is about.  The media may be flawed but it 

delivers us what we need to know.  That is self-serving crap.  

[LAUGHTER]   I—  [INSTANT OF APPLAUSE, DIN OF VOICES]   

The New York Times, is a good newspaper, sometimes.  The 

Washington Post is a good newspaper.  The LA Times before it 

became a bad newspaper was a good newspaper.  [LAUGHTER]   

 

But after that, it’s off the cliff, it’s oblivion.  The news business in 

this country is nothing to be proud of.  What—  You know, I 

think the thing to remember here—I mean the really important 

thing is that something else is happening, something is…  This is 

easy.  Change—and I have four seconds—change is good.  And

it’s happening and we are part of it, and we’re going to all tell our 

grandchildren that, we were here, we saw the monster die, and 

we saw the shock of the new—    

JOHN DONVAN  

Michael Wolff, your time is up.  Thank you.   

MICHAEL WOLFF 

And—  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you.   

JOHN DONVAN 

I want to point out, I did not give you the structure of the 

evening, we are doing three rounds, Round 1 we’re in now is 

opening statements, Round 2, the debaters will go head to head, 

in Round 3 we’ll have brief closing statements.   We’re in— this 

is Round 1, opening statements by each debater in turn, they 

are seven minutes each, the closing statements will be two 

minutes each.  Now, moving on, the motion is “Good riddance to 

the mainstream media” and here to argue first against the 

motion is Phil Bronstein.  Phil Bronstein began his career as a 

television reporter and over the years moved to print and became 

ultimately the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, was there 

during the most difficult of times, and it was he who called the 

staff together, and said, the business model is broken, and no 

one knows how to fix it.  Phil, was there a “yet”?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 10. 

 

 

 

PHIL BRONSTEIN 

Yet.   

JOHN DONVAN 

“Yet,” in that, ladies and gentlemen, Phil Bronstein.   

[APPLAUSE]   

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

Well, you all look very young to me.  [LAUGHTER]  It’s a 

challenge to try and defend the vitality of something that’s 

already been declared dead.  And no one has been quicker to 

declare it dead than people who have been preachers of the 

mainstream media, rushing to write the obituary.   But let’s—

first of all, I should caution you, we should be very careful 

tonight, because, we can’t touch on certain topics because, we 

could all go to jail if we do.  What am I thinking, of course we 

can’t go to jail, we can talk about anything we want.   And one of 

the reasons we can talk about anything we want is because the 

institutions that have made up the mainstream media, not over 

the past 20 or 30 years but over the last hundred years, have 

provided the authority, and the experience and frankly, the 

money, to stand toe to toe with government and all-powerful 

institutions and individuals.    

 

For your rights, for all of our rights, and for the benefit of all of 

us.  I have some notes here because I’m a newspaper person, I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 11. 

 

 

 

like reliability to the extent that I get it.  [LAUGHTER]  A few 

years ago, we had two reporters at the Chronicle facing 18 

months in prison each, on the Balco steroids story, for refusing 

to be tools of government prosecution and in fact for just being 

reporters.   Well, we spent two years, in addition to the time we 

spent on the story, two years defending these reporters, and a 

million dollars.  Eve Burton, our chief corporate counsel at 

Hearst, who personally oversaw this case, I think is here tonight.   

That’s something that I’m not so sure, that these other emerging 

operations in media can do.  Do they have the money.  Does 

Talking Points Memo which does great work have the money, to 

do that.  Have the will to do that.  And you know the New York 

Times the other day just said that Barack Obama, about Barack 

Obama, the cover-up continues.    

 

So you may like this President more than you like the last one, 

but you may not like the next one.  Because I can tell you from 

the Balco case experience, that that was a concerted effort on 

the part of the Bush administration, to go after the press, and its 

ability to report.   I’m standing here very humbly tonight in the 

very long shadows of a lotta great editors, Ben Bradlee, John 

Carroll, Marty Barron, Gene Roberts, who are known for things, 

other than encounters with large reptiles, they’re known 

[LAUGHTER] for working to change our world very profoundly.

They do stories about the deaths of 300 kids in the Washington 

public school system.  Fraudulent fertility packages, Walter 

Reade Hospital took at least half a year to do, sexual abuse by—

of kids by members of the Catholic clergy, the Boston Globe, a 

year to do that.    

 

When Bill Keller went toe to toe with the Bush administration on 

domestic wiretapping you may not have liked the results of the 

negotiations but the fact that there was a debate, served us all.  

Served us all.  I’m not here to defend a business proposition.  As, 

I’ve already said, the business model’s broken, so I’m not going 

to do that.  What I am defending is the idea of sustained 

professional journalism done with integrity and done in the 

public interest.   And that is something that mainstream media 

has supported, we’ve gotten lost in all this business model 

discussion and disintermediation and granularization and it 

just, doesn’t get to the point.   Our death by the way, would be I 

think a little untimely for the 50 million people who still pay to 

get a daily newspaper, for the 74 million people who go online, a 

month, of daily newspaper sites, and even for the $38 billion 

worth of advertising that still exists.    

 

But, another issue I think that we should raise, in terms of the 

service that we provide, that mainstream media has supported 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 13. 

 

 

 

all these years, Freedom of Information Act requests.  Now, 

Freedom of Information Act requests are sort of like a New York 

apartment with a view.  They’re hard to get, it’s expensive, it’s 

time-consuming, but boy, what a result.  These are windows, on 

very dark places occasionally and very corrupt places.   Lucy 

Dalglish, and I’ll read the quote, director of Reporters Committee 

for Freedom of the Press, “Access litigation has dried up, 

because of what’s happened to mainstream media.”  And a 

public defender in Georgia wondered, quote, “Can underfunded 

bloggers, are they able to carry the financial burden of opening 

our courtrooms.”   And that Georgia case in fact started, or was 

based on a case that—where the Riverside Press Enterprise, went 

to court to expensively—to open the courtroom.  So, look.  This 

isn’t just domestic, and it isn’t just about the government.   

 

Seth Mydans, an old colleague of mine from Southeast Asia, said 

not too long ago, when he shows up at places in Southeast Asia, 

for stories that matter to all of us…he’s often the only reporter.  

Well we’re supposed to be the witnesses to history.  Where are 

the witnesses?  How are those witnesses going to be provided.  I 

don’t think they’ll be provided solely by tweets from people on 

the streets of Tehran.  [LAUGHTER]   An old colleague and 

mentor of mine, Max Vanzi of the Associated Press, when I went 

to the Philippines for the first time he said, here’s a clue.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 14. 

 

 

 

Nothing is ever what it seems.  And I thought, oh, that’s a lotta 

help.   But, the Hearst Corporation, and the Examiner at that 

point took care to give me five years to learn what that meant, 

and by the end of that five years I knew.  You want to talk about 

corporate greed?  Well, we’ve also talked about nonprofit models, 

the Chronicle’s been unwillingly a nonprofit… [LAUGHTER]  

newspaper for many years now.    

 

But despite that fact, because of a commitment to the kinds of 

things that I’m talking about, that are so important to us, the 

Chronicle remains in business.  So from the New York Times 

taking on Boss Tweed in the 1870s, to a young William 

Randolph Hearst supporting blue-collar workers…the public has 

been very well-served by the mainstream media,  and at a 

minimum we can’t afford to let it go, and kiss it off, because it’s 

entirely unclear what other form of journalism, support for that 

journalism, is going to be successful.  I’m under, thank you very 

much.  

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Phil Bronstein, our motion is “Good riddance to the 

mainstream media.”  And now speaking for the motion, Jim 

VandeHei, and Jim had the perfect job at a great paper, a 

respected political reporter at the Washington Post, he gave it all 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 15. 

 

 

 

up, to start a start-up news organization.  The good news is it 

turned out to be Politico.com.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jim 

VandeHei.    

JIM VANDEHEI 

[UNDER APPLAUSE]  Thank you.  I’m here to tell you that you 

not only look young, you look good too.  [LAUGHTER]  And I urge 

you to vote for the proposition because, to be blunt, I think new 

media is better than old media, and I think that we’re the hope 

for them.   I think—I agree with most of what Phil said, I agree 

that all that investment, all the accountability that old 

journalism has done, is great and that we need those values.  

But there’s also another side to mainstream media and another 

side to new media.    

 

For starters, mainstream media, for the longest time, I don’t 

think it was always as good as portrayed or always as great as 

we sort of mythicize.  And, for the longest time it was basically 

run by old white men who are left of center who are deciding 

how all of us view the news, the only diversity was how much 

hair they had left or whether they drank gin or scotch.  

[LAUGHTER]   And what new media’s done is it’s injected a ton 

of vitality and a ton of competition into the media.  And it’s also 

created, it gives you ideological, racial, and gender diversity that 

we never had before, and it gives all of us, all us news junkies, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 16. 

 

 

 

everyone in this room obviously cares a lot about news—  It gives 

us a whole new menu of information to choose from.  I also 

think, I—my background is I worked at the Wall Street Journal 

and the Washington Post and then we started Politico three years 

ago, so I think I’ve seen both sides of it.    

 

And I can tell you there’s probably a lot of businessmen and 

women in the audience because this is New York.  And I think, I 

think your stomach would be turned if you went into some 

newspapers to see how they’re run, because they had profits 

that were so high for so long, an almost like not-for-profit 

mentality took on and there became distance between the 

institutions that were covering the news and the readers.   And I 

think that, it led to a real disconnect between what institutions 

were producing and what readers wanted, and I saw this all the 

time when I was at those institutions, and when I was there 

three years ago at the Washington Post… and I include myself in 

that, I saw online, I saw the Web as a nuisance, I wanted to write 

front-page stories for a newspaper, despite the fact that I could 

look at the Web metrics and see that I was getting 10 or 20 times 

as many people reading my story online, that that’s where people 

wanted the news.    

 

And I think that creates a culture that I don’t think works for the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 17. 

 

 

 

modern news consumer.  And what new media’s done is it’s 

ripped down that wall, between the institution and the reader, 

and it’s opened up, I think it’s made it more transparent and it’s 

allowed you the reader to participate more in what we’re doing 

and even some of you to participate in the journalism that we’re 

doing.   I also want to clear up some of the myths about new 

media, because I think all the things that Phil said are really 

important and I think…you always have to remember that new 

media is in its infancy and that, it’s going to grow and it’s going 

to mature.   And you’re going to hear stuff tonight about how 

there’s a demise of serious journalism, that you know, that if you 

look online, if you look at new media it’s just not as serious and 

substantive.    

 

I’ve been in Washington for 15 years, and I would say that the 

coverage of the health care debate, has been the most 

substantive, the deepest coverage, the most accountable 

coverage that I’ve seen of a domestic policy issue in some time.   

And the best of it is coming not from the mainstream media, but 

from outside of the mainstream media.  Whether it’s Jonathan 

Cohn from The New Republic or Ezra Klein who’s doing his stuff 

sort of deep down in the WashingtonPost.com,  whether it’s 

Politico where we have three or four reporters just doing the 

policy element, we have investigative reporters doing the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 18. 

 

 

 

accountability element.  Huffington Post often has their reporters 

dispatched to this issue.  Dedicates a lot of its home page to this 

issue.    

 

You have Propublica, a not-for-profit organization run by Paul 

Steiger who I used to work with at the Wall Street Journal, and 

the Center for Public Integrity, doing some accountability 

reporting and making that available to readers throughout the 

country.   You have the Kaiser Foundation…which has stepped 

in and has started to produce non-partisan news about the 

health care debate, a lot of it about the human element of it, 

they have 20 reporters, that stuff’s available to any newspaper 

that wants to run it, so for people who care, there’s more 

information than ever, and it’s coming mostly from new media.  

You’re also going to hear about the demise of foreign coverage.  

And I think that’s a serious problem.  But we didn’t start this 

fire.  It was dying before new media ever came along, it’s really 

expensive to do foreign coverage.  And guess who is actually 

creating that bridge until we can figure out how to finance it.    

 

It’s new media.  It’s Global Post which was started by some folks 

over at the Boston Globe.  They have 65 reporters around the 

country that are doing work on a freelance basis in every corner 

of the country.  During the aftermath of the Iranian debate

which was mentioned in Phil’s column, or in Phil’s comments.   

The best coverage was often online, Huffington Post took the 

above-the-fold part of its home page, and the Huffington Post 

gets more traffic now than the Washington Post, and dedicated it 

to a running blog where you had video and text and audio 

coming in from Iran, so you could have a peek into what was 

happening on the streets that you never could’ve had in the old 

days, and I think that is a good thing.   Andrew Sullivan was 

doing a similar thing on his blog.  He had 1.2 million visitors in 

one day, which is more than you would get people reading a 

newspaper, all but the top three newspapers that are out there.  

David Wood, who is married to someone that works at Politico --  

he was a foreign policy reporter covering Afghanistan on the 

ground.   

 

Got laid off because of cutbacks at mainstream media.  Who 

hired him?  It’s American Online Politics Daily.  It’s new media 

that’s giving these people a chance to do journalism.  And I do 

believe that as new media matures, we’re going to take over that 

social responsibility of funding the expensive to do journalism, 

like accountability and like foreign policy reporting because you 

can’t cover anything if you’re not in business.  And I think that 

it’s new media that’s going to crack the code on the business 

models that actually work.   You’re also going to hear from that

side on the demise of accountability and investigative reporting.  

I think new media is leading the charge and they’re leading it by 

keeping all the mainstream media reporters employed.   

 

A lot of the best people in the business --  Bill Hamilton was Bob 

Woodward’s editor at the Washington Post, one of the best editors 

in Washington --  we, he just came over to Politico to help do our 

investigative stories and our longer form stories.   Huffington 

Post started the Investigative Fund, which is a not-for-profit arm 

that does investigative reporting.  It’s going to be run by Larry 

Roberts, who is running investigations for the Washington Post.  

Propublica, which I mentioned a little bit earlier, has thirty-three 

reporters, including Jeff Gerth from the New York Times, and 

many other people have been doing investigative reporting for a 

long time.   

 

I mentioned Talking Points Memo, and Phil was saying, Well, can 

they make money?  Is there an ability for them to finance the 

type of journalism that takes on government?  Well, I think so.  

They just got another round of funding.  They’re doubling the 

size of their staff.  They’re starting a Washington bureau and 

they’re predicting that they can get to a path to profitability.  And 

I believe that because Politico’s done it.  In year three, with a 

hundred and twenty employees, doing that type of journalism, 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

we’re profitable.  And I think it proves that this works.  So I urge 

all of you to vote for the, the resolution because new media has 

given journalism the tools, the tricks, the metabolism and the 

journalists to succeed.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

A reminder of where we are.  We are halfway through the 

opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I’m 

John Donvan of ABC News.  We have six debaters on the stage 

here, two teams of three.  And they are arguing over this motion:  

Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media.   You have heard three 

opening statements and now on to the fourth.  I’d like to 

welcome Katrina vanden Heuvel, who is editor of The Nation --  a 

small magazine with a fiercely loyal following, in many ways a 

targeted elite readership that would be the envy of many online 

websites.  However, The Nation is how old?   

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL 

A hundred and forty-four, and I feel it every day.  [LAUGHTER]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Ladies and gentlemen, Katrina vanden --    

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL  

[OVERLAP]  So you look real young.  You not only look young, 

but you look fabulous.  Okay.  [LAUGHTER]   I --  [APPLAUSE]  

Ah heh.  I never imagined that as editor and publisher of The 

Nation I’d be standing here against the resolution:  Good 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 22. 

 

 

 

Riddance to the Mainstream Media.  For a hundred and forty-

four years The Nation has challenged the limits, exposed the 

flaws of what we call the MSN.  Let me quote an old media guy, 

Antonio Gramsci:  We are witnesses to the old media order 

dying.  But a new one is not yet born.  And Jim VandeHei can 

talk about all of those examples.  But Propublica, for example, is 

very keen and explicit about partnering with what might be 

called legacy old media publications to get the big bang they 

want for their stories --  the New York Times, the Washington 

Post.  Michael Wolff, Newser basically lives off of aggregating 

mainstream media sites.  So I think to say, Good Riddance to the 

Mainstream Media may get the testosterone flowing up here, but 

it distracts from the tough work [LAUGHTER]  of salvaging and 

reviving quality journalism in newsrooms that will hold 

accountable the powerful.    

 

So I’m ready to separate my frustration with the many 

weaknesses of the mainstream media from a recognition of the 

valuable role it plays.  And I would, you know, suggest to anyone 

to go back and look, not just twenty years ago, but at the last 

two years of the Pulitzer prizes or the Hellman Media Award, 

which I am on, and look at who is winning awards to reform, 

correct, shame, expose --  and it’s still largely the mainstream 

media.  I’m not going to speak in ways I was going to about my 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 23. 

 

 

 

frustration with the mainstream media.  You can imagine it, 

from the run-up to last year’s financial meltdown and most 

centrally, the Iraq war.  So many mainstream media outlets have 

operated as stenographers to power, not as tough, hardheaded 

reporters.  [APPLAUSE]  And this is a real problem, but this is 

not about throwing out the baby with the bath water.   

 

It’s not defending the indefensible.  It is about talking about, yes, 

the capacity of institutions for the health of our democracy.  And 

for someone to say, Oh, it’s just the commonweal and you’re 

going to hear about people who want to protect the health of our 

democracy, I consider quality, independent reporting a public 

good.  And for all the frustration the mainstream media has 

caused us, we can’t live without it until we have some idea of 

what’s going to replace it.  And I would argue right now, nobody 

has a clear idea.  The fact is that nobody but institutions like the 

New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, 

excluding the nutty editorial pages, and a small group of regional 

papers do most of the reporting in this country that the rest of 

us depend on to try to hold power accountable.  And yeah, there 

are mistakes.  But it’s the hardworking reporter, whether in 

Congress, the federal bureaucracy.  You talked about Ezra Klein, 

Jim.  Fair enough, he’s done some great work on the health care.  

He’s at the Washington Post.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 24. 

 

 

 

 

State houses, City Hall are on the warfronts, which, you know, 

unfortunately, we’re in a number of them.  That is the expensive 

legwork, drudge work that allows our system to operate with 

even a dose of accountability.  And that is expensive.  So, for all 

their flaws, think about what newspapers --  and not just 

newspapers --  have done to provide a check on corruption and 

crooked politicians.  Think about not only what my partner, Phil, 

spoke about --  journalists as not only witnesses to history but 

witnesses to oppression, journalistic enterprises keeping people 

safe, the most vulnerable from torture, oppression, injustice.  

People do awful things to each other but it’s worse in places 

where everybody is kept in the dark.  Twitter isn’t going to feed 

that right now.  It is building their other sources --  Global Post, 

one of the better for-profit models.  

 

But the capacity is not there yet.  At the local level there are 

reports which correlate a measurable decline in the quality of 

local democracy with the demise of local papers.  So if the 

current journalistic model is unsustainable --  and you may 

think it is --  it’s up to those in our society who care about the 

continued ability to function as a democracy to find ways to fund 

reporting and insure the dissemination of quality journalism and 

information.  This is a transformational moment.  You’re going to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 25. 

 

 

 

hear from the other side.  In crisis is opportunity.  But it’s not a 

moment to toss out what has value, despite the flaws.  There is a 

journalistic eco-system emerging out there but it is still very 

fragile.  And to make the divide between old and new media into 

something, I would argue, artificially inflated by the other side, is 

to pit against each other what should be evolving together for the 

benefit of our country.    

 

So the fundamental problem remains.  Without powerful media 

institutions to take on the powerful on behalf of the rest of us we 

become more vulnerable as a society to those who would use 

their influence for private gain, damn the public consequences.   

We need a plan B and we don’t have one yet --  which, come to 

think of it, reminds me of how the Bush Administration went 

into Iraq and we all know how that turned out.  [AUDIENCE 

RESPONSE, APPLAUSE]  Thank you.    

JOHN DONVAN   

Our next debater, who will be speaking for the motion:  Good 

Riddance to the Mainstream Media, John Hockenberry, has 

been, I would say, an old colleague of mine who has dabbled in 

the mainstream media, working at both NBC and ABC.  But his 

career has really been built around experimentation.  I wager he 

is the only person in the hall who has written, produced and 

acted in a one-man show off-Broadway.  He’s been breaking the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 26. 

 

 

 

rules a long time.  He is currently the host of public radio 

morning news program, The Takeaway.  Ladies and gentlemen, 

John Hockenberry.  [APPLAUSE]   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY 

 [OVERLAP]  Thank you.  And thank you, Katrina.  I would say 

that new media has a lot to learn from The Nation, which most 

these days resembles a blog, more than anything else in the 

mainstream media.  And I think we owe The Nation a debt.  But 

speaking directly to people is nothing new.  And the idea that 

our opponents would have us believe that somehow freedom of 

the press and the accountability of the media to hold institutions 

accountable and to keep them honest --  is somehow created by 

this for-profit structure that my colleague Michael describes 

compellingly is dead and that my colleague Jim describes is alive 

and well, at least in terms of its voice and its passion for 

accountability in the new media is at odds with what the 

Constitution is about.   

 

The first amendment enabled the mainstream media and what 

have they done with the custodianship of this authority and this 

sense of holding us all accountable in this democracy and in 

doing the quality reporting that we so value?  What have they 

done?  What are we defending here?  In September, The Beatles 

Rock Band Project was, a product,was unveiled.  And it was 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 27. 

 

 

 

extraordinarily successful and it was a profound argument to 

those in the corporate for-profit media in the music business 

that said somehow the means of distribution being freed from 

the record companies to people who actually play and use music 

was going to destroy music in some sense:  that if the record 

business went away somehow music would be affected, that 

somehow the art form of music and the quality of music would 

be affected.   

 

What instead happened was people bought Beatles Rock Band 

because they wanted the music.  They also wanted the 

experience of being in the band.  They wanted to part of the 

music itself.  The technology enabled people suddenly to be a 

part of something that they were not permitted to be a part of.  

Why?  Because the for-profit structure of mainstream media 

prevented them.  It’s an old story in America.  When the means 

of distribution goes out of the hands of the small set of 

individuals and individual institutions that control it, change is 

afoot.   This is a moment we should embrace.  All of the 

institutions described by our opponents were created in times of 

similar transformation.  The Hearst era, the New York Times, the 

tabloid era in American history which formed the basis of the 

American Revolution were all transformational moments when 

mainstream media was going away and new media was coming 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 28. 

 

 

 

in.    

 

This is a moment to celebrate.  Good Riddance to the 

Mainstream Media --  it should be written in the Constitution.  

[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  What are they trying to preserve here?  

John Donvan says that I dabbled in the mainstream media.  No, 

no, no --  I was handcuffed to the wall of the mainstream media, 

ladies and gentlemen.  [LAUGHTER]  Are we preserving the office 

culture and mentality at a television network where the senior 

editor of a news program holds an office poll to bet on the ratings 

for next morning’s program --  that culture?   The obsession with 

the ages of the audience, as many jokes have been made here 

tonight --  this is something for the mainstream media.  Chasing 

eyeballs, commodifying eyeballs --  that’s the business.  At the 

height of the war in Iraq, that Katrina suggests President Bush 

led us into, the number one news broadcast reporting on that 

war was owned by a defense contractor.   

 

Is that what we’re preserving here?  Is there not a conflict of 

interest in that situation?  Do we want to perpetuate that?  Are 

we saying that the mainstream media, which has so humored 

these wonderful journalists who get paid not as much as the 

executives at the for-profit media, but we want to have them 

around because they hold the media accountable.  They hold the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 29. 

 

 

 

government accountable.  This is a disservice, number one, to 

the first amendment.  It’s a disservice to journalism.  My first job 

as a journalist was a volunteer.  Now, I’m not saying that I would 

give up all of my income at this stage in my life, but the best 

journalists are people who don’t do it for the money.  We want to 

create institutions that are all about doing it for the money and 

then we expect that the values of journalism and reporting are 

going to be maintained in that structure?   

 

And then when it changes and institutions like my colleague Jim 

describes, Politico.com --  where that I will do journalism 

whether I’m paid or not kind of passion comes into play --  we’re 

going to say, Oh, my gosh, what’s happening?  We’re throwing 

out the baby with the bath water.  There’s something wrong 

here.  We’ve gotta stop this.  No, this is how it works.  We do not 

look to the mainstream media to preserve the first amendment.  

[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]  We look to the first amendment to 

preserve the voices of the people --  on Twitter who are holding 

the people accountable:  on Facebook, on social media, in blogs -

-  who are creating media and publishing media on their own. 

When the means of distribution leaves the hands of the few the 

many benefit.  Now, are we to judge the success of this 

transformation by who is making money or not?  Is that 

consistent with the values of we want to hold the government 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 30. 

 

 

 

accountable?    

 

We want journalism to be the Fifth Estate.  This is the 

mechanisms of democracy.  If our gauge for the health of the 

media is whether some folks are making money then we’ve given 

up at the beginning.  We basically conceded the debate and I 

won’t concede the debate.  Good Riddance to the Mainstream 

Media.  They had custodianship of this sense of authority for 

quite a while.  And what did they bring us?  Two words:  balloon 

boy.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  Iraq.  [CHEERS]    

JOHN DONVAN   

Finally, to debate against the motion:  Good Riddance to the 

Mainstream Media --  David Carr, who is a media columnist and 

reporter for the New York Times  and also frequently capable of 

getting off a good line or two.  His take on the situation we’re in 

now, a column from last September, he said:  Clearly, for the 

mainstream media the sky is falling.  The question is whether 

anyone will be left to cover it.  Ladies and gentlemen, David Carr.  

[APPLAUSE]   

DAVID CARR 

Thank you, John.  Thank you, John Hockenberry.  I’ve had time 

to sit there for a little bit and really do some study on the 

audience and I want to co-sign, young, good looking, fabulous 

and I’m thinking, hot.  [LAUGHTER]  It just came to me while I 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

was looking.  Do I mention that because I want you to vote 

against this proposition, which is a per se dumb idea?  Why?  

Number one:  I should mention it’s how I get hamburgers for my 

family so there is a small bit of self-interest.  But number two:  

these are really smart lawyers over here, but we got good facts.  

And the fact is, as opposed to what?  You want us to take the 

weight off Balloon Boy.  Balloon Boy was a trending topic on 

Twitter for four days straight.  It’s all Twitter could talk about.   

 

They weren’t talking about the elections in Iraq, the elections in 

Afghanistan that have gone wrong.  They weren’t talking about 

the bombings in Iraq.  They were talking about John and Kate.  

Twitter, I love Twitter.  I’m on there every damn day.  But, but 

the best links in Twitter are always, always into the data stream 

of mainstream media.  Because I work at the New York Times I’m 

cast here as the dad in the basement at the teen party.  Cool 

guys over there, [LAUGHTER]  but us old fuddy-duddies.  Well, I 

work at the New York Times.  We have seventeen million people 

that come to our website.  We put out a hundred videos every 

month.  We have eighty blogs.  We are fully engaged in the 

revolution that John talks about and we are at the vanguard, as 

is the Washington Post, as is the Wall Street Journal.  To suggest 

that somehow, a hand created citizen media is going to support--

for instance, the New York Times has a news budget of two 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 32. 

 

 

 

hundred and twenty million dollars, dozens of bureaus all over 

the world, many other news organizations, the same footprint.    

 

And we’re going to toss that out, which is the proposition --  toss 

that out and kick back and see what Facebook turns up.  

[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  I don’t think so.  Look, we’re gathered 

here around a bonfire and I stipulate to the business problems 

of the media.  Larger national newspapers, some of them are 

doing pretty well.  Small community papers are doing great.  

Michael wants you to think that it’s five large media companies.  

It’s hundreds and hundreds of newspapers, local stations 

representing thousands and thousands of reporters who are 

bringing accountability to their community every day.  I live in 

New Jersey, which is a petri dish, a game preserve of corruption.  

[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  The last time that they came out to get 

the bad guys in government it took three busses.  Do we need 

fewer reporters?  [LAUGHTER]  Do we need less accountability?  

The next time they’re going to need a choo-choo train, to 

[INAUDIBLE, LAUGHTER].  There is, there is a delight in dancing 

around the bonfire, there’s a delight, in grave-dancing, I’m not a 

grave-dancer, you shouldn’t be either, you should vote against 

this proposition.    

 

The hybrid model that Katrina talked about, where old and new 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 33. 

 

 

 

media gradually developed ways of dealing with the business 

challenges of supporting independent accountability reporting, is 

what’s real.  That’s what is true.   It feels great to throw out the 

babies and stare into the bathwater so let’s go ahead and throw 

out a few.  Okay, there goes Glenn Beck…  [LAUGHTER]  There 

goes Keith Olbermann.  It felt great.  They’re gone.  [LAUGHTER]   

And it’s true that newspapers and broadcasters have used their 

monopoly powers to make millions but they’ve funded reporting 

over and above what the culture ever had.  Michael suggested 

the business is only 20 years old.    

 

Paper I work at has been around for 150 years…  I think that  

part of the reason that people get riled up is it’s easy to dwell on 

the barnacles, but what would you really know about Walter 

Reade, what would you really know about Katrina, what would 

you really know about 9/11.   A million bloggers, typing a billion 

posts, I don’t think could get you to the place you need to be as 

a citizen to make important decisions, I consume new media, I 

believe in new media, I love Politico, it’s a great brand build-up.   

But unless you got a millionaire that’s going to absorb a lotta 

losses to get things going—  The shop I work for occasionally 

makes money.  None of those guys can say that.  Okay.  The 

model that they’re selling you has not demonstrated a business 

efficacy.   And so, when Jim himself described it as an industry 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 34. 

 

 

 

that’s in its infancy, are we to take the old, and throw it away, 

and grab a nascent industry that’s done a world of good, but in 

very small numbers.  Global Post which has been brought up.   

 

They’re paying reporters hundreds of dollars, who are there 

because legacy media assets put them out there, to train them 

out there.  All of these new media enterprises, many of them, are 

staffed with legacy assets from old media and once those assets 

peter out they’re going to have to figure out a way to make 

money.   I mean, I get it, I’m here from the New York Times and 

I’ve received my orders from the dark overlords of the 

mainstream media.  [LAUGHTER]  They put a chip in, I gotta tell 

you it hurts a little bit.  [LAUGHTER]   And they also told me, if 

you fail tonight, do not come back to headquarters.  

[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  So keep that in mind.  Look—  

[LAUGHTER]  It’s fun to build a bonfire, it’s not much fun to 

figure out what you’re going to replace it with.   All the plucky 

citizens in the world, all the networked intelligence that you can 

come up with, are not going to give us what we need.  Which is 

real-time data as citizens on a variety of platforms from a variety 

of voices, to make an informed choice every time we step outside 

that door.  Vote against this proposal.   

[APPLAUSE]

JOHN DONVAN  

[UNDER APPLAUSE]  And that concludes Round 1 of this 

Intelligence Squared debate where the motion is, “Good riddance 

to the mainstream media.”  And I’ve now received the results of 

the preliminary vote, just to remind you and to remind listeners 

and viewers, our live audience voted before the debate began, 

their positions on our motion, “Good riddance to the mainstream 

media.”  They will vote again at the end of the debate and the 

team that changes the most minds over the course of the debate 

will be declared our winner.    

 

Here are the preliminary results.  Before the debate 25 percent 

were for the motion, 50 percent against the motion, and 25 

percent undecided.  That is where things started, you will vote 

again at the conclusion to pick our winner.   Now we’re—now 

we’re moving on to Round 2, this is our middle round in which 

the debaters address each other directly, and we will also take 

questions from you in the audience.  And as you ponder your 

questions I’ll once again ask you to think in terms of real 

questions and to think in terms of something that’s very brief, 

and if you have to write it on a piece of paper it’s probably not 

what you want to do.   Something that is spontaneous, fresh, 

and real, will always work best.  But I would like to ask a 

question of the side that is arguing against the motion, Katrina, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 36. 

 

 

 

you said that there is no Plan B, but what I heard from the other 

side sounded like, Plan C, D, E, F, G, all the way through Z,  

what— why do you feel that the argument particularly that Jim 

VandeHei made that there are plenty of already evident… forms 

of real, legitimate replacement, good journalism happening, why 

don’t you take those seriously as actually stepping up and filling 

the gap that you say is absent without a Plan B.    

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL 

You know, I spent the last year or so going to many conferences 

about the future of journalism, the crisis of journalism, just last 

week there was a big report on the reconstruction of American 

journalism, I’ve read all of Michael Massing’s pieces in the New 

York Review of Books.   There are many models.  There are many 

models, and I think—believe I was arguing for a hybrid.  I don’t 

think we throw out what has strong elements, that have worked, 

for—I want to pick up on John Hockenberry’s points, about NBC 

owning a defense contractor, one of the first centerfolds, the 

only…first centerfold The Nation ever did was on the national 

entertainment state in 1996 where we tracked five octopi.   And 

the news operations were little cogs in these enterprises.  And 

many of these are newspapers but there are strong MSM 

operations, which have a capacity, which Phil spoke to for 

example, on access, Freedom of Information.   On sending 

journalists around the world, sending journalists around this

country, and funding them.  Nonprofit funding of journalism was 

about $128 million between 2005 into 2009.  That’s one major 

newsroom.   Their for-profit models are very small at the 

moment, and I think all of these foundations and all of the 

people looking at new models, want to build on elements of the 

MSM, I spoke of ProPublica.  A group in Washington founded by 

David Bennahum.  The Independent.  He monitors the impact of 

his website, by how his stories, his reporters get picked up in the 

mainstream media—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Go to Michael Wolff, what do you make of that, it’s basically an 

argument that somebody will step up and reach into his own 

pockets and pay for it.

MICHAEL WOLFF  

Well, but you’re supported by a foundation, I don’t know about 

what—how much comes from your pocket or your family’s 

pocket but you’re really not talking about the media business, 

you’re not talking about journalism, you’re talking about a 

philanthropy, which is great, and that’s another conversation

that we might have, but if you’re talking about a robust, self-

supporting, profit-making, entrepreneurial, live, real, continuing 

reason for being business, that’s something different.   Now in 

your—everything you’ve said is incredibly noble, and it’s good, I 

wish it would happen, but it’s not the media business.  And 

maybe you’re not a part of the media business which I would 

argue that you’re not.  That you do something else.   But the 

proposition is about the media business.  It’s the mainstream 

media is actually at various times, it’s been the biggest business 

in this country.  And you’re talking about something that is you 

know, worthy but not really, the discussion—    

JOHN DONVAN  

Phil Bronstein I see getting ready to respond?   

PHIL BRONSTEIN 

Well first of all I mean I think that it’s really, the issue is 

not…what do we think of Plans B through Z.  I think we might 

all agree that there are interesting plans in there somewhere in 

that alphabet soup.  The proposition here is getting rid of A.  Not 

the plans B through Z.   And I think John Hockenberry created a 

bit of a false case, money case.  The issue really isn’t about, are 

these capitalist organizations.  Evil capitalist organizations.  

They must make money and they go against the grain of the 

great passion of journalism.   Believe me, to be at a newspaper 

these days you have to be passionate because, you’re like the

guy in the L’il Abner cartoon with the cloud over his head all the 

time.  The point I tried to—I wanted to make about money was, 

that you needed to be able to sustain that kinda journalism,  

Propublica has a three-year, $10 million-a-year grant essentially 

from a single family.  Is that going to continue?  What happens if 

Propublica writes about that family—   

JOHN DONVAN 

But Phil, Phil, John’s argument—   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY 

Look, wait, wait a minute—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—John also made the argument—   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY 

—here, here’s the problem, here’s the problem with that.  I 

mean, okay, there’s a lot of moaning and handwringing about 

what’s going away and it—that somehow new media is ending 

the old media, well no, we’re in a transformational moment, 

things are ending and other things are beginning.   Where you 

don’t go, and this is surprising to me.  Are you arguing for an 

explicit protected subsidy of these media divisions, of these news 

divisions of these organizations where, somehow in the federal 

tax code they’re going to be permitted some status, some subsidy 

that’s going to allow them to survive because we’ve decided, that 

it’s constitutionally important to maintain these businesses?

also forgetting to know, to note, is that it’s early, we’re all trying 

to figure out the business model, we haven’t even started to 

charge for content.   Trust me, people, you’re going to be paying 

for content [LAUGHTER], a lot of it is going to be new media 

content, and I think the whole argument over here is, we’re not 

saying get rid of mainstream media altogether, we’re saying, get 

rid of it, get rid of it the way you’ve been!  [LAUGHTER]   The 

reason you guys are arguing that you survive or that people 

should vote with you is that by adopting all of our techniques, by 

get—the speed, the transparency, the openness, the Twitter, all 

of the things that are thriving in new media, that’s—we’re 

equipping some of the mainstream media institutions, to have at 

least a chance of survival and there aren’t that many—

that your institution should be maintained as they are now, or 

are you simply saying, I want to know I have a job when the New 

York Times goes under.  I mean is that the argument.  

[LAUGHTER]   Because the latter one I’m not interested in.  The 

former one I am interested in, of course there are things about 

the New York Times, and there are qualities of the mainstream 

media that we want preserved.  They aren’t the core of those 

businesses—   

DAVID CARR  

Well, the—

—and the strategy for making those businesses profitable is not 

to do more of that, as we’ve amply demonstrated, they do less of 

that now—   

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL

we are against “Good riddance to the mainstream”—

the type of journalism, about the ways that we can use 

technology to make journalism a lot more accessible to all of 

you, to give all of you guys input into—to journalism, and I think 

it’s a much better thing, like I hate the pessimism that I see, in 

the mainstream media about what’s happening,  this is a great 

time, it’s a great time if you want to be a journalist, it’s a great 

time if you’re a news consumer, because there’s more 

information than you could’ve ever asked for, and a lot of it is 

coming from where?  From us, not from them—

JOHN DONVAN 

Phil Bronstein.    

JOHN HOCKENBERRY  

Let me just say here is how—  [APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN 

John, John, John, let me just get to the other side, Phil 

Bronstein, please.    

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

Well I hate the pessimism too.  But John Hockenberry, John 

made a very eloquent case about the First Amendment a few 

minutes ago, and he and I were together earlier today and I 

mentioned the Balco case, or, the problems that came up in the 

Balco case with the government, and he said well, at least we 

have the First Amendment, or we have the First Amendment, 

something to that effect.   And the reality is the First Amendment 

did not help us when Alberto Gonzalez was the Attorney General.  

The First Amendment did not help us as that administration, the 

previous administration went Circuit Court by Federal Circuit 

Court, to take away the rights of reporters to maintain the 

confidentiality of their sources and do their job.   The First 

Amendment didn’t mean anything in that circumstance.  And so, 

we’re all great believers in the First Amendment, I would 

assume.  But it really required years of hard work, years of 

struggle, and millions and millions of dollars, for newspapers 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

whether it’s the San Francisco Chronicle or the New York Times or 

the Washington Post, or the Riverside Press Enterprise, to make 

sure that the government was held accountable, to the notion of 

the First Amendment, that there was a First Amendment and 

that there would be people fighting for it.   So, I think that was a 

false sort of argument to make about the First Amendment, I 

think the argument is very different—   

JOHN DONVAN 

John Hockenberry, you want to come back on this—   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY  

Sadly you used the worst case for endorsing the mainstream 

media.  The war was endorsed by the mainstream media in the 

United States, the war in Iraq was the worst moment of the 

mainstream media in the United States, similar to the—   

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

[UNCLEAR]—   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY  

Alberto Gonzales period.  These were aspects of the Bush 

administration that were not questioned by the mainstream 

media, it was only much, much later, that the media stepped in 

and questioned those points.   

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

Alberto Gonzalez—

JOHN HOCKENBERRY 

And indeed—  

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

—[UNCLEAR]—   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY 

—the mainstream media apologized for its endorsement of both 

the war and some of the tactics of the Bush administration, long 

after the fact.   The idea that you were on the front lines of being 

accountable to the government run amok under the Bush 

administration, is just completely at odds with the facts—   

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

So to maintain mainstream media you would like us to be 

perfect.

this case because I do think, the reporting around the corruption 

of the Karzai government and the run-off, contributed in some 

measure to a public waking up and the fact that a majority of 

Americans now oppose this war,  and if I could, in between…the 

Iraq war and Afghanistan, or at a certain point around Iraq, how

the things I’m, I do this a lot, I go around the country and I talk 

about the end of newspapers and one of the things that 

invariably comes up, let’s see if it comes up here is the Boston 

Globe and its investigation of abuses in the Catholic church, and 

everybody goes well, what would happen with that.   And I 

thought about this for a long time and I—then I thought…well, 

where was the Boston Globe for the 30 years this was going on?

But we know too late, nobody, nobody should get an award here.

The main—right, there we go.  [APPLAUSE]  I know my

business model, that has a mixed record on the kinds of virtues 

that David Carr is talking about.   That is now going down the 

tubes for reasons that have to do with an economic 

transformation that is both productive and useful, and the idea 

of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater, that there is no 

alternative, Jim amply demonstrates that the alternative is 

emerging.  If it’s with partnerships with the mainstream media

Yes, of course, thank you, I do work for a public radio station in 

Washington D.C.  I cut my teeth on investigative journalism.  I’m 

not quite so sure I really care about the delivery system, whether 

it’s a blog, a newspaper, a television story.   Of all the models 

we’ve talked about tonight, I’d like to hear the panelists debate 

the best delivery system for really deep investigative journalism,

pockets, John Hockenberry, to do exactly what that questioner is 

asking about, the very deep kind of journalism.  And you 

actually argued the opposite, that having deep pockets leads to 

terrible conflicts of interest.  Take that question.   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY  

Well I would say that the deep pockets that supported one 

investigative series, which I applaud, was also used for other 

purposes, for the other 364 days of the year, so, the deep 

pockets are used for various things at various times.  You—if 

you exist under the illusion that the deep pockets merely 

support investigative journalism, then you’re really supporting 

our point here.   Obviously we support and endorse the virtues

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 61. 

 

 

 

of investigative journalism that holds institutions to account.  

But to say that the only delivery system for that is newspapers 

financed by shareholders in a corporate model, is to really ignore 

the present moment.  I think newspapers do a great job.  I think 

Politico.com does a great job.  I think any one individual 

platform is not the model.  And I think what we’re talking about 

here is a proliferation of platforms being a good thing, a 

transformational moment.   And if it makes some very, very well-

paid people in the mainstream media worried, then, you know, 

that’s the kind of worry that we journalists cut our teeth on it 

seems to me.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Phil Bronstein?   

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

Yeah, and we’ve heard a lot from our opponents tonight about, 

“You will hear from the other side,” and we really, you haven’t 

heard a lotta those things that they say you’ll hear from us.  And 

I mean first of all, John Hockenberry just said a minute ago, if 

we could roll back the tape-- I’d suggest we do it.  If it’s in 

partnership with mainstream media, so be it, meaning the 

future.  Well, there goes their side of the argument.  

[LAUGHTER]  Because, if mainstream media is good riddanced, 

then there’s no partnership with mainstream media to be had.  I 

don’t know what the other purposes John was talking about, the

364 days a year, it sounds like, you know, we’re cutting people’s 

shoes off those other…the rest of the year.   But I don’t believe, I 

mean —the quote when I went up to the podium was, you know, 

you said to your newsroom, the business model’s broken and no 

one knows how to fix it yet, so…I’m not making the case for the 

business model, and I am not making the case that that top-

down, vertical kind of mass medium is really the only model.   I 

don’t know that you’ve heard anyone from this side say it’s the 

only model which is the phrase that John just used.

Let’s respect our audience member.  Sir.   

MAN IN AUDIENCE 

Thank you first of all to all the panelists, we’ve heard a lot about 

what is purportedly wrong with mainstream media.  I’d like to 

hear a little bit about what might be wrong with new media, and 

also some comment on the recent calls from the regulators on 

regulating new media,  bloggers and so forth disclosing what 

they receive from corporations, and how the new media, this 

nascent institution if you will, might evolve and what we need to 

watch out for if anything.    

JOHN DONVAN 

That was a question.  [APPLAUSE]  Yes.  Katrina, would you like 

to take it?   

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL  

I’m—yeah, you can [UNCLEAR]—   

DAVID CARR  

Uh…  

JOHN DONVAN 

David Carr—   

DAVID CARR  

Part of the problem that goes on on the Web, and there are so 

many wonderful examples of brand build-out on the Web, the 

Huffington Post, I’ve never encountered anything like it in my

media career, watched something explode like that.  Jim’s ability 

to take reporters who have worked elsewhere and just start 

breaking stories right away, has just been breathtaking to watch 

as a media reporter.   That’s the exception, not the rule.  Out on 

the Web, people assemble into verticals of self-interest.  They 

often speak only to each other.  They become an echo chamber 

of half-truths, sometimes outright lies, without any real data 

points coming in.   And so you end up with a sort of mass of 

people talking to each other, no one has read anything.  No one 

knows anything.  They’re talking about something that someone 

else read that read that read that read.  And we end up in a 

meta-world.   The people that I follow on Twitter always include a 

link to what they’re talking about.  The blogs that I follow, and 

Politico is a great example of this, live in the ecosystem of blogs, 

so you have transparency to what they’re talking and why they’re 

talking about it.   You can look into the database.  But there isn’t 

a lot of it going on.  As these guys have said themselves, it’s a 

very nascent state.  In the mainstream media, and the 

blogosphere, are—we’ve adopted the tools of the insurgency in 

terms of presentation, going to the Web, or Afghanistan reporting 

as video, as maps, where the drug lords are, blogs in real time of 

what’s going on.  At the same time, you have new media 

adopting standards, reporting, approaches, starting to beef up.  I 

think the two are coming together.

JOHN DONVAN 

Jim VandeHei, sounds like again you’re agreeing—   

JIM VANDEHEI  

Well we just—we keep hearing about that, you were just talking 

a little bit about the echo chamber like it’s just noise and people 

are amplifying positions that they already have and there’s a lot 

of misinformation out there.  But who’s doing the fact-checking, 

some of the best fact-checking’s being done by new media.  

Factcheck.org, which I think is the name of the arm of the St. 

Petersburg Times which won a Pulitzer Prize for its fact-

checking—that online, that new media component made the old 

media relevant, who’s been fact-checking, who was quickest to 

fact-check the death panels and all the other nonsense that 

we’ve had in different debates in recent months.    

 

It’s websites like ours, it’s the Huffington Post.  It’s various 

bloggers who are checking this stuff in real time, and they’re 

setting the record straight, and I think that that’s a fabulous, 

advance.  Is there a bigger burden on you as the reader right 

now than there was, 10 years ago, when five people at the three 

big networks and the two big newspapers told you how to view 

world events?  Yes.  But I think there’s so much more 

information now for you to consume, thanks to new media, that 

you’re a much more educated consumer of news and you can

make probably a much, a better decision based on the facts.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Right, there was a second part to that question about regulation 

of the new media, and I’m sure you’re against it.  So I’m going 

to—

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

I’m the—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Oh, I’m sorry, I actually was going to the gentleman behind you, 

and I’ll come back to you, ma’am.    

MAN IN AUDIENCE 

As a consumer I—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Can you stand, please?   

MAN IN AUDIENCE 

Yeah, as a consumer I think one of the values that I see in 

mainstream media is comprehension of coverage where you can 

look at a source, and really understand what’s going on in the 

world.   And I worry that socially, how does media, if that goes 

away and there’s not funding for that breadth of coverage, what’s 

the social impact of that, if we all move to new media, certain 

verticals where people just choose…to read what they want to 

read and they’re not exposed to all these other things.    

JOHN DONVAN  

John Hockenberry, why don’t you take that.   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY  

Well, again, I think what is the argument there, do we preserve 

an institution and do we choose which newspapers are worthy of 

having this subsidy to maintain their position?   And then are we 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 68. 

 

 

 

to call them independent?  Are we to say that because now they 

are supported by the government, they’re supported by some 

sort of tax on say, television or Internet service providers that 

that revenue now flowing to those institutions makes them 

secure and independent in some sense that’s going to make the 

journalism better?   No, I think what you’ve done there is create 

a jobs program for some great journalists and, let’s hope they 

stick around.  But if they leave, there’s absolutely no guarantee 

that the virtues that you talk about that are associated with the 

brand of those institutions, is going to remain.  What— the only 

thing—   

JOHN DONVAN  

But John, do you—do you agree with the premise of the question 

that, that the new media tends toward people…seeking out views 

that they know they already agree with?   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY  

But I think the mainstream media is at least as guilty of that as 

anything in the blogsphere, I mean it is the Fox News Network I 

believe that created a theme park out of a conspiracy of liberals 

taking over the world.  And—  [LAUGHTER]  And so I think that 

model has worked for newspapers, as well as it’s worked for 

blogs, it’s certainly nothing that was invented by the Huffington 

Post.

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL 

I’m just—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Katrina—   

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL 

 —I’m thinking of a news story in the Las Vegas Sun, which was a 

six-month project by a paper which wasn’t that well-funded but, 

part of the mainstream media, may have been a chain.   And it 

was a journalist who covered what unaccountable officials had 

not covered, what the labor unions had averted their eyes to.  

And she uncovered…deaths.  Accidental deaths of about 30 

workers.   And what she did with her reporting over a sustained 

period of time, and I think it would’ve been difficult to do though 

I’m all over many platforms, and I’m for hybrid.  But people 

aren’t reading sustained, comprehensive series, on the Web, in a 

new media way.  And what she did was save lives.  And I think 

that is—   

JOHN DONVAN   

But why couldn’t the Web very quickly adapt to that sort of 

model?    

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL 

Well, I think, that, in a different instance— I mean again a 

sustained series over the course of a year, by Nina Bernstein of 

the New York Times, she not only had her newspaper behind her 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

in filing FOIA’s which lawyers didn’t have the funding to do, this 

is on immigration detention.  SoI think, she had the support of 

the funding, which is difficult in these untested models of new 

media…   Even ProPublica as I said earlier, wants to get its 

stories in what you would consider the mainstream media, high-

quality investigative journalism that exposes wrongs, corrects 

and reforms.  I think the new media, and I don’t want to sound 

retro because I think we want a hybrid, we want a healthy 

journalism.   But I think it’s tougher to do those kinds of things 

now, on the Web.  People are doing Politico, they’re doing quick 

takes, they’re doing quick stories.  But it’s rare to find people 

who are reading long investigative series…   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, the questioner I asked—   

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL 

—on the Web—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—to wait before, ma’am—?   

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL 

 —and it doesn’t have the impact in some way, I’m sorry, because 

of the institutional authority,  historically, which may change 

and is changing slowly, but not yet, of a New York Times taking 

on a scandal, and pushing for reform which in my view is what 

public interest-watchdog-accountability journalism is about.

JOHN DONVAN  

Ma’am, your question.   

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

Yeah, I’m the general counsel of the Hearst Corporation and 20 

minutes ago the Houston Chronicle sued the governor of Texas 

for failing to turn over a clemency report, which a source told us 

contained information that the person they killed today was 

innocent.   My question to you all is, how many lawsuits are you 

aware of that, let’s call it new media, has brought on behalf of 

the public interest for important information.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jim VandeHei.    

JIM VANDEHEI  

We applaud what the Houston paper is doing, we applaud what 

the Las Vegas paper is doing, but I think when you decide that 

you’re going to vote for the proposition, one of the things you 

have to keep in mind is that it is a false argument to say that 

this cannot and will not be done by the new media.   You were 

talking about how you recall the— this Las Vegas series.  I recall 

Talking Points Memo doing a series of pieces on the series of 

firings of US Attorneys under Bush and was relentless in doing 

it, and was—and did a great job of using the technology that new 

media’s created, to be able to get more documents, get more 

information and over time, build up a story that forced other

people to reckon with and, and got attention and made a 

difference and I think increasingly—   

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

You used a lotta stories from local papers.    

JIM VANDEHEI  

Increasingly—  

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

And aggregators—   

JIM VANDEHEI  

And using a lot of like, the information that’s coming in 

[UNCLEAR]—   

MICHAEL WOLFF  

And you have files in your offices at the Chronicle as well, where 

you clip newspapers from other sources.  And you use that as 

part of your research to develop stories, for heaven’s sakes—   

PHIL BRONSTEIN  

Right, but I wouldn’t then want to go kill those other sources.

off of Death Row and helped the governor change the policy.   

This week, new case, prosecutors sensing an opportunity, 

doesn’t address the issue of whether the person they brought 

forth is guilty or innocent, says I want your notes.  I want your 

emails.  I want all of your reporting materials to prove, whether 

you got a better grade or not if you got this guy off.   Again and 

again…you need large, powerful institutions, barnacles attached, 

to take on large, powerful government forces—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Michael Wolff—   

DAVID CARR  

—there’s no way around it.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Michael Wolff.    

MICHAEL WOLFF  

Just briefly and I think it’s worth pointing out and this is 

something that people up here are loath to say and people don’t 

like to say in a, you know, among a polite group here, but, and I 

like the people at the Hearst Company.  But you put out terrible 

newspapers and you’ve put out terrible newspapers for at least 

half a century, so, the question is should we fight to preserve 

Hearst newspapers and again I love the people at Hearst and you 

put out some good magazines, et cetera, et cetera.  But I don’t 

think anyone wants to make the case for Hearst newspapers—

—or for any—

Do you—    

MICHAEL WOLFF  

—of the chain newspapers—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Do you feel, ma’am, that your question was answered?    

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

No, I was looking for a numeric answer to the question—   

JOHN DONVAN 

I’m sorry, repeat—   

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

I was looking for a numeric answer to the question, how many 

lawsuits have you brought in the public interest as part of 

original reporting, rather than the barnacle… pieces that you 

use, I’m not criticizing it but just curious as to whether or not 

you’ve put any energy into that.    

JOHN HOCKENBERRY  

Look, we stipulate that new media does not have the track 

record that the New York Times or the Houston Chronicle has 

because it is new media.  And, and indeed, if the metric is, what 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 75. 

 

 

 

have you done for me over the last century, then new media will 

lose.  [LAUGHTER]   But what we are talking about is, what have 

you done for me lately.  [LAUGHTER]  And I think the question is 

that over time, mainstream media will have less ability to do 

what Katrina and David and Phil are talking about,  and new 

media will have more capacity to do it, and the intent is 

absolutely there, and the panel has not demonstrated that, for 

some reason, new media has no interest in the kinds of things 

you’re talking about it, take Katrina’s thing for just one moment.   

She’s describing how a woman reporter worked for six months 

on a story that saved lives, and that’s getting more difficult now.  

I mean, imagine, at a small local paper in New Jersey, a reporter 

goes in to an editor and says, you know, I’ve been working for a 

month on this story but…it’s so difficult, I wish I was working for 

the New York Times.    

 

It would be so much easier if I was working for an organization 

with the deep pockets to support me, what would that editor 

say?  He would say go back and do your story.  That’s how 

journalism works.  The idea that this is tough, is not an 

argument, for them.  The idea that it is tough, is an argument for 

all the journalists who will continue to keep working regardless 

of whether the New York Times or the Washington Post go away 

tomorrow or not.

Yeah, but that’s not even what would happen, if I can argue with 

people on my own side—side.  [LAUGHTER]  If they went in, if 

that person in New Jersey went in and said I’ve been working on 

this for a month and it’s really hard, what would the editor say, 

the editor would say forget it, okay, it’s over, done with, let’s get 

on to something else.    

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL  

But you know there are interesting models, again I go back to 

this reconstruction of American journalism, this is how I spend 

my evenings when I’m not watching Monty Python.  But, I was—  

[LAUGHTER]  Eight newspapers in Ohio have come together, to 

continue the newsroom, the news reporting that that state 

needs.   In New Jersey and New York there’s a tristate—I’m 

sorry, two-state collaboration, so that you can continue some of 

the reporting, these are mainstream media organizations—

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

So I think a lot of this conversation has been about capacity 

capacity to provide… good reporting, integrity around reporting, 

accurate reporting.  And I think everyone here would agree that, 

there’s a lot of respect for places like Huffington Post and 

Politico.com.   That you all have the capacity, or are at least 

thinking about developing the capacity to provide that quality 

control.  I’m curious about, um, what about the other, all the 

other mechanisms on the Internet that don’t necessarily have 

the capacity, nor are interested in developing the capacity to 

provide that quality control.   So the Twitters, the Facebooks, the 

YouTubes where you, you log in to something and they actually 

say, this is what’s happening, but it’s folks, I had an experience 

so I downloaded something from YouTube—

JOHN DONVAN  

What you’re really saying is that there are a lotta crazy people on 

the Internet.  [LAUGHTER]   

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

A lot—a lot of crazy people.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, and I think that’s a fair point, because, Jim, for example, 

it’s not all Politico.com and I think that’s really her point, that 

they’re not all playing by your rules, which you brought in with 

you from the mainstream media.    

JIM VANDEHEI 

Crazy people aren’t a new invention.  They’ve been around for a 

long time, people who tell lies have been around for a long time, 

people who think crap information is true, have been around for 

a long time.  And I think that…what you’re going to see, it does 

put more of a burden on you, and I’ll keep coming back to this 

because there is so much information, you have to figure out 

what you trust.   The reason that I’m optimistic is I feel like new 

media is going to solve that for you, it’s not going to be old 

media, it’s going to be new models in your local communication, 

it might not be a paper that has four or five hundred employees.   

It might be a series of three or four smaller websites that do very 

specialty reporting in those communities, some might be not-for-

profit, some might be ad-supported, some might be paid content.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 80. 

 

 

 

But that’s going to happen.  And it’s happening now—that’s why 

I’m optimistic that together we can figure this out, we are 

figuring this out.    

 

And there’s a reason that mainstream media is losing readers, 

they lost touch with their readers, there’s a reason, look at the 

circulation numbers that just came out.  Across the board they 

lost 10 percent.  Some newspapers lost a much higher percent, 

in six months, they’re just losing the readers because they didn’t 

retool and they didn’t start trying to get news to you the way that 

you wanted, maybe you want it on Twitter, maybe you  want it 

on Facebook, maybe you want it in a newspaper, maybe you 

want it online.  It’s companies like ours and I think companies in 

new media that are figuring that out and are going to be the ones 

that continue to provide that and continue to fact-check for you.    

JOHN DONVAN  

The pink jacket, ma’am.  Can you stand up, please.   

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

Yes, just to your point.  You said that they’re losing readership 

because consumers are looking for alternate ways of getting 

information.  And I think part of the reason for that and a 

question to the panel is consumers are also looking for alternate 

opinions.  And they’re finding that the mainstream media, when 

70 percent of reporters say that they are Democrats or registered 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

Democrats, are only giving one view.   And this creates a 

problem because the people  [AUDIO DROP-OUT]  for getting 

information besides the mainstream media.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Phil Bronstein.  And that also goes to John Hockenberry’s point, 

that by, just by the nature of the Internet, the people working in 

it, to the degree that it’s journalism, are a far more diverse group 

than you’ll see in any newsroom you and I have ever worked in.    

PHIL BRONSTEIN   

Well, I think it was Jim who made that point and I read on the 

plane here a story --  I think it was Michael’s story, maybe --  

about Politico.  And that it was the founders of Politico walking 

towards the camera.  And they, while young, so there was a 

diversity there, they were all white males, as far as I could tell.  

Maybe I’m wrong about that.  So I don’t know how much 

diversity there is.  I do know, I mean, I can tell you from 

personal experience.  I did a blog post on SF Gate, the Chronicle 

site, talking about how nicely the press was treating President 

Obama.   And that post, widely circulated.  I found out I had all 

sorts of friends I didn’t know.  But, you know, that is not a story 

that I… that’s been scarce.    

 

In fact, I’ve read them in the last week, not just, by the way, in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 82. 

 

 

 

mainstream media but on Politico.  It had a story today in which 

I was quoted, about how President Obama is getting treated 

better than President Bush was being treated, for doing some of 

the same things.  So I don’t think that that’s an opinion that has 

been left out of mainstream media.  I do realize there’s at 

minimum, a perception issue about the political bent of 

mainstream media.  No question.   

JOHN DONVAN  

John Hockenberry.   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY 

I think the question is much more profound than simply are 

there more registered Democrats in whatever sort of hall of the 

media that you’re talking about.  What is happening here is that 

the editorial process is fundamentally shifting to your point.  

And to your point if, distribution means of information is taken 

away from a small number of institutions the diversity is 

naturally going to increase.  Further, if you have people who 

want to actually engage in the editorial process they don’t go to 

one Twitter.   

 

You know, they go to sixty or they go to sixty different platforms.  

I mean, they are a part of the editorial process in the same way 

that people who buy Beatles Rock Band get to play Ringo, if they 

want to.  The idea is existentially being a part of the editorial 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

process.  Truth telling and fact checking on their own is part of 

the experience that will become the business model of the 

future.  And if the mainstream media can’t do that because their 

editorial process is closed they’re going to lose circulation exactly 

the way Jim is talking about here.  So we’re not abolishing 

journalists and we’re not abolishing newspapers.  We are talking 

about a fundamental shift that changes the way these 

institutions have managed to survive.  And good riddance to 

that.   

JOHN DONVAN  

[OVERLAP]  And that concludes round two of our debate.  

[APPLAUSE]  And here’s where we are.  We are about to hear 

brief closing statements from each of the debaters.  They will be 

two minutes each.  And it’s their last chance to try to change 

your minds.  And from the live audience vote beforehand we 

knew where you stood before this debate and here’s what we 

have.  Our motion is:  Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media.  

And before the debate the vote among the audience members 

went like this:  twenty-five percent are for the motion, fifty 

percent are against and twenty-five are undecided.   You will be 

asked to vote one more time and pick the winner just a few 

minutes from now.  But we want to move into round three, 

closing statements.  And to speak first, against the motion --  

and this is fortunate because you wanted to respond to what 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 84. 

 

 

 

was just said --  speaking first against the motion in his 

summary remarks, Phil Bronstein, Executive Vice-President and 

Editor-at-Large of The San Francisco Chronicle.    

PHIL BRONSTEIN   

You know, I’m --  Thank you.  On the car ride over here I rode 

with Jim.  And Jim actually acknowledged that many people, 

even himself, consider Politico to be mainstream media.  The 

point is really not about definitions.  The arrogance that Jim 

referred to in newspapers for losing circulation, I think that’s a 

very real problem.  It has been a real problem and we have lost 

sight --  I call it the Higher Calling Disease – of our mission.  But 

I’m afraid I’m hearing a little too much of that same arrogance 

on the other panel about new media.  Because, let me tell you 

something, you haven’t heard from any of us that we think new 

media is bad.  They’ve made a great case that new media has all 

sorts of possibilities.  It’s like a great, wonderful shiny object.  

But the proposition you’re being asked to vote on is:  Good 

Riddance to the Mainstream Media.   

 

Therefore, the proposition says, Mainstream media has to die.  

That’s the proposition.  And my own experience is not that.  My 

own experience is when I get together with Biz Stone, who is the 

co-founder of Twitter, we talk about ways in which their massive 

pipeline of all that data and information and Tweets might be

able to be narrowed down into a verifiable set of facts that then 

professional journalists --  this is his view, and Twitter’s view --  

professional journalists then take it and run with it.  Wikimedia, 

I talked to one of their executives.  He said, We rely deeply on 

mainstream media journalism.  We are not arguing that that is 

the only way to go.  Our opponents are arguing that their way, 

that the new media way, is the only way to go.  And I just find 

that to be not a credible proposition.  So I urge you to vote... 

[LAUGHTER]  against the proposition.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN   

 [OVERLAP]  It can be confusing, yes.  Thank you, Phil 

Bronstein.  Summing, summing up his position, for the motion, 

Michael Wolff, a columnist for Vanity Fair and the founder of 

news aggregator, Newser.com.  Michael.   

MICHAEL WOLFF 

I’ve asked before how they’re going to do it.  If they want to save, 

the mainstream media they gotta have a plan other than a 

government bailout.  Phil says we want the mainstream media to 

die, that’s what we’re advocating.  That’s not the case.  What 

we’re saying is that the mainstream media is dying.  And it’s, 

going to die because things have changed.  It’s become obsolete.   

 

There is new technology.  So even if we wanted to preserve it and 

most of my day is spent in the mainstream media and I would

love to preserve it another year, another couple of years.  Many 

of us about whether we will make it to retirement.  I think 

actually we won’t.  And I think that’s what we are trying to say 

here.  It’s not to deny anything about the mainstream media --  

its virtues or its faults.  It’s just to acknowledge that something 

new has happened, a change is here.  The mainstream media 

now is functionally Detroit.  So actually, it can probably go on.  

It can limp on and on and on.  And then it won’t be able to limp 

on anymore.   Remember, we are all journalists here.  We are 

arguing for our livelihoods.  They’re arguing for their livelihoods.  

We are arguing for a new version of our livelihoods.  But what 

you should focus on is the other people, the people we serve.  We 

serve readers, we serve advertisers and we serve shareholders.  

And the mainstream media has failed in that regard and there’s 

no picking up the pieces.    

JOHN DONVAN   

Thank you, Michael Wolff.  [APPLAUSE]  Our motion is:  Good 

Riddance to the Mainstream Media.  And summarizing her 

position against the motion, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor and 

publisher of America’s longest running weekly, The Nation.    

KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL  

It’s folly to deny that change is happening.  I believe in accuracy.  

No one is talking about a government bailout for the media.  But 

we are talking about a moment of transition and transformation.

And in that moment your models --  some exciting --  are 

untested in terms of sustainability.  And I believe, and I’m not 

going to use a cliché, John --  but I believe that it is not a 

moment to dispense with what has been of value in the 

mainstream media for what I believe is important, though it 

might be scorned up here --  which is accountability, democracy.   

 

I believe those are noble principles.  And I do believe that we do 

need large, powerful institutions, barnacles attached, to take on 

powerful forces, whether corporate or government, and that the 

new media is beginning.  Not to demean the new media, but we 

need to find ways of working together to salvage quality 

journalism, which I believe is a public good in a society where 

there are too many voiceless and powerless.  And to me that is 

much more important than the myth of this liberal bias in the 

media.  It is who is heard and how people are heard and on a 

variety of platforms and of all political and ethnic and racial 

persuasions.  So that is what I believe we should today 

understand coming out of this hall, and be against the motion:  

Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media, because there are 

important elements of that to preserve.  And the new media lives 

with it, feeds on it and continues to need that, even though there 

is denial on the other side of the aisle.

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you  [APPLAUSE]  to Katrina vanden Heuvel.  

Summarizing for the motion, Jim VandeHei, Executive Editor 

and co-founder of Politico.com.    

JIM VANDEHEI 

I would urge you to vote for the proposition and I think when 

you’re about to vote you should think about their argument.  

Because I think they’re making a pretty powerful argument for 

us.  What they want you to believe is that the mainstream media 

is something that it’s not.  They want, they use words like hybrid 

or advancement or transformation.  They’re basically trying to 

argue that they are new media and they’re not.  The culture is 

different, the metabolism’s different.  I think it’s emphatically 

clear that not only is new media superior, I think it’s our only 

hope for saving timely, serious, revelatory and profitable news.   

 

So I say, Good riddance to the slow, detached, monolithic 

mainstream media, which we’ve had for the past twenty years.  

And I say that new media, we should respect the things that 

these guys have talked about.  We do respect the values of 

fairness and accuracy.  But I also think that all of us in this 

room should embrace the diversity, the transparency, the 

timeliness and the innovative spirit that you see in new media.  

That’s where the optimism is.  That’s where the ideas are.  That’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “Good Riddance to Mainstream Media” (10/27/09) Page 89. 

 

 

 

where our, for us news junkies, that’s where salvation is.  I urge 

you to remember that new media is very much in its infancy.  

And we can sort of laugh it off and we can talk about baby water, 

all we want.  But new media is working out its flaws.  Our people 

balance better the serious with the superficial.  Everyone’s aware 

that that’s an issue.   

 

People are grappling with it and it will be solved.  And we will fill 

the role of, the traditional role of a public servant.  You can’t do 

public service journalism, investigative reporting or foreign policy 

unless you make money or unless you have government subsidy 

or unless you have a not-for-profit status.  You have to make 

money to be able to support doing the foreign coverage, to 

support doing the investigative coverage.  I’m proud to say that 

profit, that Politico is, in its third year, profitable and that soon 

we’ll be able to do more and more funding of the type of 

investigative reporting that we all love.  We all share that.  

Nobody is disputing that value.  So with all that in mind I think 

it’s abundantly clear that you should vote in favor of the 

proposition because the news depends on it.    

JOHN DONVAN   

Thank you, Jim VandeHei.  [APPLAUSE]  Summarizing against 

the motion, David Carr, media columnist and reporter for the 

New York Times.

DAVID CARR  

I want to thank the audience for their attentiveness and you, 

John, for keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow and moving 

them down the road.  Tough job.  And even though I said these 

guys had what I thought was a very tough set of facts, I take my 

hat off.  I think you argued your case and argued it well.  It does 

not mean I want you to vote for them.  [LAUGHTER]  Here’s the 

thing:  we’re losing audience.  Mainstream media is not losing 

audience.  We’re not a hybrid business.  Who is it that, to take 

one website I know about --  the New York Times.  We have 

eighteen million viewers.  We have eight hundred and fifty 

thousand paper subscribers.  We need people on all manner of 

platforms.   

 

Politico, you’ll be interested to know, three times a week, puts a 

paper out on the street.  Why do they do that?  Because you 

gotta put the white paper out to get the green paper back.  

[LAUGHTER]  Okay, that’s how it works.  The problem that  

[LAUGHTER]  he has and the problem that I have is that over 

time the audience has switched to the web.  The audience that’s 

worth a buck in print is worth a dime and sometimes a penny on 

the web.  Because we end up competing oftentimes against our 

own work, aggregated.  Newser is a great looking site and you 

might want to check it out.  It aggregates all manner of content.

But I wonder if Michael’s really thought through getting rid of 

mainstream media content.  Okay.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN   

[OVERLAP]  Well, I’m thinking of the radio audience.  I’m 

thinking of the radio audience and I was going to try to describe 

what you’re doing but I can’t.    

DAVID CARR   

[OVERLAP]  I have a rather holy sheet of newspaper --  Newser, 

it’s absent mainstream media content.  It looks like Swiss cheese 

but who would want to eat Swiss cheese every day?  Vote 

against.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN   

Thank you, David Carr.  And finally, summarizing for the 

motion, John Hockenberry, co-host of the public radio morning 

news program, The Takeaway.   

JOHN HOCKENBERRY 

So, David, thank you.  Now we know what those pilots on Flight 

188 were doing in the cockpit.  [LAUGHTER]  Cutting out little,  

pictures from Newser.  I indeed am honored to be here with my 

colleagues and it’s great working once again with John Donvan.  

They have argued the point well.  They have made a lot of points 

that remind us, perhaps nostalgically, of the journalism that we 

all love and that we all want preserved up here.

But you must vote against them and for the proposition for the 

following reasons:  They’ve not demonstrated that there is a way 

to stop the changes that are afoot.  In fact, they’ve agreed that 

the changes are taking place.  There’s no way to stop them.  

They have not demonstrated how journalism is, in fact, going 

away under our model.  And they have not demonstrated that 

the current institutions they call the mainstream media are the 

only means for delivering quality journalism.  What do they say?  

It sounds sometimes they’re saying, We are going away.  Don’t 

hate us.  That’s pathetic  [LAUGHTER]  and sad, but it’s not 

relevant.  It sounds like they’re saying, We are being abolished.  

Don’t let them.  Well, that’s simply untrue.  They’re not being 

abolished.  And in fact, they would argue that we should be 

abolished or that the new media should be regulated so as to 

prevent their content from being used in new media and having 

access to readers.   

 

Finally, sometimes it seems like they are saying, We deserve to 

be protected, but they don’t say how.  And because they don’t 

you must vote against them.  They haven’t given us a practical 

reason why the mainstream media either should not go away or 

can be prevented from going away.  Finally, my brilliant 

colleague David Carr would have you believe that the New York 

Times started on this island with Pulitzer prize winning

journalists who said, We gotta start this paper to confront the 

government.  And that’s not what happened. They started 

selling, they sold a lot, they made a lot and the core values of the 

New York Times arose out of their success.  The moment has 

passed.  Vote for the proposition.  [APPLAUSE]    

JOHN DONVAN   

And that concludes our closing statements and I just have to say 

to all six of the debaters, no matter how this turns out after we 

ask the audience to pick a winner, you came with passion and 

commitment and I congratulate all of you.  It was a pleasure.  

[APPLAUSE]  And now it is time to pick the winner.  We are going 

to ask you again to decide which side you agree with and from 

that we will figure out, from that we will determine which side 

has argued best.  We are asking you now to go to the key pad of 

each seat that will register your vote.  And we will get this 

readout almost instantaneously.  Remember, push number one 

if you are for the motion:  Good Riddance to the Mainstream 

Media.  Push number two if you are against, number three if you 

became or remain undecided. I’m going to have the results in 

just about ninety seconds so in the meantime I want to take care 

of a little bit of business.  First of all, I want to thank of you and, 

again, our debaters for a terrific evening.   

 

Our next debate will be on Monday, November 16th.  The motion

is:  Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.  

Panelists for the motion are:  Steve Rattner, who served as 

Counselor to the Secretary of the Treasury and as Car Czar:  

Elliot Spitzer, former Governor and Attorney General of New 

York:  and Mark Zandi, Chief Economist and co-Founder of 

Moody’sEconomy.com.  Against the motion we’ll have:  James 

Galbraith, Economics Professor at the LBJ School of Public 

Affairs at the University of Texas:  Economist Robert Kuttner, 

who is the co-founder and co-editor of The American Prospect:  

and the seventy-second Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Paul 

O’Neill.  Tickets are still available through our website and at the 

Skirball box office.  All of our debates, as we said at the

percent of you were for the motion, Good Riddance to the 

Mainstream Media:  fifty percent were against and twenty-five 

percent were undecided.   And before we reveal that, actually,

this again.  Before the debate, our motion being:  Good Riddance 

to the Mainstream Media, twenty-five percent of you were for the 

motion, fifty percent were against, twenty-five percent were 

undecided.   After the debate, twenty-four percent of you are for 

the motion, sixty-eight percent against, eight percent undecided.

congratulations to them.  Thank you.  In the meantime, John
