John Donvan: 
Tonight we have a partner, a new partner in this.  We are sharing credit with the fact 
that we're putting this debate on with Columbia University's Richard Paul Richmond 
Center for Business Law and Public Policy.  That -- 
 
[applause] 
 
I can see the spontaneous applause thing is going to work really well.  I do want to say 
that it's a joint venture of the law school and the business school.  And they have, as we 
do, a goal of trying to raise the level of public discourse, in their case where law, and 
markets, and business intersect.  So, again, I  thank you, let's give them a round of 
applause --

The other reason we have these debates, of course, is because of the Rosenkranz 
Foundation, which launched them six years ago and sponsored them, and I want a 
welcome now to help us frame the debate and talk about why we're doing this by 
inviting onto the stage the chairman of the board of Intelligence Squared U.S., Mr. 
Robert Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
So, Bob, as I always ask you before these debates, why this one and why now? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, the reason why now is because the theme of taxes and tax policy has been a very 
divisive theme throughout the presidential campaign and the presidential debates, and 
we're trying to bring this to a -- perhaps more sophisticated level here tonight. 
 
18:53:52 
 
 
John Donvan: 
And this motion has a tricky word, "enough," what do we intend by putting the word, 
"enough," into this motion? 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, I thought really that there would be three criteria by which one might decide that. 
 One is the matter of fairness, one is efficiency, and one is sufficiency. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, take us through fairness, what it means for each side. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, for the pro the motion side, fairness would be the point of view of somebody in 
the top 1 percent who's paying 40 percent of all the taxes in America or the top 5 
percent which is paying 60 percent, they're going to see the system as fair.  On the other 
hand, if you work for a billionaire who's paying a lower tax rate than you are, you're not 
going to see it as fair.  
 
John Donvan: 
And sufficiency. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Sufficiency really means, "Are we raising enough revenues to put the government on a 
fiscal path that makes some sense?"  And I think the pro motion side is going to point to 
the fact that it's really spending that's the problem.

18:54:56 
 
We're spending about 24 percent of GNP on federal expenditures.  The norm in the last 
20 years have been about 21 percent, and we've got to get spending under control.  The 
other side is going to say, "Wait a second.  Tax collections are only about 16 percent of 
GNP compared to 19 percent.  We need to raise more money."  And if we remember the 
words of Willie Sutton, "Go where the money is." 
 
John Donvan: 
And efficiency was the last part of it you mentioned. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, efficiency is the idea of promoting economic growth.  What kind of tax system 
would best stimulate the growth in the economy?  And I think the pro the motion side is 
going to argue that it's very, very important to preserve the incentives that the "rich," 
quote, unquote, have to risk money to invest to create jobs for others.  The against the 
motion side is probably going to point to the fact that a dollar in the hands of a middle 
class family is going to be spent, and in a direct way stimulate economic activity; 
whereas a dollar in the hands of a rich person might just sit there. 
 
18:56:03 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, Bob, thanks very much in that slicing the word “enough,” enough has a lot of 
meanings, and thank you for framing this for us.  And let's welcome our debaters to the 
stage. 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Good. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, thank you.  And may I invite one more round of applause for Robert 
Rosenkranz for bringing this to us. 
 
[applause] 
 
If you ask, "do the rich pay their fair in taxes?" you really do have to ask a couple of 
other questions.  You’ve got to ask, well, what do you mean by rich?

How much, how much is rich?  How much money does that take?  And, what do we 
mean by "enough"?  Now, consider that to be counted in the top 1 percent of earners in 
America, you need to be making approximately $380,000 a year.  Consider, also, that 
that 1 percent pays more than a third, as of 2009, pays more than a third of all of the 
federal income tax that comes in to the federal government.  Is that too much?  Is that 
too little?  Well, let's make a debate of it.  True or false, the rich are taxed enough. 
 Another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S., I'm John Donvan, we have four superbly 
qualified debaters who will be arguing for, and against, this motion:  The Rich Are Taxed 
Enough.  They go in three rounds and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and 
only one side wins.  Our debaters include, on the side arguing for the motion, Glenn 
Hubbard, Dean of Columbia Business School and economic advisor to Mitt Romney. 
 
18:57:55 
 
[applause] 
 
Your partner it Art Laffer, he is best known for the Laffer Curve, one of the main 
theoretical constructs of supply side economics. 
 
[applause] 
 
On the side arguing against the motion, Robert Reich, he's a professor at UC Berkeley 
and former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. 
 
[applause] 
 
And his partner, Mark Zandi, he's chief economist of Moody's Analytics. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion is this: The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  Let's meet our debaters and welcome 
first, Glenn Hubbard. 
 
[applause] 
 
Glenn, you are dean of the Columbia Business School, you are also -- throughout 2012, 
you've been advisor to Mitt Romney's campaign.  Recently you were profiled in The New 
 York Times, and you were described there as, "succinct, authoritative, and unabashedly 
partisan."   
 
18:58:59 
 
I want to know, is that fair?  Are you unabashedly partisan?  And could you be succinct 
and authoritative?

[laughter] 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Well, I am always succinct.  To the partisan, I guess I'm old enough to remember when 
Bill Bradley and I collaborated on an idea that's not too far dissimilar to tonight.  And 
President Obama's housing plans follow work by me and by a colleague at Columbia. 
 
John Donvan: 
And your partner is? 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
My partner is Art Laffer. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Art Laffer.   
 
[applause] 
 
Art, you were an economic adviser to President Reagan; you served as chief economist 
at the Office of Management and Budget.  You're best known as the father of supply 
side economics because of the curve that is named after you.  And I think it's fortuitous 
that your last name was not McDougal or Rabinowitz, or Kowalski, because we would be 
talking about the Kowalski curve.  Your name adds a certain light-heartedness to your 
curve -- 
 
18:59:53 
 
[laughter] 
 
And you are a lighthearted guy.  In two sentences or less, what is the Laffer curve 
about? 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Well, number one, the Laffer curve really is my profile. 
 
[laughter] 
 
And the other famous thing about me is I am a little bit taller than Robert Reich.

John Donvan: 
Our motion is The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  And here to 
argue against the motion, Robert Reich. 
 
[applause] 
 
You're a professor of public policy at UC Berkeley, former Secretary of Labor in the 
Clinton administration.  You are a bit of an intellectual brawler yourself, and you can 
dish it out.  You've also had to take it.  Bill O'Reilly recently called you "a communist who 
secretly adores Karl Marx." 
 
[laughter] 
 
Neil Cavuto said you were a sanctimonious twit.  
 
[laughter] 
 
Question is, does this stuff really hurt your feelings? 
 
Robert Reich: 
No, not at all -- [crying] 
 
19:00:51 
 
[laughter] 
No.  Actually, I don't know how Bill Reilly knew that I was a secret admirer of Karl Marx 
because it was a secret. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
And -- 
 
Robert Reich: 
Logic on that side of the aisle. 
 
John Donvan: 
And your partner is?

I'm nervous about this now.  You're going to be nice, right?  You're going to be nice? 
 
John Donvan: 
This is so easy. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah, okay, all right. 
 
John Donvan: 
You are the chief economist of Moody's Analytics, and you have one of the most widely 
followed economic forecasts.  That was nice. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
That was nice, yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
That was very nice. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah.  I'll take that.  I'm a great guy, too. 
 
John Donvan: 
Here's the other part of it.  When the Bush cuts neared expiration in 2010, you at that 
time were in favor of their extension initially? 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yes, I was, yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
Now? 
 
Mark Zandi: 
I think the president's proposal is the appropriate proposal, allow the tax rates for upper 
income individuals to expire. 
 
John Donvan: 
So, you do get to change your mind?

Mark Zandi: 
No, I am an eclectic economist in that I think the economics depend on the times, and 
the times now are such that we've got to address our fiscal problems.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mark Zandi.  Ladies and gentlemen, our debaters for this evening. 
 
[applause] 
 
Now, in this debate, you, our live audience, act as our judges.  By the time the debate 
has ended, we will have asked you to vote twice, once before you've heard the 
arguments and once again after you've heard the arguments, and the team whose 
numbers have moved your votes the most from beginning to end will be declared our 
winner.  So, let's register the first vote.  If you go to the keypad that's at the right hand 
of your seat, our motion is this: The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  If you agree with that 
motion as you come in off the street, push Number 1.  If you disagree, push Number 2. 
 If you're undecided, push Number 3.  All of the other keys, you can ignore.  They're 
inoperable.  And you can also correct yourself if you've pushed the wrong button.  And, 
again, this is being -- these are wireless devices, so they're all being recorded backstage 
and tabulated.  And then, at the end of the evening, it takes about as long as it takes me 
to finish this sentence, we'll have the results again quickly comparing the two votes.   
 
19:02:59 
 
All right.  Let's launch.  Our motion is The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  On to Round 1, 
opening statements from each of our debaters and turn, and speaking first for the 
motion, The Rich Are Taxed Enough, Glenn Hubbard, who is Dean of the Columbia 
Business School.  He was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President 
George W. Bush, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax policy in the Treasury 
Department, ladies and gentlemen, Glenn Hubbard. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Thank you.  Thank -- 
 
[applause] 
 
I'd certainly like to thank Intelligence Squared and the Richmond Center for an event on 
topic this important.  My partner, Art Laffer, the eponymous economist, will follow with 
some great thoughts on why raising tax rates is the wrong place to start.  But I just want 
to make two points this evening.   
 
19:03:50

First, raising tax rates on the rich is both counterproductive and unnecessary to fund the 
government that Americans have traditionally had.  I'll come back to that point.  Second, 
if we do want a larger government, and that's a political choice, the extra taxes to pay 
for that government will largely come from the non-rich.  Now, let's start with how high 
tax rates are.  If you look at survey data and ask Americans what they think is fair that 
about a quarter or a bit more would be fair in taxes paid.  If that's true, the current and 
projected marginal tax rates -- that is the tax rate on the next dollar that you earn -- are 
very high for upper income folks, 35 percent for ordinary income.  And, if you're New 
Yorkers in this audience, you know that by omitting state and local taxes, I'm leaving a 
lot on the table here.  And 15 percent for dividends and capital gains, but of course 
corporate taxes were already paid there.  And, on top of that, there's an estate tax that 
taxes money that had already been taxed once or twice in someone's lifetime.   
 
19:04:55 
 
All of these taxes are set to rise substantially next year, 40 percent for earned income, 
44 percent for dividends, 24 percent for capital gains, and beyond.  Now, the calls for 
higher tax rates really raise two concerns.  First, if you step back, they treat the nation's 
income as an already big pie, and it doesn't really matter for the size of that pie how it's 
sliced.  An economic observation of that is that ignores a lot of incentives that taxes 
have on the decisions we all make.  Those sorts of incentives would lead to lower 
activity, lower jobs, and lower incomes.  The second choice here is that the real fiscal 
policy choice facing the nation is really about the size of government.  And here my 
observation isn't economics, it's just arithmetic: if we want the larger government, we 
all will have to pay for it.   
 
19:05:51 
 
The bulk of the taxes will come from the non-rich.  Now, let's start, first, on the cost of 
raising tax rates.  Now, I can look out and tell that your favorite course in college was, of 
course, economics, and you remember, from the public finance lecture in that class, you 
can boil it down to a simple sentence: if you tax something you get less of it.  And 
economists worry, particularly, about tax rates that are already high.  Now, some of the 
somethings we get less of are work and saving.  And, here, I just want to offer you a 
forecast, and I should be honest with you that President Bush once said about me that 
"Glenn can't even forecast the past." 
 
[laughter] 
 
And I think what the president meant was data get revised, but you take that for what 
it's worth.  But economists, like me, and my own academic research, have forecast 
changes in taxable income from changes in tax rates.  The responses of high income tax 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

payers are not only absolutely high, they are much higher than the responses of other 
tax payers. 
 
19:06:55 
 
Of particular concern in this regard is the taxation of business income.  High business 
taxes discourage investments in machines and ideas and jobs.  More than half of 
Americans who work in the private sector work for businesses whose owner pay taxes 
at individual rates.  Raising taxes on those business owners discourages hiring, 
discourages investment.  If you make a comparison of next year's tax law, with higher 
rates, to the much bally-hooed Bowles-Simpson plan, you'd find that the lower tax rates 
in Bowles-Simpson that are financed by broadening the tax base, would raise 
investment in businesses by 54 percent, and raise hiring by 14 percent.  And high tax 
rates don't necessarily produce revenue.  The fact that revenue shares and GDP haven't 
varied substantially across periods when the top marginal rate was more than 70 
percent, from when it was less than, or about, 28 percent, suggests that we have a lot of 
lost taxable income and a lot of wasteful tax planning when we have high tax times.   
 
19:08:01 
 
The right answer is tax reform to raise money from upper income households by 
broadening the tax base, and to seek expenditure reform that also reduces benefits for 
those tax payers.  Now, what about the larger government?  Before the financial crisis, 
federal spending in the U.S. averaged about 20 percent of GDP for many decades.  What 
if we decide we'd like a bigger government?  Let's say 25 percent, or maybe a larger 
number, like many European countries.  Shouldn't raising tax rates on the rich pay for 
that government?  Well, the simple answer is no.  Or, more accurately, it can't.  If you 
look across the OECD, the club of rich industrial nations, you'll find something that may 
surprise some of you.  The U.S. has the most progressive tax system.   
 
19:08:52 
 
And, in fact, the U.S. tax system actually decreased inequality more than any other 
country's tax system.  So you think to yourself, "Well, how can this be? We're thinking of 
European nations with large government and social welfare programs."  But the answer 
is simple, for reasons of arithmetic, that is, there's just not that much income at the top, 
and economics, consequences for investment and for jobs would be too grim, those 
nations actually use broad based consumption taxes, like a VAT that are borne by all 
citizens to fund their spending.  So the real choice is the size of government.  That's the 
debate we need to have first.  Taxation should be fair, but it should also seek to advance 
growth and living standards.  The right tax system for this country can accomplish both. 
 And so, for the government of the size that we all have been used to before the past 
few years, we can, we should, accomplish both fairness and growth without raising tax 
rates on high income individuals.

19:10:01 
 
If we, the body politic, want a larger government, we all must pay.  The rich are not a 
plug number in a budget gambit for a free lunch.  For the proposition, The Rich Are 
Taxed Enough, the answer is clear, and it's yes.  
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Glenn Hubbard.  Our motion is The Rich Are Taxed Enough, and now here to 
speak against the motion, I'd like to introduce Robert Reich, he is the chancellor's 
professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, and the former 
Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. 
 
[applause] 
 
Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Reich. 
 
Robert Reich: 
As you can see, the economy has worn me down. 
 
19:10:51 
 
[laughter] 
 
But we're in a recovery. 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
Look.  I think this is an absurd motion, and I urge you to vote against it when you have a 
chance to vote against it again.  It's an absurd motion for the following reasons. 
 Number one, we have a huge budget deficit.  Even if we didn't want to expand the size 
of government, even if we want to contract the size of government, we still have a 
gigantic budget deficit.  And the debt is about 85 percent, by some measures, of gross 
domestic product.  And the question is how do you get the deficit down?  How do you 
get the debt down?  Well, almost everybody who has looked at the issue has said it's got 
to be some combination of tax increases and spending cuts.  The Simpson-Bowles 
commission, to which my esteemed colleague referred to, said, "Well, we have one 
dollar of tax increases for every three dollars of spending cuts."   
 
19:11:50 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
But there have got to be some tax increases, and the real question here isn't the size of 
government, the real question here is who is going to bear the brunt of the tax 
increases.  Is it going to be people mostly at the top, or is it going to be people who are 
in the middle, or is it people who are poor?  And I want to tell you in terms of common 
sense and logic and fairness, it ought to be people at the top.  Why, why, why? 
 
[applause] 
 
You can applaud, but don't take away from my time. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Why?  Because number one, people at the top have never had it so good.  I mean, the 
percentage of total income in this country going to people who are in the top one 
percent, has doubled over the past 30 years.  It used to be 10 percent back in 1980.  It's 
now over 20 percent.  That is people in the top 1 percent are now getting over 20 
percent of total income.  If you're in the top one tenth of 1 percent, your share didn't 
just double, it actually tripled over the last 30 years.   
 
19:12:50 
 
If you're in the top one-one-hundredth of 1 percent, your share quadrupled of total 
income over the last 30 years.  The richest 400 Americans have more wealth than the 
bottom 150 million of us put together.  And this kind of asymmetry, this kind of 
distorted gap between the top and the wealthiest people and everybody else is really 
something new in this country, at least within people's living memory.  It wasn't this way 
in the '50s or '60s or '70s.  It wasn't even nearly this way in the '80s.  So, if we're going to 
have to raise taxes, obviously fairness and logic would indicate you raise them on the 
top.  Now, Glenn Hubbard is talking about, "Well, you have a negative effect, a negative 
incentive effect."  Come on.  In the immortal words of Joe Biden, "Malarkey!" 
 
[laughter] 
 
19:13:51 
 
I mean, look.  The tax rate -- the marginal tax rate on top incomes -- go back before 1981 
-- for at least three decades before 1981, the top marginal tax rate in this country was at 
least 70 percent.  Under Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
Republican, who nobody would have accused of being a socialist -- Bill O'Reilly would 
not have called him a communist -- and yet the marginal tax rate on the top incomes 
under Eisenhower was 91 percent.  If you get rid of all the deductions and tax credits, 
it's still -- the effective tax rate under Eisenhower is closer to 56 percent, much higher 
than anybody today is talking about.  We're talking -- right now, we're talking about the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

difference between, what, a 35 percent tax rate and maybe going back to Bill Clinton's 
days?  I mean, this is a ridiculous debate.  It should not even be debated obviously.   
 
19:14:51 
 
Given where we were before and where we are now, we shouldn't even be raising this 
question.  I mean, they will say higher taxes have a negative impact on economic 
growth.  Well, guess what?  In the three decades before 1981, when taxes were higher 
on the rich, the economy on average per year grew faster than it has grown since 1981. 
 There was no negative impact on growth.  I mean, George W. Bush reduces -- 
remember 1981 -- 2001, 2003, he reduces taxes on the wealthy, saying, "Oh, we're 
going to get this huge increase in growth, and we're going to get all kinds of jobs," using 
and spouting supply-side -- excuse me, Art -- nonsense -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- and what did we get?  We actually had less growth.  We had fewer jobs, even before 
the great crash.  We had an economy that did not perform nearly as well as it did under 
the president I was very proud to have served under, that is Bill Clinton, who raised 
taxes.   
 
19:15:54 
 
We had the largest and longest boom in modern memory, 22 million new jobs were 
created.  That wasn't a negative growth, that was not a slowdown in growth.  We raised 
taxes, 22 million new jobs were created.  I was secretary of labor during those times.  I 
created every single one of those jobs. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Thank you.  Thank you very much. 
 
[applause] 
 
So just to -- in summary -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- we have to raise taxes in order to deal with the budget deficit, regardless of what your 
particular ideology is about a smaller or larger government.  Number two, the rich have 
done extraordinarily well.  Everybody else hasn't.  In fact, median family incomes since 
2000 have actually dropped 8 percent.  You want to put more taxes on average working 
people?  No.  That's simply not fair.   
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

19:16:55 
 
It's not going to work.  Number three, the rich right now bear a lower, smaller, marginal 
tax burden than they have at any time in the post-war era.  Of course you have to raise 
taxes on the rich if we're going to get on with the business of this country.  So please 
vote against this silly proposition.  Thank you.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Robert Reich.  And I remind you of where we are.  We are halfway through 
the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate.  My name is John Donvan. 
 We have four debaters, two teams of two who are arguing it out over this motion: The 
Rich Are Taxed Enough.  You have heard the first two debaters, and now on to the third. 
 I'd like to introduce and bring to the lectern Art Laffer.  He is the founder and chairman 
of Laffer Associates and Laffer Investments.  He is known as the father of supply side 
economics, was a former advisor to President Ronald Reagan.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
Art Laffer. 
 
19:17:52 
 
[applause] 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
If I can just start with this hotel you guys got for us today, I had the craziest thing 
happen.  I came in a little early.  And I went down to the health club.  And now, I'm not 
an exercise freak or anything.  But I was down there.  And this absolutely gorgeous 
woman walked in.  She's just beautiful.  And the manager of the health club was 
standing right next to me, so I said, "Excuse me, by any chance do you have a machine 
that would attract someone like that to someone like me?" 
 
[laughter] 
 
And the guy says, "Yes, I do."  And he took me over to the Citicorp ATM. 
 
[laughter] 
 
And I just want to say that the rich are not the Citicorp ATM.  If you look at this world, 
and I -- but, Robert, you're a favorite of mine, and you have been for years; and, Glenn, 
you did a great job on this; and Mark, I'm anticipating your comments and -- but look at 
it, you got -- there would be three reasons you could possibly want to raise tax rates on 
the rich.  You're jealous of them, and Robert may be but he's one of them.

[laughter] 
 
And the other thing is, you're going to get more revenue.  And you're going to create 
prosperity.  Those are the other two.  And I'm going to land on the last two and look at 
the facts if I can.  I mean, in the 30 -- if you look at the growth rate there, we can go 
back in time, but, you know, if you look at the periods let's say from the Roaring '20s, we 
cut tax rates back then from 73 percent to 25 percent in the Roaring '20s.  It was called 
the "Roaring ‘20s" for a reason.  We had enormous expansion of growth, output, and 
employment.  The top 1 percent of income earners, now, we have great data on the top 
1 percent of income earners.  The IRS really likes to know how much you owe them. 
 And we have great data.  The top 1 percent of income earners, their taxes as a share of 
GDP soared during the period of the Roaring '20s.  If you look at the 1930s, we raised 
the highest margin -- well, we first had [unintelligible] May of 1930 we had the Smoot-
Hawley Tariff.   
 
19:19:53 
 
Then Hoover raised the highest tax rate on the rich from 25 percent to 63 percent.  Then 
Roosevelt on January 1936 raised it from 63 to 79 percent and then up to 83 percent. 
 There's a reason why it was called the Great Depression.  The economy was in a 
shambles in large part because of the tax increases.  The revenues from the top 1 
percent of income earners as a share of GDP went down during this period.  You look at 
the Kennedy period where we cut the highest tax rates from 91 percent to 70 percent. 
 We also put in the investment tax credit, accelerated depreciation, cut the corporate 
rates, did tariff reform as well -- the Kennedy-run tariff negotiation, tax rate -- it was 
called the -- it was called the "Go-Go '60s," if you remember, a boom in the economy, 
and tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners went up during that period 
as a share of GDP.  We then had the four stooges, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Which I consider to be the largest assemblage of bipartisan ignorance probably ever put 
on planet Earth.   
 
19:20:57 
 
If you look at that period, we had stagnation for 16 straight years.  The stock market 
collapsed during that period.  Tax revenues for the top 1 percent of income earners 
went down as a share of GDP.  Then we had -- then we had Ronny -- oh, excuse me, the 
sky is opened, the sun shone forth on the planet, the grass turned green, the animals, 
they multiplied, the children danced in the street, but we cut the highest tax rates of 
everything we could find.  We had Steiger-Hansen in '78, then we cut the -- I mean, 
under Reagan, cut it from 70 percent to 28 percent.  If you look at the whole period 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

from 1978 all the way to 2007, we cut the highest tax rate on earned income from 50 
percent to 35 percent.  We cut the highest tax rates on unearned income from 70 
percent to 15 percent.   
 
19:21:53 
 
We cut the capital gains tax rate, we cut all of these tax rates across the board.  We had 
a boom, and it wasn't just Ronald Reagan.  Robert, your president, by the way, cut the 
capital gains tax rate dramatically; he got rid of capital gains taxes on owner occupied 
homes for everyone, he also got rid of the tax on retirees working, which was the group 
between 65 and 72.  He also put in welfare reform, he also cut gtovernment spending as 
a share of GDP by more than the next four best presidents combined, and he had the 
greatest secretary of labor of all time -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
But he was a big taxer.  We had huge growth during that period.  If you look at what 
happened to the tax revenues from the top income earners -- you know, in 1980 tax 
revenues as share of GDP from the top 1 percent was 1.5 percent of GDP.  By 2007, tax 
revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners was 3.2 percent of GDP, it more 
than doubled.   
 
19:22:55 
 
Let me tell you really honestly, you're not going to get the money from these guys. 
 You're not.  They can hire lawyers, they can hire accountants, they can hire deferred 
income specialists, they can hire congressmen, they can hire senators -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
They can hire -- when you see a group of people hanging with the president, don't for a 
moment think it's a group of street people trying to explain to the president what it's 
like being poor.  They're in there for some reason and they find it.  You know, what you 
really want to do is get a low rate, flat tax, where you have no exceptions, no 
exemptions, no deductions, none of that stuff.  And get them out of the business of 
trying to finagle their tax codes, get them out of the business of trying to influence 
government, get them into a position where they create prosperity and economic 
growth.  And that is the way you got to go.  We all want increased tax rates on the rich, 
but we want to do it not by raising rates, which won't work, we want to do it by 
lowering rates and broadening the base.  And if I can correct one other little mistake, 
Robert, just a little one.

Simpson-Bowles lowers the highest tax rates on the rich, and so does Rivlin-Domenici. 
 They lower rates, they broaden the base.  In '86, we cut tax rates on the rich 
dramatically, from 50 percent to 28 percent.  In the Senate, 97 votes for that, three 
against it, including Joe Biden.  What was his malarkey comment?  Excuse me, maybe he 
was looking in the mirror.  But you also had Bill Bradley, you also had Howard 
Metzenbaum, you had all of these -- and you had Chris Dodd and you had Teddy 
Kennedy.  Everyone knows that you don't create growth by raising tax rates on the rich. 
 You can't love jobs and hate job creators.

And you can't tax an economy into prosperity, it ain't going to happen.  Thank you very 
much. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Art Laffer.  Thank you, Art Laffer.  Our motion is The Rich Are Taxed Enough. 
 And here is our final speaker, making his opening statement, Mark Zandi.   
 
19:24:54 
 
Mark is the chief economist of Moody's Analytics and is one of the most frequently cited 
economists in Washington; he's also the author of this book, "Paying the Price, Ending 
the Great Recession, and Beginning a New American Century."  Ladies and gentlemen, 
Mark Zandi. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Thank you, John.  Thank you.  Thank you, John.  Thanks, Intelligence Squared and Bob 
Rosenkranz for the opportunity.  I did notice that on Amazon the price of my book is 
falling; demand, supply, you know.  
 
[laughter] 
 
We need a little more demand here to help me out.  Let me begin by saying that, you 
know, it's obvious the American economy has very serious challenges.  But I would put 
two right at the top of the list.  The first, this is in no particular order of importance, but 
the first is, the skewing of the distribution of income consumption and wealth, and the 
second is our fiscal problems.   
 
19:25:51 
 
The statistics here are pretty startling.  Let's begin with the income distribution, wealth 
distribution.  If you take the top 20 percent of income earners, they take home over 50 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

percent of the nation's income, the top 20 percent take home 50 percent of the income. 
 They consume 60 percent of the total pie.  So, from cars to clothing and everything in 
between, they consume 60 percent.  And they own 90 percent of the wealth.  These are 
pretty skewed statistics.  And the more startling thing is they've gotten more skewed 
over the past 30 years.  You know, you go back to the early 1980s, late 1970s, these 
statistics were very different.  I'll just give you one example.  I mentioned that the top 
20 percent accounts for 60 percent of the spending.  If you go back to 1980, it was closer 
to 45 percent.   
 
19:26:50 
 
So, it's skewed, and it's getting more skewed.  Our fiscal problems are obviously very 
significant as well.  If you go back to the year 2000 -- we'll give Bob credit for the 22 
million jobs.  Should we give you credit for the surplus in the year 2000, too?  Okay, Bob. 
 Let's clap for that. 
 
[applause] 
 
There was a surplus, 2000.  We've been running deficits ever since.  The last fiscal year 
just ended.  We had a deficit of $1.1 trillion.  You can ask, "Well, what's going on?"  Lots 
of things.  There's the wars.  That's $1.2 trillion over the last 10 years.  That's 
Afghanistan and Iraq.  There's the Bush era tax cuts.  According to the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office, that cost us $1.6 trillion over a 10 year period.  And, of 
course, there was a recession, the great recession, and by my calculation, that's cost us 
about $1.8 trillion over the course of the last 10 years.  You add it up, it's a lot of money. 
 So, we've got some big problems, very significant issues we have to tackle.   
 
19:27:51 
 
Now, the bad news is that -- it sounds pretty bad -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
The bad news is that if we -- these trends will continue if policymakers don't act.  If they 
don't act, these trends will continue, and this will harm economic growth, become very 
self-reinforcing in a negative way.  Take the deficits.  If policymakers continue on with 
current policy, if they don't do anything with the current tax rates, if they don't cut 
spending as agreed to as part of the sequestration, if they don't address the payroll tax 
holiday, you can go on and on and on, well, the nation's debt-to-GDP ratio is going to go 
from the current 70 percent -- and, by the way, it's doubled over the last 10 years from 
35 to 70 percent -- it'll go over 100 percent by 2025.  Now, all good research would 
show that we got a problem if that happens.  The world's not going to work for us.   
 
19:28:50

At some point, investors are going to balk.  Interest rates are going to rise.  It's going to 
affect investment, productivity growth, and our living standards.  That has to change. 
 And the income and wealth distribution, the forces that are driving that aren't going to -
- are firmly in place, and they're not going to change.  There's many.  Globalization -- a 
great recent piece in the New York Times, going over this, globalization, technological 
change -- these are all really very good things for our economy.  We need to continue on 
with the process of globalization and certainly technological change improves all our 
lives, but clearly it affects the distribution of income and wealth.  I'm a person with no 
skills and talent, I'm getting creamed by trade.  I'm competing against low-wage workers 
in China and India.  I can't compete.  I'm just getting crushed.  And, of course, high 
income households are benefitting enormously, right?  I mean, Glenn, Art, Bob go off to 
China, they go off to India, they go off to the UK to give a speech, they get paid very 
well.   
 
19:29:49 
 
Unfortunately, I'm not in their class, you know?  I don't get paid as well.  But, it's 
globalization that allows them to get these great returns, and their income and wealth 
rises.  And I think the problem here is that if we don't address the skewing of the 
distribution and wealth, the disenfranchised are going to say, "Enough!"  And they're 
going to stop the process of globalization, and they're going to rebel against the pace of 
technological change, and that's going to be to everyone's detriment, including higher 
income households.  Now, here's the good news.  We can solve this problem, and we 
can solve it together in a combined way.  We have to think about addressing our fiscal 
problems through the prism of the income -- the distribution of income and wealth.  So, 
we need to cut government spending?  Absolutely.  We have to do this.  But, we have to 
do this in a way that's intelligent and maybe means-testing for entitlement programs. 
 You know, take -- change the entitlement programs for the wealthy into insurance 
policies, but that only goes so far.   
 
19:30:51 
 
We don't want to go to the point where the insurance policies become a welfare 
program and we lose support for things like Medicare and Social Security.  That'd only 
take us so far.  So we have to address taxes.  If I were king for the day, I wouldn't raise 
tax rates on anybody, and I don't think we need to, right?  I am all for tax reform.  Let's 
close the deductions, let's close the loopholes, let's make the tax code fairer, broaden 
the base, I'm all for it, but let's use the revenue to address our fiscal problems, not to 
cut tax rates, until we're able to do that, right?  I mean, that is the best way, that is the 
way proposed by Simpson-Bowles, that's the way proposed by Domenici-Rivlin, and that 
is a bipartisan way.  So this is not hard.  It's -- we can do it, and that's the good news. 
 Now, let me end this way with a personal note.  I started my own company back 25 
years ago with a good friend and my best friend and my brother.  And I wasn't in the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 -

proverbial garage but I was pretty close.  It grew into a pretty good size -- a small 
business.   
 
19:31:52 
 
I had 100 employees when I sold it to the Moody's Corporation.  And the reason I'm 
telling you this is because I wanted to let you know that I'm not just an egghead.  You 
know, I look like one maybe, but I'm not.  So I look at these things through the -- in 
terms of data, theory, and experience.  And my experience says, "You need to vote 
against this proposition."  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mark Zandi.  
 
[applause] 
 
And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate where the debaters 
are arguing it out over this motion: The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  Now we move on to 
Round 2.  And Round 2 is where the debaters address each other and take questions 
from me and from you in the audience.  Our motion is this: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. 
 We have two teams of two arguing it out.  The team arguing for the motion, Glenn 
Hubbard and Arthur Laffer, are basically saying that taxing the rich is something that is 
absolutely going to backfire, that taxes have consequences on behavior, and that the 
wealthy, who would be the provider of jobs by being the builders of factories would be 
discouraged from doing so.   
 
19:32:56 
 
And that as a result of that, not only would they be able to dodge their taxes as Art 
Laffer pointed out by hiring lawyers and he also said hiring senators -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- but they will also not be giving jobs to people who would help broaden the tax base. 
 The side arguing against the motion, Robert Reich and Mark Zandi, are saying, "It's 
absolutely common sense when you have to close a budget gap to go where the money 
is, that you go to tax the rich because they have an -- disproportionate amount of the 
wealth in the country to a degree that they never have before, and that the argument 
that taxing the wealthy will lead to depressions and recessions has not been borne out 
over certain periods of time.  And we know that both sides to some degree are 
wandering through forests of data, and each are finding their own path possibly through 
the same forest --

[laughter] 
 
-- picking out different periods of time to prove their points, but I want to go to -- before 
we get to -- 
 
19:33:53 
 
 
Male Speaker: 
But that's what economists do, John. 
 
John Donvan: 
Well, yeah, and it's very exciting, I have to -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- before we get to the parsing of the data, I want to get to something of an overall 
theme.  We've been talking about The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  And "enough" has a 
couple of connotations, and one is "enough" to actually bring in revenues to pay for the 
government.  The other is "enough" to be fair, to meet some sense of fairness.  And I 
want to bring to the side that's arguing for the motion that The Rich Are Taxed Enough, 
the question of fairness.  Is the system, as it is now, at tax rates that exist now, in a 
system that -- the one that we have, is it fair?  Art Laffer. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Yeah.  No, it's not.  It's totally not.  And let me use an example if I may, Warren Buffett. 
 He was sitting there asking my friends and I need to have higher tax rates, and I looked 
at his letter to the New York Times, and he said he paid a little less than 7 million in 
taxes, and he said his tax rate was 17.4 percent, which I did the math, hold back, I'm a 
wiz, but I divided it.  He had adjusted gross income of $40 million in that year.   
 
19:34:54 
 
I then went to Forbes.  His wealth increased from 40 billion to 50 billion.  I went to the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and what you found there is he gave 1.75 billion to 
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, not counting his sons’ foundations or his 
daughter's foundation.  Now, as a definition of "income," to me income is what you 
spend, what you give away, and your increase in your wealth.  It s called the Simon 
definition of income.  If you look at Bill Gates -- I mean -- if you look at Warren Buffett, 
his income that year was $12 billion, and he paid 7 million in taxes.  That is a tax rate of 
six 1/100th of 1 percent on his true income.  That is obnoxious.  But it's not because of 
any rates raising would change that tax.  You've got to broaden the tax base by getting 
rid of all these exclusions, deductions, eliminations, and tax true income at low rates.   



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
19:35:51 
 
And that is what's fair.  The guys who play the game, and you look at the Forbes 500 and 
you see all of them with their tax exemptions, look at all the 501c3s, all the loopholes. 
 That's what we've got to go after, not raising tax rates on the last three people who 
actually pay it.  
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let me go to Bob, Bob Reich. 
 
Robert Reich: 
I keep on hearing my good friend Arthur Laffer talking about broadening the base.  Now, 
do you know exactly what he's talking about when he talks about broadening the base? 
 Because it sounds good, doesn't it?  I mean, you want to broaden the base; everybody 
wants to broaden the base. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But, Arthur, let's be specific.  Are you willing to close loopholes that the very rich are 
mostly taking advantage of? 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Yes. 
 
Robert Reich: 
Okay, now, wait a minute.  Isn't that an increase -- doesn't that mean a tax increase? 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
No.  I'm not -- I thought we're talking about tax rate increases here.  We've all gone to 
that it's tax rates we're talking about.  Everyone wants to raise taxes by creating 
prosperity, it would be stupid not to. 
 
19:36:50 
 
 
Robert Reich: 
Arthur, Arthur -- 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
We are talking about tax rates here.  At least me.

Mark Zandi: 
Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mark Zandi. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Wait, wait, wait.  The proposition, The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  Taxed.  What we're 
arguing is that we want to raise more tax revenue.  We'd prefer to do it by broadening 
the tax base.  I would love to do it.  Now, we have to look at it from a clear eyed 
perspective.  Can we really -- we've tried, and we've done it once or twice, to broaden 
the base sufficiently, to raise revenue.  But, if we can't, then we raise tax rates.  But 
everyone would agree that we want revenue, and we want to do it through broadening 
the tax base. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's bring in Glenn Hubbard. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Three quick points here.  First of all, there's been some discussion of Bowles-Simpson, 
but I think it's important for everyone to understand the marginal tax -- the top marginal 
rate in the Bowles-Simpson compromise plan is 28 percent.  And that's financed by 
broadening the tax base.  If we have a healthy tax system, the growth that that 
engenders will, in fact, raise revenue, yes, but it's not by raising tax rates.   
 
19:37:52 
 
Second point, in fairness, is the OECD point that I made.  If you look across industrial 
countries, the U.S. actually has, by far, the most progressive tax system.  We rely much 
more on taxes that affect high income individuals that peer countries, and we do so for 
the reason I suggested.  The third point I want to mention, if you add up all the tax 
increases on the rich that are currently being discussed in Washington, it's about 1 
percent of GDP.  The Congressional Budget Office has come up tonight.  They would tell 
you that the long-term problem in Social Security and Medicare alone is on the order of 
10 percentage points of GDP.  Anybody who's selling you that taxes on the rich are going 
to get us out of the fiscal hole doesn't know the math.  
 
Mark Zandi: 
Glenn, just one thing.  Glenn, are you already saying -- Glenn, are you saying that the 
American system, compared to Europe, is more fair than any European tax system? 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
I'm saying it's more progressive, I think it's -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Mark Zandi: 
Is progressive fair? 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
We need a progressive tax system.  The question is, can we balance progressivity and 
growth?  We definitely can. 
 
19:38:57 
 
John Donvan: 
Robert Reich. 
 
Robert Reich: 
Okay.  First of all, the reason that the European tax system looks more progressive than 
ours is because the gap between the rich and the poor in Europe is not nearly as great 
as it in the United States.  We have the highest gap between the rich and the poor. 
 Secondly, Arthur Laffer just admitted something that I hope you heard.  That is that 
when you close loopholes that are taken advantage of, mostly by the rich, you are, in a 
sense, raising their taxes.  They're actually providing more in taxes.  The proposition we 
are debating is whether the rich are taxed enough.  We are saying, Mark and I, that that 
is wrong.  The rich are not taxed enough.  If one way we use to get the rich to pay more 
is to close, for example, the carried interest loophole that allows private equity 
managers to treat their income as capital gains taxed at 15 percent, that means that 
Mitt Romney will be taxed more than he is now. 
 
19:40:05 
 
 
John Donvan: 
Art Laffer. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Come on.  You got tax rate reduction.  If you did tax rate reduction, broaden the base, 
and you created prosperity, of course we all want more revenues, we don't want 
deficits.  I mean, no one wants it.  How do you get it?  The way you get it, by the way, is 
the Reagan, Kennedy, Clinton, and also Harding and Coolidge did in the U.S., lowering 
tax rates and creating prosperity with a broad base.  That's what this proposition is.  The 
tax rates -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Robert Reich: 
-- logical avoidance is going on on that side of the aisle.

John Donvan: 
Actually, I want to put that question to you, Art.   
 
Art Laffer: 
I’m bigger than you are. 
 
Robert Reich: 
But just barely. 
 
John Donvan: 
Robert's point is that closing these loopholes would result in the wealthy paying more of 
their taxes is because they have more access to these loopholes now.  Therefore, their 
taxes would be raised.   
 
19:40:55 
 
Therefore, he's saying that you're actually arguing for their side ending loopholes. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
No, well, that's just not true unless it's a parallel arithmetic because the marginal tax 
rates are coming down at the same time.  So, what you're doing is raising revenue in a 
more efficient way.  Some individuals may pay more.  And, if the economy grows, 
virtually everyone will pay more, and that's just fine.  But, raising marginal tax rates, 
which has been the siren song of the tax debate, is just wrong. 
 
Male Speaker: 
No, can I -- 
 
Art Laffer: 
Do you agree that we should lower tax rates on the rich? 
 
Mark Zandi: 
If we generate tax revenue. 
 
Art Laffer: 
Okay.  I think you just agreed with us. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Can I make a few points -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Yes, Mark Zandi?

Mark Zandi: 
-- in response to some of the points that were made.  First, this is my view.  Glenn, I 
think we need to address spending.  We have to.  I mean, if you look at Simpson-Bowles 
or any proposal that's reasonable, most of the onus of addressing our fiscal problems is 
on the spending side.  So, I'm with you on that.   
 
19:41:53 
 
But, all of these proposals also say we need to generate revenue.  This has got to be a 
shared burden in terms of spending and tax.  So, no disagreement there.  The second 
thing I say is that if we can raise tax revenue by lowering the deductions and credits in 
the tax code -- and there're some very creative ways of doing it.  Marty Feldstein has a 
great proposal.  Both Governor Romney and President Obama have put proposals that 
are not dissimilar in this regard in terms of capping the amount of deductions and 
credits that an individual can take, and that would burden -- in theory, would land on 
higher-income households.  I'm all for that.  But I think it's also important that we do 
this in a way that we're clear-eyed, because -- in a political sense, a political economy 
sense -- because we know it's going to be really hard to scale back those deductions and 
credits in the tax code.   
 
19:42:51 
 
It's -- you know, for every credit and deduction in the code, there is a constituency that 
literally will go to war for it.  So, we know that.  So, in that context, we have to think 
about -- well, maybe we have to raise marginal rates to generate that revenue, to get to 
the point where we're going to address our long-term fiscal problems and -- 
 
John Donvan: 
As a temporary thing, not as a long-term principle of the way -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah, absolutely.  You can't -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's bring in Glenn Hubbard, please. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
You can't do that either in the short-term or the long-term.  So, let's be clear.  The 
current budget has spending full three percentage points higher than traditional levels 
in the country.  It is proposing to raise taxes on high-income people by 1 percent of GDP, 
and we just don't know what happens to the other two.  In the long term, as I've said, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

just Social Security and Medicare alone are 10 times the cost, even of the most 
optimistic tax increases.  So, taxes aren't even an important part of this conversation.   
 
19:43:51 
 
And, to the extent that they are, they would have to follow the European model, which 
is to raise them on everyone, a consumption tax. 
 
John Donvan: 
Robert Reich. 
 
Robert Reich: 
We're getting tangled in a semantic dispute, and I want to be very, very clear about 
what we are actually arguing.  There are two ways of raising revenues.  Almost 
everybody up here agrees, I think, that we've got to raise some revenues.  We may have 
to do a lot of spending reductions as well, but we've got to raise some revenues if we're 
going to deal with the budget deficit problem.  There are two ways of doing it.  One is 
raising marginal income tax rates, and the second is closing loopholes.  Now, the 
question really is when you do one or both of those, are you going to have the rich 
paying more, or is the middle class going to have to pay more, or the poor going to have 
to pay more?  What Mark and I are saying is that when you get more revenue, either by 
closing loopholes or by raising marginal rates, the rich should end up paying more as a 
matter of logic, as a matter of fairness, as a matter of history, as a matter of common 
sense. 
 
19:44:56 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Art Laffer, so your opponent is saying -- this is a debate about -- 
 
[applause] 
 
-- this is a debate about whose hide is it going to come out of, and he's saying it needs to 
come out of the rich's hide. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Let's just talk about it.  Of course you do.  I mean -- and there's nothing wrong with the 
rich paying more in taxes if -- with the prosperity, which is exactly what happened, what 
I showed in the numbers there.  During the Roaring '20s, the rich paid more as a share of 
GDP by lowering rates dramatically.  If you look at the Kennedy period, the rich paid a 
lot more as a share of GDP by lowering rates dramatically.  Under the Reagan/Clinton 
period, the rich paid a lot more by lowering rates dramatically and creating prosperity. 
 That is the dream, and that's where we go.  You cannot balance the budget on the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 -

backs of the unemployed.  You just plain can't.  And that's what you have to do. 
 
John Donvan: 
Robert Reich. 
 
Robert Reich: 
I think that when Arthur Laffer, my dear friend  
 
[laughter] 
 
When you just said -- 
 
John Donvan: 
My friend is kind of a dubious term here -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Robert Reich: 
-- when you just said that it's fine, it's fine for the rich to pay more through closing 
loopholes, I think you just lost -- 
 
19:45:57 
 
[laughter] 
-- the entire debate.  But -- but beyond that, I want to point out, this is an interesting 
historic footnote -- Arthur, you keep going back to the 1920s, the Roaring '20s, there 
were two years over the last century, two years in which the richest Americans took 
home the highest percentage of total income in America.  Those two years were 1928 
and 2007.  Now, does it strike anybody here interesting -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- as a matter of what happens when the rich take home so much of the total income, 
does it strike anybody here that there may be a consequence? 
 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
There may be. 
 
John Donvan: 
But, Robert, how do you relate that to this motion?  Land that on this motion. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Robert Reich: 
I'm sorry? 
 
John Donvan: 
Relate that point to this motion. 
 
Robert Reich: 
The motion should not be voted for.  It's an insane motion. 
 
19:46:55 
 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Can I make one -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
I think you did tonight's grandstanding but you didn't land -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Let me advance the ball just a little bit, and that is -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- it's very important to look at effective tax rates, so that's how much I pay in tax 
relative to the income I earn, not the marginal rates, it's the effective tax rates.  And if 
you look at effective tax rates across the income distribution, and not just income tax 
but you consider the payroll tax, you consider the incidence of corporate tax, excise 
taxes, you know, you roll it all up, this is data, you can go look it up, it's Congressional 
Budget Office data, and they have it over time, it's true that effective tax rates have 
fallen for everybody across the income distribution since the date it begins, 1979, 1980, 
but it's also true that it's fallen very significantly for higher income households.   
 
19:47:55 
 
And, in fact, interesting statistic, for the top 1 percent of earners, the decline in the 
effective tax rate, 1979 to 2010, has declined by more than any other income group, the 
effective tax rate.  So you can argue, and this is often the argument you will hear, that 
the wealthy pay their higher share of total taxes, but the reason is because they're 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

earning so much more income, and their effective tax rate is a lot -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's bring in Glenn Hubbard. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Yeah, again, if you look both at shares of income and shares of taxes paid, the U.S. is the 
most progressive, the CBO, not to get too much into the weeds here, really is not 
attributing the corporation income tax in any way that's really going to change those 
numbers, and on tax reform and growth it is certainly the case that if we broadened the 
base and lowered the rates we would get growth.  Otherwise, why are we going to do 
tax reform?  And that's fine, but that will raise revenue.  But we are not arguing for non-
revenue neutral tax changes.   
 
19:48:53 
 
It's up to you to argue that raising marginal rates, which you've referred to a few times 
this evening, actually is the way to go. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yes. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Robert Reich: 
John, you asked me, "Why is it relevant that in two years, that is, 1928, and 2007, the 
rich took home the highest percentage of total income that they've taken -- 
 
John Donvan: 
That's why it's relevant to the motion. 
 
Robert Reich: 
-- it's relevant to the motion in the following way, because behind this motion is a 
question about the relationship between fairness and economic growth.  That's what we 
are discussing tonight.  And my contention and the contention that I think Mark agrees 
with as well, is that there is not an inconsistency between fairness and economic 
growth.  In fact, the rich would do better with a smaller share of a rapidly growing 
economy than a large share of an economy that's dead in the water.  Why?  Because it's 
dead in the water because the distribution of income is so crazy. 
 
19:49:51

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Male Speaker: 
Yeah, but -- 
 
Robert Reich: 
And that's why -- and that is directly relevant to the point that Arthur and Glenn are 
making, or are attempting to make -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- and are not making actually very well -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
Art Laffer. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
There he was almost nice, but seriously, I mean, the point of it here is "Let's take the 
'20s that you're talking about."  We had those tax cuts.  We had that growth.  We have 
the rich becoming very prosperous.  There's nothing wrong with the rich being rich.  The 
problem is when the poor are poorer.  The dream has always been to make the poor 
rich, and during the '20s, when we had the Roaring '20s, no other country did the tax 
codes we did.  After World War I they all stayed in depression the whole time.  That is 
the key here.  There's nothing wrong with the prosperity we had from the '80s on.  But 
I'll tell you what happened in the 1920s -- and they paid a lot more in taxes. 
 
 
Robert Reich: 
And the exact same thing happened leading up to the crash of 2008, and that is the 
median wages were stuck in the mud, the -- really the growth and the gains from 
growth, went to the top.  What happened?  People in the middle, in order to maintain 
their standard of living, they borrowed, they borrowed, and they borrowed.   
 
19:50:57 
 
And people at the top gambled, and they gambled recklessly.  And those bubbles 
exploded in 1929 and in 2008.  
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Again, a great applause line, but I'm not seeing how this is justifying taxing the rich.  But 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

I want to bring -- Glenn Hubbard. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Mark very helpfully, earlier, referred to a lot of structural problems facing the country. 
 Those are problems that are subjects of another debate, but it is very important to ask 
the question to you, Mark, or to you, Bob, how is it that raising marginal tax rates on 
high income people gets at any of those structural problems?  You referred to 
globalization, there are skill gaps among low income people, I'm not connecting the 
dots, from your tax policy to dealing with the problem that actually should concern 
America. 
 
19:51:52 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah, that's a very good question.  I think it's important that we address the distribution 
of income and wealth, because if we don't, we're going to have the situation that Arthur 
joked about but is very serious.  And that is that the wealthy will capture the system. 
 Art joked about buying a senator, buying a congressman.  I don't think that's a joke.  I 
mean, I think that's a very serious issue.  
 
Robert Reich: 
It's happening. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
And we can't allow that to happen. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Agreed. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
This is the reason why we have to be very, very conscious of this.  We have to have 
enough revenue that goes to the government, to be able to build out the infrastructure 
we need.  We need the revenue to go to the government sufficient to educate the 
population and bring the skill attainment of those workers that are getting creamed by 
China up, so that they can compete in a global economy.  We can't do that unless we 
have sufficient revenue.  Now, we all know revenue is very low, 17 percent of GDP. 
 Since 1980, the revenue to GDP ratio was averaged 19.5 percent.   
 
19:52:53 
 
It's very, very low.  Government spending is high.  I'm all for getting government 
spending down.  I think that's absolutely correct, but we also have to, in a balanced way, 
get revenue up --

John Donvan: 
Mark, can I bring -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Can I make one other point?  I have to make one other point. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sure, yeah. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Because this goes right to Arthur's -- 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Yeah. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
You know, Arthur, you may be right.  You know, you may be right -- 
 
Robert Reich: 
Don't  [unintelligible] me.  We don't have to [unintelligible]. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Mark Zandi: 
This is very important.  You know, you argue lower tax rates improve economic growth, 
all else being equal.  And, you know, I have some sympathy to that argument when 
we're lowering tax rates from 90 percent, which is what they were when Kennedy took 
office and we lowered them to 70.  And Ronald Reagan took them from 70 to 28.  You 
know, the academic literature on this, frankly, is not clear.  There's no proof 
academically, but, okay, I'm sympathetic to the idea.  But what I think is prudent -- if I 
were a prudent planner, and if I was sitting at the ONB or the CBO, I'd say, "You know 
what?  We better -- if we raise taxes or lower tax rates, if we move tax rates, if we move 
tax rates -- we better think about this in an accounting sense, not in, we can generate 
some economic growth and that's going to generate revenue, and, by the way, the kids 
are going to be dancing in the streets and eating chocolate bars.    
 
19:54:04 
 
You know, that's not what we should be doing.  We should be thinking about this in a 
purely accounting -- well, and if it all works out and you're right, that's gravy, we're fine.  
 
Arthur Laffer: 
And it will and I am. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
Glenn Hubbard. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
I think it's important to know that there is actually a lot of work in economics, and 
pretty conclusive about the positive effects of tax reform.  It's one of the few not -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
No one’s arguing tax reform, Glenn.  No one's arguing.  
 
Male Speaker: 
We are. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Lowering rates, broadening the base, that's one of the most fundamental results in 
economics.  And I think the beauty has been -- or the difficultly, the politicians are 
normally scared.  But, frankly, as an economic matter, I don't think it's controversial.  If 
you had the size of government that we had before the financial crisis, the normally 
functioning tax system would, roughly, fund that size of government.   
 
19:54:52 
 
If you'd like, in your description of more for education and more for infrastructure, if 
what you mean is, you'd like a bigger government -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
No. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
I'll come back to the point I made before, you can't fund that on taxing the rich.  That's 
just math. 
 
John Donvan: 
Why not?  Why not? 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Because the -- if you look at all of the tax increases that are currently being proposed, 
and I haven’t heard any politician on the left say they'd like even more, that's about 1 
percent of GDP.  The present budget has an elevated spending level of more than 3 
percent of GDP, and that's before the entitlement programs --  
 
John Donvan: 
But isn't there still a lot of upward room to raise rates on the rich, other than what's 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

proposed now? 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
I think there's a lot of pushback, both from economists, and probably more important, 
from politicians, on the tax increases that are being proposed now.  
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Robert Reich: 
Why is there pushback from politicians on increasing the taxes on the rich or closing 
loopholes that the rich take advantage of, it's because of the increasing political power 
of many of those same rich.   
 
19:55:55 
 
That is the closed system we are dealing with.  That is one of the reasons that you've got 
to start addressing this issue of inequality. 
 
John Donvan: 
Art Laffer. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
These are exactly the problems we had in '86, and that's exactly what we did.  We took 
all of these loopholes and dumped them all, and we got a broader base.  Reagan said he 
would not -- he would veto the bill if it were either tax-raising or tax-lowering.  It was a 
tax reform bill that went across.  We lowered the highest rate from 50 percent to 28 
percent.  And, in the Senate, we got 97 votes, three against us, and all these others 
voted with us.  It was obvious for all those politicians.  And they did it.  It's quite obvious 
right now as well. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
John, can I just -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah, Mark Zandi. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
-- I just want to present some numbers.  These are just accounting.  It comes from 
Simpson-Bowles. 
 
John Donvan: 
Not a ton of numbers. 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Mark Zandi: 
Okay.  It's pretty straight-forward. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Now, under Simpson-Bowles, to achieve something -- what you might call fiscal 
sustainability, that is deficits in the future that are small enough that our debt-to-GDP 
ratio stabilizes, but the --  
 
19:56:56 
 
-- a little bit of arithmetic, we need $3 trillion of deficit reduction over 10 years.  You 
know, we can debate the number, but let's go with it.  Simpson-Bowles would say, 
Dominici-Rivlin would say let's do $2 trillion in government spending, let's get $1 trillion 
in tax revenue, right?  And they would say, "Let's do the tax revenue by broadening the 
base, but if we can't broaden the base, we got to get the revenue from somewhere, 
right?"  And if you do those things then, then -- Glenn -- then the expenditure-to-GDP 
ratio goes to 21 percent -- that's the average since 1980 -- and the revenue-to-GDP goes 
to 19 percent.  That's the average to 1980. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
That's actually -- let me just correct the numbers.  Bowles-Simpson actually would raise -
- 
 
John Donvan: 
Is everybody getting this down? 
 
[laughter] 
 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
This is when economists really get down and dirty. 
 
John Donvan: 
I know, I know.  It's a problem. 
 
Male Speaker: 
The Bowles-Simpson would raise two percentage points of GDP in revenue to fund a 21 
percent government, but it's important again to understand that Bowles-Simpson is 
delivering marginal rates at Reagan-era levels.   



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
19:57:56 
 
There wasn't any discussion in Bowles-Simpson of, "Oh, well, if we can't do this, we'll do 
that."  Bowles-Simpson is a classic broaden the base, lower the rate.  
 
John Donvan: 
Let me pull something out, let me pull something out -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
It's $1 trillion in revenue -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Gentlemen, let me pull something out of the exchange we've just been through and 
bring to Mark Zandi.  Basically, Glenn Hubbard was saying that he understood what your 
aspirations were for funding certain kinds of government programs that would be 
restorative of education, et cetera, and he said that you can't get it from the wealthy, 
that if -- politically, you can't get it, you can't raise rates to that degree for the reason 
that Bob gave because it's a closed loop.  I want to know economically could you get it, 
because their argument is that economically you can't because the behavior of the 
wealthy would change in such a way that they just wouldn't -- they wouldn't participate. 
 Number one, they wouldn't participate -- they would move their money offshore, and 
they wouldn't invest here.  And that's kind of the core of their argument.  Can you take 
that on? 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah.  I mean, I don't think that -- first of all, I think the best way of approaching this is 
broadening the tax base.   
 
19:58:56 
 
That's -- I'm on board with that.  But if we have to go down -- if we can't raise the 
revenue, the trillion in revenue through tax broadening, I'm all for raising marginal rates. 
 But, when I talk about raising marginal rates, I'm talking about putting them back to the 
era when this fellow was labor secretary and generating 22 million jobs.  I'm talking 
about 35 percent today to 39.6 percent on personal income.  And you can -- we can talk 
about cap gains and dividend income and so forth and Obamacare and health care tax, 
all those kinds of things --those kinds of things will generate a trillion in revenue.  And I 
don't think -- and, again, this is my view, experience -- I don't thinkthe American wealthy 
are going to move offshore and not pay their taxes. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Robert Reich: 
We know that they aren't.  We know that they aren't because there have been a 
number of experiments.  One experiment is an experiment that we ran in this country 
between 1946 and 1981 when tax rates, as I said before -- officially, marginal tax rates 
were at least 70 percent, and the effective rate after deductions and tax credits was 
about 54, 55, 56 percent.   
 
20:00:04 
 
Maybe it was slightly more difficult then to move abroad or shift your money abroad, 
that's true, but also legally we could have then, as we can now, make it very difficult to 
do that.  The real issue here -- and, Glenn, what you keep on wanting to do, and Art, you 
do too -- is you are saying in effect we ought to broaden the base and not raise marginal 
rates. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Lower.  [unintelligible] 
 
Robert Reich: 
And what you -- yeah, and what you're hearing from us is we're happy to do whatever 
you want to do to raise revenues, that is close the loopholes or raise the rates -- as long 
as most of those revenues come from the people who are best situated to bear the 
burden, and that is the rich who are richer now than they've ever been as a proportion 
of total income.   
 
20:00:54 
 
Now, if you agree with us, then this proposition -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
Robert Reich: 
-- you have to vote against-- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to let Glenn Hubbard respond to that, but I -- right after his answer, I'm going to 
come to you for questions so prepare terse focused questions on this motion, and we'll 
be delighted to have you participate.  Glenn Hubbard.

Glenn Hubbard: 
Three quick points, first of all, again -- 
 
John Donvan: 
You don’t have to be that quick.  He was pretty -- 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Yeah, well, what Art and I are arguing is to the extent that revenues come from faster 
growth from a reform system, we're fine for that.  You keep moving the goalposts, but 
you're talking about marginal rates and not that.  Second, there are significant real 
effects of raising taxes on business owners.  There's a huge body of research out there. 
 You might not like it, but it is there.  And the third -- the question to you about your 
aspirations, again, Social Security and Medicare, these two programs are on track to rise 
10 percentage points of GDP.   
 
20:01:52 
 
Now, if you want to tax, finance that, you mentioned that a healthy -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
I don't. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
-- healthy revenue share in GDP is 19 percent, you'd have to raise every tax -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Mark Zandi: 
It's a red herring.  It's a red herring.  I don't. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
You can't get there from here.  
 
Mark Zandi: 
I agree with you.  We need entitlement reform and we need spending cuts.  I'm on 
board with that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's go to some questions from the audience.  And, sir, right down -- yeah, right there, 
yeah.  And if you wait for a pause so the camera can find you, and it would help actually 
if you could step out to your left just so that you're bright -- in the brighter light, and let

us know your name and really a good question. 
 
Male Speaker: 
[inaudible] I’m from Columbia Business School, [inaudible], the question is for Mr. 
Laffer. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Hey, hey, hey, is this fair? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
We're everywhere. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Wait till you hear the question. 
 
[laughter] 
 
My question is to Mr. Laffer, he just took the example of Warren Buffett, who's on a 
stated income of 40 million paid 7 million in taxes, whereas you think his income was 12 
billion.   
 
20:02:57 
 
So if whichever way, the loopholes are closed or the rates increase, don't you think the 
rich man should be paying more and, therefore, don't you think this motion -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Warren is a Columbia Business School graduate. That’s how you answer this question. 
 
John Donvan: 
Art Laffer, take that question. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
But let me answer two things, there are two ways of raising revenues.  One is to 
broaden the base and one is to lower rates, not raise them.  And that is the way to get 
your prosperity.  As you looked at every time, you go back to the Kennedy period where 
rates were much higher and all that, when Kennedy lowered those rates, guess what 
happened to revenues?  They went up as a share of GDP, not down from the top 1 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

percent of income earners.  Not only did those revenues go up, but there were 
secondary and tertiary rate -- revenues going in, for the jobs that they created the 
output, the employment, the production, all of that.  They're huge revenue raisers.   
 
20:03:51 
 
That is not true of any other income group.  It's not.  You raise tax rates on the poor or 
the middle income and you collect more revenues, but not on the rich.  You want more 
revenues from the rich, which I do, what you do is you broaden the base and you lower 
the rates, and both of those will bring you more revenue, period. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
How low would you lower them?  How low would you go? 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Well, it doesn't go to zero, let's put it there. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
[unintelligible] to zero? 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
I will stipulate today -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Bowles-Simpson seems that 28 percent -- 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Yeah. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
-- seems like a good place. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
And, you know, we did an '86 down to 28 percent.  That's a good number, or leave it 
where it is. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Why not lower, though? 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
How about -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Why not? 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
You could maybe go lower. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
I’m asking you Art.  Why not 15 percent? 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
If you broaden the base enough -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Why not 10?  Why not 5? 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
-- if you were -- I mean, I will -- none of you guys will agree with me here, but if you 
taxes unrealized capital gains and raise the bases, you could get it really low.  If you 
wouldn't allow all the 501c3s and have football tickets at Oklahoma, be tax exempt, I 
think you'd get it really low.  There's a huge amount of income out there that is not 
taxed at all, that.   
 
20:04:52 
 
And then you lower the rate like I did with Gerry Brown -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
And I want to go to another question.  Rob Reich. 
 
Robert Reich: 
The question before the House is not, "Do you broaden the base?  And do you raise or 
lower marginal rates?"  The question is, should the rich pay more or are the rich taxed 
enough?  Now, let's take an example.  Take the mortgage interest deduction, which is 
the most sacred of sacred cows.  Now, here is what we know about the mortgage 
interest deduction.  Mortgage interest deduction is essentially a subsidy for housing, but 
who gets the lion's share of the benefit of the mortgage interest deduction?  Well, 
here's what we know, that four times more of that subsidy goes to the top 20 percent of 
Americans, than the total amount of public housing assistance that goes to the bottom 
20 percent of Americans.  So why not limit the total mortgage interest deduction per 
year, to something like, let's say, $10,000 per year.   
 
20:05:55 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Why not limit other deductions to, say, a total of $10,000 or $12,000 a year.  You -- if 
you do that, you are increasing revenues from the rich.  If you do that, you are actually 
voting against the proposition. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I want to go to another question, but, first, I want to remind you that we are in 
the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I'm John 
Donvan, your moderator.  We have two teams of two who are arguing it out over this 
motion: The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  Another question from the audience.  Right down 
the front here. 
 
Female Speaker: 
I'm Jackie Hotlier [spelled phonetically].  I wanted to direct this question to you guys, 
with respect to -- 
 
John Donvan: 
You want to address to the side arguing against the motion? 
 
Female Speaker: 
Yes, the con side.  I wanted to know what you guys think about small businesses, are 
they really going to be affected if the tax rate increases? 
 
20:06:53 
 
Robert Reich: 
I love small businesses. 
 
[laughter] 
 
My father was a small businessman.  He was small and he was a small businessman. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But, look, if we, for example, as a nation decide that next year we are going to continue 
the Bush tax cuts for people earning under $250,000, but the income over $250,000 is 
going to go back to the Clinton kind of rates, is that going to be such a huge burden for 
small businesses?  Well, only about 2 to 3 percent of the small businesses earn over 
$250,000.  And we're only talking about that amount of income over $250,000, so a 
small businessperson who earns $251,000 that year is only going to be paying the 
Clinton rate on $1,000 of income.  And, by the way, that Clinton rate was not so 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

onerous; small businesses did much better under Bill Clinton than they've doing recently 
over the last 10 years. 
 
20:07:58 
 
John Donvan: 
Glenn Hubbard. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
The reference to small numbers, small businesses being at the top misses the fact that 
about half of the people in the top 1 percent are business owners.  And, if you look at 
the calculation that I made for you, if you compare what's going to happen to 
investment and hiring by those individuals as they're paying taxes at individual rates, 
you're looking at changes on the order of 50 percent in investment, 14 percent in hiring, 
in an era when the economy is struggling.  You know, there's a reason the president 
took a pass on raising marginal rates the last time.  
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, another question. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
John, can I? 
 
John Donvan: 
Oh, sure.  Mark Zandi. 
 
[applause] 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Just to reinforce the point, this is why I told you my story about being the egghead 
entrepreneur, because I was an S chapter corporation, I was one of those of folks in the 
top 3 percent.   
 
20:08:50 
 
And my experience says, no, it doesn't matter.  I'm driven by lots of other things and 
raising marginal rates from 35 to 40 or 45, it's not going to make a difference in terms of 
my thinking.  So, no.  My experience -- and I don't think the data suggests that this is 
going to have a significant impact.  One other thing about small business that I just think 
it's very important to point out, that most small businesses are proprietorships, they're 
professionals like doctors and dentists, plumbers, electricians, they're not making 
$250,000, they're not going to be affected by this.  The folks that are going to be 
affected by this are, you know, they're hedge fund owners, they're different kinds of 
small businesses that, they're motivated by different things.  So when people talk about 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 45 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

small business, they have some -- they're thinking about something totally different 
than the folks that will be affected by the higher marginal rates that we're talking about 
here. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Ma’am.  Thanks.  Could you stand up?  Thank you.  Just so we can you with the 
camera. 
 
Female Speaker: 
If it was up to me -- 
 
John Donvan: 
And would you mind telling us your name, also? 
 
20:09:56 
 
Female Speaker: 
My name is Reba Shemanski [spelled phonetically].  If it was up to me, I'd love the 
marginal tax rate to go back to 91 percent; however, most wealthy people don't pay the 
marginal tax rate, they get paid in capital gains or carried interests, like your guy, Mitt 
Romney.  Therefore, don't you feel that the capital gains tax -- 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Actually, he gets dividends, but that’s okay-- 
 
Female Speaker: 
Don't you think -- please let me finish.  Don't you think the capital gains tax should equal 
the marginal tax rate?  And doesn't Mitt Romney feel guilty that he pays the same -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, all right, all right.  You've just disqualified yourself.  I'm going to take another 
question, because we're not playing it that way.  Sir, right there. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Goldberg: 
My name is John Goldberg.  The question is to Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Laffer.  How much 
do you think that the social contract sort of justice or moral element should play into 
the conversation?   
 
20:11:01 
 
And, to be specific, at one of the debates Mr. Romney said that he still wants the top 5 
percent to pay 60 percent of collections.  Do you think that is the right number?  Should 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

it not go up from there?  Which is, I think -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Do you mind -- and there reason I say this is that this debate will, we hope, will live on 
for months and be heard -- to rephrase your question without actually needing to make 
the reference to the recent debate, because I think you can and it would let us use this 
question. 
 
John Goldberg: 
Okay. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thanks. 
 
John Goldberg: 
So, the question is, I guess, I've heard that the top 5 percent of these earners -- 
[laughter] 
 
[applause] 
 
-- produce 60 percent of the collections.  Do you think that's about the right number? 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
There's no question from a tax fairness or social justice point of view that we need a 
progressive tax system.   
 
20:11:59 
 
The wealthy in our society should pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden, and I 
don't think any serious -- at least economist -- has suggested otherwise.  But, to me, 
there's a strong element of social justice that's forgotten in that conversation, and this 
goes back to the conversation Mark and I were having earlier.  We really need a society 
that helps put people back on the ladder, and that's not a discussion of whose marginal 
tax rate is X or Y, but a discussion of how as a country we're going to help those people 
succeed.  That's the social justice. 
 
John Donvan: 
Bob Reich. 
 
Robert Reich: 
But I think that -- I think Glenn-- 
 
[applause] 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
-- here I want to use the opportunity I have, we have, to agree.  You're exactly right, 
Glenn.  We want an economy and a society that enables everybody to have an 
opportunity to make the most of themselves and to go up that ladder.  But, as the gap 
grows, what we are finding is that upward mobility in America is slowing.   
 
20:13:01 
 
In fact, relative to places like Canada, we have a much slower degree of upward 
mobility.  The chances that a poor kid is going to be a poor adult is greater in the United 
States than it is -- not only in Canada, but greater than in Germany, greater than in most 
of Europe, greater than in every place in rich nations other than Britain and Italy. 
 
John Donvan: 
Is it tax-related, this -- 
 
Robert Reich: 
It is tax-related, of course it's tax-related, because if we didn't have the problem of 
upward mobility, that is, if people could easily move upward, than the issue of 
inequality and the moral essence of what we are talking about would not be as difficult. 
 
John Donvan: 
But is the tax system a solution?  Is it -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Robert Reich: 
The reason that this proposition is ludicrous and why everybody should vote against it is 
because we have a system right now where the dice are loaded.   
 
20:13:55 
 
They're loaded in favor of people who -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But are you arguing to use the tax system to unload the dice? 
 
Robert Reich: 
Well, two ways.  Now, Mark said before -- and I think it's a very important point -- that if 
we are going to have enough revenues to ensure that every child in America has an 
adequate education, not only K through 12, but hopefully early childhood education, 
hopefully access to a good public university or even private university -- if education is 
going to be back to where it was in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s in terms of quality for every 
young child, that is going to take, whether we want it or not, that's going to take some 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

money to do.  And if the rich are not going to pitch in, we are not going to be able to do 
it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Glenn Hubbard. 
 
[applause] 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
First of all, it's useful to know that the tax system in the U.S. does actually lean against in 
a very powerful way some of the forces that Bob and Mark have mentioned.   
 
20:14:51 
 
I've already mentioned that in the context of the OECD.  It's also the case, though, that 
there's a pretty poor link between changing marginal tax rates at the top and 
accomplishing much of any of this.  It's really a question of setting priorities in 
government.  Do we want to be a country that has a few entitlement programs that 
have all of our spending dollars, or do we want to invest in the future?  That's a very 
legitimate discussion, but it has nothing to do with taxing the rich. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mark Zandi. 
 
[applause] 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah, I -- I want to get to a point that Glenn has been making, and it's a reasonable one. 
 The tax code does help reduce the skewing of the distribution of income and wealth.  If 
you look at the so-called Gini Coefficient -- another -- I'm sorry, but this is very easy.  So, 
Gini Coefficient, best way to measure the income distribution.  If it's zero, you've got 
everyone getting the same income.  If it's 1, that's bad.  One person's getting all the 
income.  So, the Gini Coefficient pre-tax is -- back in 1980 was .38.  Today it's .48.   
 
20:15:55 
 
So that means the distribution of income is getting wider.  Take the tax code, run it 
through, calculate the Gini Coefficient, we now go from .34 to .44.  So, yeah, it did, in 
fact, reduce the skewing of the distribution of income and wealth, but the point is the 
skewing is still very significant and getting wider by the day.  And this is a very significant 
problem.  Our Tax Code really hasn't helped with that issue.   
 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

But put differently, the skewing is a pretax phenomenon.  It relates to real phenomena 
out there in the world, and we can address those phenomena –  
 
 
Mark Zandi: 
This is my point, this is the key point -- we have a fiscal problem, we have to address the 
fiscal problem, we have to do that by looking -- addressing the fiscal problem through 
the prism of what it means for the distribution of income and wealth.  We cannot ignore 
that.  When we think about government spending, and government spending cutbacks, 
and tax revenue, we have to think about it in the context of tax revenue. 
 
20:16:55 
 
Art Laffer: 
But you got to think of it in dynamic terms.  That's what you've got to do is what it does 
to the growth path, what it does to the poverty, unemployment.  Never before have so 
many people been so unemployed as they are amongst the poor, amongst the 
minorities.  You know, it's just shocking, what's happening today because of the growth 
being lost.  We've got to achieve the income distribution we want and the prosperity -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
-- through growth. 
 
John Donvan: 
Arthur, I have a tweeted question from a Josh Wolinsky, who is asking about trading off 
the capital gains tax versus the income tax.  And he's basically saying, "Should rates be 
lowered -- should rates be raised on income that comes from buying and selling stuff 
versus lowered on people who actually make stuff for a living?" 
 
[laughter] 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Well, my view is it should be flat rate across the board, just the way it was -- we raised 
capital gains tax rate in 1986 from 20 to 28 percent.   
 
20:17:51 
 
We made it the same as every other.  I think that's the way you should go.  I think you 
should get it so that all forms of income are the same.

Glenn Hubbard: 
Okay, that's not the view of the rest of the table, just so there's no misconception. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
But that's true.  I am truly for a flat tax across the board, and get the hell out of the way, 
and let people produce -- 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
The optimal tax on savings is zero. 
 
[applause] 
 
Carl Pope: 
I’m Carl Pope and Dr. Hubbard I sense a deal, and I want to offer you the deal, but I 
think the other side would take, but I'm not certain you would.  The four of you together 
come up with $2 trillion in cuts, you each have $500 billion, but you come up with $2 
trillion together, you and Dr. Laffer then have to come up with some package of your 
choosing, unhampered by politics, of a trillion dollars from cutting marginal rates, 
closing loopholes, whatever you like, with the sole condition being that the trillion 
dollars has to be paid by the upper 1 percent and then -- 
 
20:18:53 
 
John Donvan: 
I need you to zoom in for a landing here. 
 
Carl Pope: 
Okay.  And -- 
[laughter] 
-- all of the additional revenues which result from Dr. Laffer's anticipated growth, if you 
do it right, the four of you each get to spend a quarter of it either on the deficit or more 
federal spending. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay -- 
 
Carl Pope: 
But would you take that deal? 
 
John Donvan: 
I didn't understand your question. 
 
[laughter] 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Glenn Hubbard: 
Well, if I understand the question-- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
--then I can give a pretty simple answer to it.  There's a recent study that Harvey Rosen, 
who's a professor at Princeton, has done, it is possible to lower marginal tax rates 
substantially, broaden the base, get down to a 28 percent rate, with the growth, still 
have the high income people pay exactly the same tax share, that is, the money is 
coming from them, if that was your question, that's the answer. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Robert Reich: 
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
 
John Donvan: 
Everybody got the question but me-- 
 
[laughter] 
 
Robert Reich: 
It's getting close to the core of the issue. 
 
20:19:50 
 
John Donvan: 
[unintelligible] 
 
Robert Reich: 
The issue is not broadening the tax base and lowering the rates so the wealthy pay the 
same as they're paying now.  
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
The question is shouldn't the wealthy be paying a larger share?  And what Mark and I 
have been arguing is that you have got to.  If you are talking about getting the deficit 
down, reducing the debt, not only do you have to cut federal spending, you also have to 
rely on some net increase in revenues.  And that net increase in revenues we believe 
should come primarily -- whether it's base broadening or rate increasing it should come 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

primarily from the wealthy.  And if you agree with us, then you think this proposition is 
wrong.  
 
[laughter] 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Let me just say -- 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
You've moved the goalpost several times tonight, but it is the case that -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
John Donvan: 
[unintelligible] in the middle here.  Gentleman in the -- a blue necktie.  Thank you. 
 
20:20:47 
 
Phil Melville: 
Thank you.  My name is Phil Melville [spelled phonetically].  A question, broadly, for the 
group.  I think you all believe growth is good, but I would like to understand that -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
I'm not sure about Art on that one. 
 
Phil Melville: 
But the IMF recently put out a paper talking about multipliers, that tax increases have a 
great impact on the economy than spending cuts.  Do you believe that's true?  And, if 
so, particularly to Mr. Zandi, why would you advocate increasing taxes when it'd have a 
disproportionate effect on the economy? 
 
John Donvan: 
Mark Zandi. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Well, to be clear and just to repeat myself, I'm all for raising tax revenue from 
broadening the tax base.  I would prefer not to raise tax rates on anybody, I'd like to 
even cut them.  And, in fact, if we broaden the base enough, Art's right, we can lower 
the tax rates and generate revenue, and that has to come from higher income 
households.  So let's just make that very clear.  Now, if we're debating the impacts of 
taxes and spending, it's just the opposite.  I mean, my view is, the spending multipliers 
are larger than the tax multipliers, in general, on average.   
 
20:21:58 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 53 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
You know, it depends on the situation, the tax, and the spending, so forth and so on. 
 But, you know, on average that's the case.  Spending multipliers are larger.  Now -- but 
you've heard me before say, I think most of the onus of deficit reduction and achieving 
fiscal sustainability has to be on the spending cuts, because if you look, again, at current 
spending and current revenue, it's mostly the spending that's out of line, relative to our 
historical norms.  And we have to get the spending down.  And -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's let Glenn Hubbard -- 
 
Mark Zandi: 
And Glenn is right, in the longer run, 10, 20, 30 years, we have to address our 
entitlement programs.  That's what's going to kill us.  But we could also -- and I'll end 
here -- we also should do that through the prism of what it means for the distribution of 
income and wealth. 
 
John Donvan: 
Glenn Hubbard. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
I like your question a lot, because sometimes we slip into the use of a word like deficit, 
which is an accounting term, when what we really mean is taxes and spending.   
 
20:22:55 
 
Now, your question gets to the core of why it's important to separate those two parts. 
 There's a big difference between changing the path of fiscal policy by raising taxes and 
cutting spending.  And I think the bulk of the evidence would suggest, yes, that the tax 
increase way would be more costly on the multipliers.  I'll tout my intermediate macro 
textbook, you can turn to the table of multipliers and you'll see that point pretty much 
from the literature. 
 
John Donvan: 
One more question, sir. 
 
Van Greenfield: 
Hi, Van Greenfield.  When I listen to all these numbers, I'm kind of reminded of, I guess 
it was Twain, we have liars, damned liars, and statistics.  And it seems like, probably 
either of you could argue the other person's point.  But the question I have is really to 
the con side, and that is, it seems to me the fundamental question was raised by Glenn 
at the beginning, which is, what is the size of government that you want?

And I'd like to, kind of, move the debate, or move the question, back to what Bob was 
originally talking about, I think, when he was talking about sufficiency and fairness -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I need -- I'm sorry, I need you to repeat the question. 
 
Van Greenfield: 
What is your position on the fundamental question that Glenn raised, which is, the real 
issue is the size of government, in terms of fairness -- 
 
John Donvan: 
I'm going to pass on that because that's not the issue that we're actually -- I understand 
that it's related, and I understand it was sandwiched into your argument, but I really 
want to have a question that provokes more of an understanding of this issue of whose 
hide is the money supposed to come out of.  Ma'am, right in the middle there.  Thank 
you, with respect.  You need a microphone to come to you. 
 
Female Speaker: 
I think I'm okay. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no.  The radio needs the microphone.  You'll sound like a voice off in the distance 
and people will wonder what's wrong with that woman. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Female Speaker: 
My name is [unintelligible], and I'd like to know who's the broader base?  What is 
encompassed in this broadening base that we keep talking about? 
 
20:25:02 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Art Laffer. 
 
Robert Reich: 
That's a great question.  That's exactly -- 
 
[applause] 
That's exactly what we have been debating, and you can broaden --

John Donvan: 
It's Art Laffer's turn to talk. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
My turn?  
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
And it will be your turn right after that, Robert. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
I did Jerry Brown's flat tax when he ran for president in 1992, we got rid of all federal 
taxes.  You should look at every tax, not just income taxes.  We got rid of the income 
taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, employer and employee; we got rid of excise taxes, 
capital gains, estate taxes, tariffs.  And the only ones we left were sin taxes, which are 
really small.  And, in there, said we had two flat rates, one of business net sales, value 
added, and one on personal unadjusted gross income.  If you did that at full 
employment, you could have a flat tax rate of 11.8 percent and have it statically 
revenue-neutral, that's it.  You end up -- 
 
20:25:53 
 
John Donvan: 
So who's in the -- 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
-- [unintelligible] -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Who's in the base that's been broadened? 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Everyone's in the base.  They're all forms, where you tax Warren Buffett on his $12 
billion income that year, not on $40 million, which is what he had in his AGI after all the 
legal tax deductions. 
 
John Donvan: 
But the mom living on $20,000 who needs to buy her cigarettes would also -- 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
What? 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 56 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
The mom living on $20,000 with four kids who wants to buy cigarettes -- 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Yeah, but she'd have a job.  That's the whole point.  Come on. 
 
John Donvan: 
Bob Reich. 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
I don't mind her paying for her cigarettes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Bob Reich. 
 
Robert Reich: 
I want to talk to your question, because much of this debate has been about exactly 
that.  What do we mean when we talk about broadening the base?  And the reality is 
that average Americans, most people -- when they fill out their income taxes, they don't 
itemize their deductions.  The wealthy have a lot of itemized deductions.  They take -- I 
have a lot of tax credits.   
 
20:26:52 
 
They use a lot of -- accountants and tax planners who are taking advantage of every 
single possibility.  So, if you are broadening the base in such a way that you are closing 
some of those opportunities for tax avoidance or tax mitigation, and the net effect is 
that the wealthy end up paying more than they were paying before, then you are 
increasing their taxes, and they are, in a sense, generating more revenues.  And, if you 
support that, you don't support tonight's proposition. 
 
John Donvan: 
Glenn Hubbard, I need you to be terse, because we're out of time. 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Yeah, basically, just to try to really answer your question.  There are two things that are 
on the table being discussed, I think, by tax reformers.  One would be some sort of cap 
on deductions -- that could be a dollar, that could be a percentage of your income. 
 Another would be an approach Bowles-Simpson took, which really cut back a lot on the 
deductions of affluent people, but left the more in place for moderate income people.   
 
20:27:55 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 57 -

Either one of those would get you there. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Can I say just -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right -- very -- you've got 10 seconds. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Yeah, really important question, because you have to really think about what we're 
talking about here.  Mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving, state and local 
income taxes, property taxes, you get deductions for education -- 
 
John Donvan: 
One second. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
-- medical care, all kinds of -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Mark, I have to interrupt you. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
And that's why it's so difficult to do it. 
 
Male Speaker: 
But you're cutting rates at the same time. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Round 2 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
And now we go on to Round 3.  Round 3.  Closing statements by each debater in turn. 
 They will be two minutes each.  It is their last chance to try to change your mind before 
you vote for the second time and choose the winner of this debate.  Our motion is The 
Rich Are Taxed Enough.  And here to summarize his position against the motion, Robert 
Reich.  He is a professor at UC Berkeley and former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton 
administration.

Let's make that an applause line.  That would be nice. 
 
[applause] 
 
No, no, no, no, no.  I have to be saying it as -- there needs to be some overlap, so let's do 
that again. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Thank you for your patience on this.  I'm the one who messed it up, not you. 
 Summarizing his position against the motion, Robert Reich, professor at UC Berkeley 
and former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. 
 
[applause] 
 
Robert Reich: 
Well, this has been a great debate, and Glenn -- I've enjoyed enormously listening to you 
and trying to respond to you and besting your arguments. 
 
[laughter] 
 
And Arthur Laffer, you are a dear, old friend, and you are as wrong as you always have 
been.  
 
[laughter] 
 
And Mark Zandi, you are brilliant. 
 
[laughter] 
 
20:29:47 
 
But let me just say, I think that if you look at the proposition here that we are debating 
tonight, the proposition is simply that the rich are taxed enough, and what Mark and I 
have been saying, whether you couch it in terms of closing loopholes, broadening the 
base, increasing marginal income taxes, doesn't matter how you cook it, the still of the 
question is given that we have a huge budget deficit, somebody has got to pay a little bit 
more, even if you do a huge amount of cutting of the budget  and cutting spending, you 
still are going to have to raise some revenues.  No matter what your ideology is, you're 
still going to have to raise some revenues.  And if you believe, as I do and as Mark does, 
that the rich should bear the lion's share of that revenue raising, then you've got to, 
please, for the good of your children and your grandchildren --

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
[laughter] 
 
For the good of America, as solid patriots, you have got to vote against this proposition, 
because it is, in its entirety, given where we are in this country right now, given the 
challenges we face, this proposition is simply and unalterably ludicrous. 
 
20:31:05 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Robert Reich. 
 
Robert Reich: 
Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Our motion is: The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  And here to summarize his position in 
support of the motion is Glenn Hubbard.  He is the dean of Columbia Business School 
and economic advisor to Mitt Romney. 
 
[applause] 
 
Glenn Hubbard: 
Thank you.   You know, just as Oliver Wendell Holmes famously observed, that paying 
taxes is actually the price we pay for living in a civilized society.  And a civilized society 
defends itself, it educates its citizens, it cares for those in need, but it's also got to be a 
society of opportunity and growth, a society of entrepreneurs and businesses, of seeing 
the fruits of one's own investment in time and in talents, of encouraging investment for 
tomorrow and not just consumption for today.   
 
20:31:54 
 
Tonight Art and I have argued that confiscatory success taxes are wrongheaded, but 
they're also wrong.  I'd ask two questions of our partners tonight.  First, what evidence 
suggests that the economic consequences of higher tax rates on the successful could 
improve the employment or the income prospects of the rest?  And, second, is the 
nation better off by raising tax rates on high income people or by balancing fairness and 
prosperity, asking sacrifice from the affluent through the growth consequences of tax 
reform, and reforming our spending programs to be a safety net?  The question at hand 
tonight is a broad one and an important one.  This country has long identified with 
equality of opportunity.  And I worry a lot right now in our country about economic 
opportunity.

20:32:50 
 
I'm fond of an example that illustrates my worry with an image of the nation as a tall 
building with the bottom flooded out, the penthouse doing fine, and the elevator 
broken.  We could throw rocks at the top or we could fix the elevator.  I think most 
Americans make the latter choice viscerally.  And to the points Art and I have made 
tonight, throwing rocks doesn't fix the elevator, and to torture the analogy, can't pay for 
it.  We need to think about growth and fairness.  The case for the proposition tonight is 
very strong.  Tax rates should not rise.  The rich are taxed enough. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Glenn Hubbard. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our motion: The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  And here to summarize his position against 
the motion, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics. 
 
Mark Zandi: 
Well, John, I think -- 
 
[applause] 
 
-- thank you.  John, I want to thank you for moderating a great debate.  And I really do 
want to thank Glenn and Art for being good counterweights here.  And, Bob, thanks for 
that great comment.   
 
20:33:50 
 
Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Take that with me.  And you're a great guy, too, by the 
way. 
 
[laughter] 
 
Hey, you know, I actually am cheered by our conversation.  It sounds like we were 
hitting each other over the head.  To some degree we were mostly about hitting Art 
over the head. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But I think there's a lot of commonality here.  I think there's a lot of agreement.  I think 
we agree that our fiscal problems need to be addressed, that these are key to our long 
term economic success.  I think we agree that the distribution of income and wealth is a 
problem, you know, we're debating a little bit about how we should approach that.  But 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 61 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

I think we view that as a problem.  I think we agree that to address these problems that 
we do need to cut back on future government spending, that the entitlement programs 
do need reform, and we do need to think about it in the context of who's going to pay 
for that reform.  The burden of that should probably fall on higher income households.   
 
20:34:54 
 
And we agree that we need to generate -- we have to think about the tax side of this. 
 We have to focus on this.  But here's where we disagree and that is that we -- Bob and I 
believe that we need to raise tax revenue, that this has to be a balanced approach to 
getting us back to something that we would consider appropriate and normal.  And I 
would love to do it through closing deductions and loopholes in the tax code.  I think 
that would be the best way to do it, but we need to be clear eyed about this.  And if we 
can't do it in the way you would like and I would like, we still need to raise the revenue, 
and we need to raise the revenue by taxing the rich.  So you have to vote against this 
proposition.  The rich are not taxed enough. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mark Zandi. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that is our motion: The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  And here to make his closing 
statement in support of the motion, Art Laffer.  He is founder and chairman of Laffer 
Associates and Laffer Investments.  
 
20:35:55 
[applause] 
 
Arthur Laffer: 
Thank you.  First of all, I'd like to congratulate Bob and Mark for trying to change the 
proposition to get a different one.  The question is tax rates and, frankly, what Glenn 
have been arguing are, why would you ever want to raise tax rates on the rich if you 
know it's going to give you less revenue and a less prosperous economy?  It's as simple 
as that and the evidence out there documents that time and time again.  One of the 
ways I would do is lowering tax rates, but doing it by broadening the tax base to keep 
revenue neutral but creating the growth, prosperity, which would give higher revenues, 
but with lower rates.  If you believe in lower rates and a broader base, you must vote for 
the proposition that the rich are taxed enough.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Art Laffer.  And that concludes our closing statements.

20:36:51 
 
And now it is time to learn which side you feel argued best.  We're going to ask you 
again for your second vote, to go to the keypad at each of your seats.  Our motion is: 
The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  At this point, if you agree with that motion after everything 
you've heard, push number one on your keypad.  If you disagree, push number two.  If 
you are, became, remain, undecided, push number three.  And we will have the results 
in about a minute and a half.  I think the system is still open so, has anybody not voted? 
 Everybody's good.  All right.  While we're waiting for those results to come, the first 
thing I want to say is that this was a really, really, real pleasure to listen to this debate. 
 The way the four of you brought your game to this, a lot of humor, a lot of respect, 
actually, for one another.  It's what we like to do, and I want to thank all of you for doing 
it. 
 
[applause] 
 
I'd also like to thank everybody who got up to ask a question, including the questions 
that didn't get used.   
 
20:37:55 
 
It takes a lot of nerve to get up and do it.  And some of the questions were brilliant and 
on targets.  And the others were just darn interesting. 
 
[laughter] 
 
No, seriously, just not exactly where we wanted to take the discussion tonight.  So 
everybody who got up and asked questions, thanks very much.  Give them a round of 
applause. 
 
[applause] 
 
And, finally, in terms of thanks, we want to thank, again, the Richmond Center for their 
participation tonight and in making all of this possible.  Thank you to them. 
 
[applause] 
 
We encourage you to talk about this debate; talk to your friends, tweet about it, blog 
about it.  Our twitter handle is @IQ2US.  The hashtag is actually #taxdebate.  I think 
earlier I said our hashtag was #IQ2US, that would work, too, but #taxdebate is what 
we're looking for tonight.  We have our next debate coming up next month, it will be on 
November 14.

The motion, the proposition, that we will be arguing is Legalize Drugs.  For the motion, 
we have Paul Butler.  He is a professor at Georgetown Law School; he is also a former 
federal prosecutor.  His partner is Nick Gillespie -- he is one of America's foremost 
libertarians, and he is also editor in Chief of reason.com and Reason TV.  Against the 
motion, Theodore Dalrymple.  He is a retired prison doctor and a fellow at the 
Manhattan Institute.  And Asa Hutchinson, who is a former administrator of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration and the first undersecretary of the Department of 
Homeland Security.  We have tickets for that debate on November 14 and for our 
December 5 debate, which is Science Refutes God, available on our website.  The 
website is www.iq2us.org.  We would love to see all of you and we were delighted that 
we sold out and we love selling out, so help us do that.  Well, that doesn't sound right.   
 
20:39:51 
 
Don't -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
We don't want to sell out.  We would like to sell all of our tickets.  
 
[laughter] 
 
If you can't be in the audience for any of those upcoming debates, and also if you want 
to see this one again, there are a lot of ways that you can catch this one and the 
upcoming ones.  We have a livestream on FORA.tv and then the debate lives on that site 
for some time.  You can also, as I said earlier, listen to these debates on NPR, that's 
WNYC right here in New York City.  Or watch them on WNET and the World Digital 
channel.  Okay.  So, you have listened to the arguments for and against on this motion: 
The Rich Are Taxed Enough.  We had you vote once before the debate and once again 
afterwards on where you stand on this motion.  Here are the results.  The teams whose 
numbers will have changed the most will be declared our winner.  Before the debate 28 
percent were for the motion, 49 percent against, and 23 percent undecided.  After the 
debate, 30 percent are for the motion, that's up 2 percent.  Sixty-three percent are 
against.  That is up 14 percent.   
 
20:40:54 
 
Seven percent are undecided, but this means the vote goes for the team arguing against 
the motion.  Our congratulations to them.
