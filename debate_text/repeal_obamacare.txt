John Donvan: 

And now to open what is our spring season of our fifth year of Intelligence Squared U.S. 

the chairman of the organization that makes it all possible, Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. 

 

Robert Rosenkranz: 

Well thank you all.  Thank you all for braving the weather to come and for joining us 

tonight.  You know I do have in addition to my role on Intelligence Squared a day job 

and it’s running an insurance company which gets around two percent of its premiums 
from medical insurance.  So this debate is not very material to our business but I thought 

I should share that fact with you in the interest of full disclosure.  You know, I also want 

to share some of my own insurance expertise as it relates to tonight’s motion.  What 
seems clear to me is that healthcare costs are out of control.   

 

18:51:22 

 

They amount to around 16 percent of the U.S. economy compared to nine percent in 

other rich countries.  Health costs have been a major drag on employment and growth and 

have jeopardized the financial position of the federal government, state governments and 

frankly we have no better health outcomes to show for these costs.  In considering the 

arguments of our panelists tonight, you might want to think about the effect of this bill on 

costs.  There is a credible argument that the bill makes a serious effort to address 

Medicare costs in particular. After all, some 30 percent of all healthcare costs in America 

are incurred in the last hundred and eighty days of life.  Some Republicans, by the way, 

have been quite disingenuous about this, raising the specter of “death panels” and World 
War II vets languishing without appropriate care.

18:52:22 

 

But another major driver of out-of-control costs are tort lawyers, medical malpractice 

insurance premiums and especially the defense of cover-you-rear medicine that they 

foster.  Democrats, traditional allies of the tort bar, have hardly been forthright about this 

aspect of the situation. Another factor is that consumers of health care generally have 

little incentive to control costs. Why should they economize if insurance companies are 

paying?  Most insurance covers things you can’t budget.  Car insurance doesn’t cover oil 
changes.  Home owners insurance doesn’t cover a soiled rug.  But when it comes to 
health insurance, we expect coverage of every conceivable medical benefit.  Most 

insurance policies are priced to reflect risk.  Teenagers pay more for auto insurance.  

Smokers pay more for life insurance and so forth.   

 

18:53:21 

 

But for health coverage, most states have mandated that everyone in the community pays 

the same.  What this means is that healthy young people pay excessive premiums they 

can’t well afford in order to subsidize their better-off but more illness prone elders.  They 
often quite rationally elect to not buy the over-priced coverage.  This bill would force 

them to do so.  But whether requiring someone to purchase something they don’t want is 
even constitutional will surely be touched on in tonight’s debate.  So in considering the 
arguments you’ll hear this evening, I encourage you to listen with the following kinds of 
questions in mind.  Does the bill address unproductive and undignified end-of-life care?  

Does it rein in tort lawyers to discourage defensive medicine?  Does it encourage us as 

consumers to care about what we spend?   

 

18:54:20 

 

Does it provide appropriate incentives for healthy life styles and preventive care?  These 

are not rhetorical questions.  But they’re very complex just like the bill we’re discussing.  
We have a stellar roster of panelists to help illuminate these issues and it’s now my 
pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, John Donvan.  Thank you 

very much. 

 

John Donvan: 

Thank you.

Thank you, Robert.  And I would just like another round of applause for Robert 

Rosenkranz.

Two words, “Repeal Obamacare,” that is our motion.  That is what we are here to debate.  
I’m John Donvan of ABC News at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New 
York University and on hundreds of NPR stations across the nation for another debate 

from Intelligence Squared U.S.  “Repeal Obamacare,” and to debate this motion we have 
a congressman, presidential advisers, and a man who has written more about the topic 

than anybody, I think we can say literally.   

 

18:55:25 

 

And in this debate, we want you to listen carefully because you are a live audience.  You 

act as our judges.  By the time this debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote 

two times, once before the debate and once again afterwards.  And the team that has been 

most persuasive, that has changed most of your minds will be declared our winner.  So 

let's go to our preliminary vote.  Go to those key pads at the right hand side of your seat.  

Our motion is "Repeal Obamacare."  And if you agree with this motion, push number 

one.  If you're for repeal, it's number one.  If you disagree, it you are against repeal, it's 

number two.  If you are undecided, it's number three.  And if you feel that you've made 

an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote.  And you can ignore the 

other keys.   

 

18:56:20 

 

All right.  We're locking out the system, and we will present the results of both votes at 

the end of the debate. 

 

So on to round one.  Our motion is it "Repeal Obamacare."  And first, to argue for this 

motion, for repeal, I'd like to introduce John Shadegg, a congressman from Arizona.  Let 

me say, former congressman.  After eight terms, John Shadegg decided to step away from 

the job which is not something that a lot of people in your position -- actually, he tried 

twice.  The first time -- the first time your fellow Republicans asked you not to leave. 

 

John Shadegg: 

That's true. 

 

John Donvan: 

Finally, you got away, John.  And they liked your rhetoric, which included on this topic a 

reference to the Obama reform program as Soviet style gulag healthcare.  I want to say, 

come now.  Hey.  Do you stand by that? 

 

John Shadegg: 

No.  I think that it is a -- it is a part of the dialogue that you try to get attention.  And that 

was an attempt to gather some attention. 

 

John Donvan: 

And it worked.  We'll see what else you have to say tonight.  Ladies and gentlemen, John 

Shadegg.

18:57:24 

 

John Shadegg: 

Thank you very much, John.  And thank you to the audience.  You play a key role here 

tonight.  I want to thank Intelligence Squared for sponsoring this debate.  And I want to 

recognize my opponents, one of whom has written more than anybody else in the world 

on this topic.  And most of all, I want to thank my debate partner, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, 

former CBO director and a senior policy advisor to Senator John McCain.  My partner, 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin is a numbers guy, and he will focus on the numbers.  And I believe 

he will be able to clearly show you that Obamacare both won't work and perhaps more 

importantly, will put a critical strain on our nation's fiscal stability.  Let me begin, 

however, by refuting two arguments.  First, supporters of Obamacare will say that 

Republicans simply don't believe in healthcare and indeed that they favor the status quo.  

That is simply wrong.  I believe in my tenure in Congress I had written more healthcare 

reform bills than any other member of Congress.  I wrote a number of patients rights bills 

in the early debate.   

 

18:58:20 

 

But I was also joined throughout this with the help of Paul Ryan and Tom Coburn and 

Jim DeMint and Richard Burr and Dr. Tom Price and Dr. Burgess and on and on.  And 

you would find countless proposals by Republicans to reform our nation's healthcare. 

 

Second, supporters of Obamacare will tell you that it will actually save the government 

money. And they will tell you that repealing it will cost the government money.  Now, 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin will demonstrate with the numbers that those claims are unfounded.  

But I urge you to begin by just looking at this question with common sense.  Obamacare 

insures roughly 32 million additional Americans, most through Medicaid.  That will 

increase costs.  It creates a massive new bureaucracy, some 150 plus agencies and 

bureaus.  That's got to increase costs. And it extends dramatic new mandates over health 

insurance in America.  And that will increase costs. 

 

Now, let me move on to one point that I think is very important to understand.   

 

18:59:22 

 

The current system is in fact broken.  As I said, I have written numerous bills to try to fix 

it.  Costs are way too high, and they're going up too quickly.  There are too many 

uninsured and too many Americans have pre-existing conditions and cannot get 

affordable coverage.  I have a pre-existing condition, and I have an older sister who has -- 

who is a breast cancer survivor, probably the worst kind of pre-existing condition. 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

One aspect of the current system is in fact indefensible.  It's the provision that says your 

employee-provided care is tax free.  It costs them no taxes and you no taxes.  But it 

punishes those without employee-provided care.  Indeed, it tells them, we want you to get 

insurance so much we're going to force you to pay for it with after-tax dollars, making it 

a third more expensive.  That is simply outrageous and indefensible.  And stunningly, 

Obamacare does not fix that problem. 

 

Obamacare is simply the wrong answer.  First, it addresses symptoms, namely the 

uninsured, which are too high.   

 

19:00:24 

 

But it does not address, I do not believe appropriately, certainly not with incentives, cost. 

 

Second, it will not only increase the cost to the government, but it will drive up your 

premiums. And the experts agree on that point.  It moves -- and perhaps this is most 

important--healthcare decision making away from employers and the insurance 

companies they hire, and they're making lousy decisions, and they shouldn't be deciding.  

But it doesn't give those decisions to you and me.  It gives them to the government. 

 

What we need to do is take decision making away from employers and insurance 

companies and give it to people.  Give it to patients, individuals and their families, and let 

them consult with their doctor and make those decisions.  Republican proposals in 

Congress do exactly that. Why?  Because if the health insurance is yours, not your 

employer's and not the government's, it's personal, and it belongs to you.  You can make 

the changes.   

 

19:01:23 

 

You aren't trapped in a plan your employer picked.  You can force the insurance 

companies to compete, which they don't do now.  You can hire the plan of your choice.  

And because it's yours, you can fire it, meaning you can hold it accountable to you. 

 

Briefly, let me touch on why Obamacare will drive costs up.  By its terms, Obamacare 

institutes lots of mandates.  One is guaranteed issue, meaning nobody can be turned 

down.  That will increase cost.  One is modified community rating.  That will increase 

costs.  And a third is an array of new benefit mandates.  All of those will increase costs.  

Indeed, in every state, with guaranteed issue and community rating, and in every state 

where they mandated more and more benefits, costs have gone up dramatically.  In 

Massachusetts, after adopting a plan very similar to Obamacare, costs have continued to 

go up at a rate faster than the national average. 

 

Let me touch on some of Obamacare's broken promises.   

 

19:02:23

The president told us over and over, and quite frankly, over again, that if you like your 

plan, you can keep it.  Not true.  He said if you like your doctor, you can keep it.  You 

can keep him or her. Not true.  And he said that Obamacare would send the cost curve 

down.  None of those promises, as we examine the plan, turn out to be true.  The 

Medicare actuary has already estimated that some 14 million people will lose their 

current coverage.  Leading experts say few plans will actually survive.  How could they 

survive?  They have to meet benefit mandates that haven't even yet been written. 

 

In fact, thousands of Americans will lose their employer-provided healthcare because 

their small employer or large employer cannot afford to continue to offer it.  They will 

lose their healthcare. AT&T, a study was done and provided to the commerce committee 

that showed AT&T will save $2 billion, $2 billion if they cancel their employees' care 

and pay the fine.   

 

19:03:30 

 

John Deere will lose $150 million a year.  Caterpillar, $100 million a year.  3M, $90 

million a year.  The numbers go on and on.  Those employers will have no choice to their 

stockholders but to drop that care.  They'll be forced.  And think about their workers.  

Their workers will lose their current plan, and they'll lose their doctor.  We simply have 

to do better than that. 

 

The new, indeed, one provision of the law is outrageously unfair, as unfair as the tax code 

is now.  It provides, in the new healthcare exchanges, that if you are uninsured, or if you 

buy in the individual market, you can enjoin the exchange.  And if you join the exchange, 

you can get a government subsidy.  But if you have employer-provided care, you cannot 

join the exchange. That simply isn't fair because it means the cost of your care is 

subsidized, some with the exact same income cannot get subsidized care. 

 

19:04:27 

 

John Donvan: 

John Shadegg, your time is up.  Thank you very much.

John Donvan: 

Thank you, John Shadegg.  We're debating a motion, "Repeal Obamacare" in this 

Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  And now to argue against the motion, Paul Starr, who 

is a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton.  He's a Pulitzer Prize winner 

for his book on healthcare called “The Social Transformation of American Medicine.”  
Paul, you also were an advisor to President Clinton the first time the Democrats tried to

pull off a major reform and failed.  What got right this time that you got wrong last time 

to at least get the act -- get the law passed? 

 

Paul Starr: 

Well, I think one of the big differences this time was more consensus.  Might seem 

strange in the light of what Congressman Shadegg has said, but more consensus among 

Democrats in Congress, consensus between the White House and Congress, more 

consensus also with the stakeholder groups in healthcare who realize that the current 

course is unsustainable, that we need to change and -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Well, let me let you get launched on your seven minutes. 

 

19:05:26 

 

Paul Starr: 

Okay, well, because -- 

 

John Donvan: 

I feel like I should deduct. 

 

Paul Starr: 

All right. 

 

[laughter] 

 

John Donvan: 

I'm joking.  Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Starr. 

 

Paul Starr: 

Thank you. 

 

[applause] 

 

We should uphold the Affordable Care Act because it is morally the right thing to do and 

it is in our common interest.  And when I first began work on the healthcare back in the 

1970s, the official number for the uninsured was 26 million, 12 percent of the population.  

By the early '90s, it was up to 37 million.  Now it's reached 50 million.  And if we were 

to do the kinds of things that the Congressman has advocated, the number will go higher.  

Fifty million, that's already a lot of people for whom illness is devastating, who may lose 

everything they have because of illness. For years surveys have shown that anxiety about 

not being able to pay for the healthcare you need ranks at the top of Americans' anxieties.   

 

19:06:28 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And Americans are more likely -- much more likely than people in the other rich 

democracies to put off getting medical care for fear of the cost.  Still, the majority of 

Americans, and I guess most of the people here tonight, do have insurance, and it's tricky 

to figure out how to help the millions who get a raw deal while protecting the interests of 

those who already have protection. The Affordable Care Act is an intelligently crafted 

effort to do that.  It extends coverage in two ways, by expanding Medicaid for poor 

people who've been cut out of that program, and by creating insurance exchanges where 

other people can easily and efficiently buy a private insurance plan under a new set of 

rules that, for example, prevent insurers from excluding preexisting conditions, and 

where subsidies are available to keep the premium for a medium leveled package at no 

more than eight percent of income.   

 

19:07:28 

 

Now, the insurance exchange is not just a hypothetical concept.  Massachusetts has a 

working exchange, The Health Connector, adopted as part of the reforms introduced by 

Governor Mitt Romney and passed overwhelmingly by both parties.  If you move to 

Massachusetts, you can use The Connector's website and, in half an hour, sign up for an 

insurance plan, no broker's fees, no hassle.  No wonder brokers don’t like the idea of the 
insurance exchange but we don’t kill off Expedia or Travelocity for the sake of the travel 
agents, do we?  And currently, if you buy coverage individually or through a small 

business, and if we all bought coverage individually the way the Congressman wants, 30 

cents or more out of every premium dollar gets sucked up in administrative and 

marketing costs.  The exchanges are just one way the reform squeezes out costs from the 

system.  In regard to coverage, the Affordable Care Act is modeled on the Massachusetts 

reforms.   

 

19:08:25 

 

It does a lot more on cost containment, and far from being a government takeover, the 

program aims to create a better functioning market for private insurance.  The origins of 

this idea go back to old Republicans -- Republican proposals, to a plan that Richard 

Nixon proposed in 1974, and to a bill introduced by Senator John Chafee, with 20 

Republican cosponsors, back in 1981 -- 1991, a bill by the way that had an individual 

mandate in it.  And substantively, the Affordable Care Act is bipartisan legislation.  We 

just don’t happen to live in a bipartisan political era.  Consider the law's moderate 
responsible approach to financing.  The basic idea is to find most of the money to expand 

coverage from within the healthcare system. We spend enough on healthcare, we just 

don’t allocate it well.   
 

19:09:22 

 

Healthcare providers and insurers will get more than 30 million new paying customers, 

and since the law's purpose is not to provide them with windfall profits, it claws back 

some of the revenue, for example, by reducing the future growth in Medicare payments, 

and by cutting excessive payments to private Medicare plans.  The law also imposes a tax 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

on high cost health plans that really should bring a smile to Douglas Holtz-Eakin because 

he defended a proposal that was functionally identical when he was John McCain’s 
Health Policy Advisor.  Our Republican friends will tell you that this legislation will 

explode the deficit, even though the CBO tells us it will reduce the deficit.  Now, Jon is 

my partner in this.  Jon Cohn is going to talk more about cost.  But while you're listening 

to the other side, please bear in mind that when Bill Clinton left office we were looking at 

a $3.1 trillion surplus back then. 

 

19:10:24 

 

And Bush came in, cut taxes, passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit with no 

financing, sent us to war in Iraq without taxes to pay for it and, of course, the deficit 

exploded.  It exploded on their watch leaving us in the end with a financial crisis and the 

great recession.  What happened to health care costs in that period, in the years between 

2001 and 2006 when Republicans had control of both the White House and Congress?  

What did they do about health care costs?  Here are the facts.  Family health insurance 

premiums went up 87 percent compared to 20 percent increase in general inflation and a 

decline of three percent in real median household income.  Faced with a potential death 

spiral in the individual and small group markets, many of the interest groups that opposed 

healthcare reform in the past, the American Medical Association, the hospitals, the for-

profit hospitals, too, even many of the insurers decided that the current situation had to be 

changed.   

 

19:11:29 

 

And that’s why we got legislation in 2010 and not just because of the Democrats but 
because so many in healthcare saw it was wrong and worked to make it -- to change it.  

Now just a word on Mr. Shadegg’s proposals.  We have low-regulation states, states that 
don’t regulate the insurance industry.  His own state of Arizona is one of those states and 
their costs are just as high as elsewhere.  Arizona has 20 percent uninsured.  The high 

deductible insurance policies combined with tax-advantage savings accounts that he and 

other Republicans favor and put into law haven’t shown any sign of reducing costs or 
extending coverage.  They are, however, a great tax shelter and in fact if you’re in a high 
tax bracket, it’s great to have a health savings account.   
 

19:12:26 

 

You can put money in the account, don’t even use it for healthcare and withdraw it after 
age 65 without penalty.  So those are proposals that are great for people who are healthy 

and well-off. They just don’t happen to do much for the low-income workers and the 
others who really face the difficulties in paying for healthcare. 

 

John Donvan: 

Sir, your time is up.  Thank you very much.

We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I’m 
John Donvan of ABC News.  We have four debaters, two teams of two, who are fighting 

it out over this motion, “Repeal Obamacare.”  You have heard from the first two debaters 
and now on to the third.  To argue for the motion, to argue for the repeal of Obamacare, 

I’d like to introduce Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who is president of the American Action 
Forum.  He was with the McCain campaign as an adviser and in his critiques of the 

Obama health plan, came up with the telling phrase, “fantasy in, fantasy out.”   
 

19:13:27 

 

I believe that’s yours.  You own that.  You also -- 
 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

Not very profitable but I own it. 

 

John Donvan: 

Yes.  I also learned through Google another delicious fact -- you were a good sport about 

it -- but after leaving the McCain campaign, you couldn’t get health insurance for some 
time. 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

Not exactly right but I have a pre-existing condition.  Actually, I have two kidneys on my 

left side from some extensive work before the 21st Century and I was left on COBRA 

coverage and the solution, of course, is to start your own employer so I started a think 

tank to get insurance. 

 

[laughter] 

 

John Donvan: 

So you’re covered. 
 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

I am covered. 

 

John Donvan: 

You took it the hard way. Ladies and gentlemen, Douglas Holtz-Eakin.  Thank you. 

 

[applause] 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

So thank you very much for the chance to be here tonight to our sponsors and to our 

opponents.  You know, I’m going to ask you to support the motion but in the end, you’ve 
all realized that what we’re debating tonight is about getting healthcare reform in the 
United States because there is no dispute about the need for healthcare reform.

19:14:26 

 

My own history, John’s history, probably the histories on the other side of the table of 
which I’m unaware are stark tribute to the need to do things better in the United States.  
Real healthcare reform has two pieces.  Number one, it extends healthcare coverage to 

Americans, gives them options for insurance and insurance is a product which shifts 

around the cost of your healthcare. In the end, an insurance system takes the nation’s 
health care bill and shifts around who picks up the ultimate cost, moving it from some 

people who are unable to shoulder the full burden of the cost of their care to some others 

who may be able to.  The second piece, the piece that drives everything, is the overall 

healthcare bill.  And the United States has a health care bill which is far too large and 

certainly far too large for what we get.  At one-sixth of our economy, it’s one of the most 
inefficient pieces of economics that one could imagine.  And the key fact to remember in 

thinking about this debate is that over the past four decades.  If you look at income per 

person in the United States and healthcare spending per person, the resources versus the 

costs, costs have been winning at two to two and a half percentage points every year for 

four decades.   

 

19:15:34 

 

Republicans, Democrats alike.  It is the costs and the spending on healthcare that 

ultimately has to be covered by insurance premiums.  And if you don't control costs, you 

cannot control insurance premiums, and you cannot deal with extending coverage to 

Americans, which is ultimately what real healthcare reform is about.  I favor repeal 

because this reform flunks the test of healthcare reform.  It does not deal with the cost 

problem. 

 

Now, I don't need to say so.  Many people, far more qualified than I, have said so.  The 

Congressional Budget Office, in the aftermath of passage of the Affordable Care Act, put 

out its new long-term care -- or its new long-term budget projections.  Did health 

spending in the federal budget grow more slowly as a result of this?  No, it does not.   

 

19:16:22 

 

You can look at the CMS actuary, the administration, the Obama administration's own 

chief actuary, Richard Foster, who estimates that the affordable care actually will raise 

national healthcare spending, not lower it, and will actually endanger the future of 

Medicare, not make it more solid. 

 

You can ask Jonathan Gruber.  Jonathan Gruber is one of the architects of Obamacare.  

He's one of the architects of the Massachusetts reform on which Obamacare was founded.  

And in his article in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, he says, “This isn't 
about cost reform.  This is health insurance reform.  There's nothing in it.  Much like 

Massachusetts, it's just about covering people.  It doesn't control costs.”

And you can look at the experience in Massachusetts where, prior to reform, 

Massachusetts had costs that were 25 percent higher than the national average.  And after 

reform, they were at 30 percent higher than the national average, no improvement in the 

fundamental requirement of healthcare reform. 

 

So we need to get the healthcare reform.  And without that, we will never control the 

budgetary costs that threaten our nation.   

 

19:17:22 

 

Now, I'm a former CBO director.  It is my obligation to stand up in public and say 

apocalyptic things about the budgetary future.  I'll spare you the numbers tonight because 

I like you more than my children.  But the bottom line is this nation, looking forward -- 

forget re-litigating the past. Mr. Starr is good at that.  But looking forward in the 

administration’s budget 10 years from now, after the financial crisis is in memory, after 
we’re soon to be out of Iraq, out of Iran, after the economy is [unintelligible] back at five 
percent unemployment, we are running a deficit of a trillion dollars.  Nine hundred billion 

of it's to pay interest on previous borrowing.  We are headed to that magical position 

where we're borrowing to pay previous borrowing and nothing else. Along the road, we 

will pass the criteria for downgrade as a sovereign nation.  We will no longer be a top-

rated borrower.   

 

This act makes that situation worse, not better.  It says that two new open-ended 

entitlement programs that will grow, according to CBO, at eight percent a year, as far as 

the eye can see, the economy is not going to grow at eight percent.  Revenue's not going 

to grow at eight percent.   

 

19:18:23 

 

The only way you could make that kind of a move add up budgetarily is smoke, mirrors 

and gimmicks.  And that's what the Affordable Care Act is riddled with, in which the 

CBO was forced to acknowledge in its score.  If you give them handcuffs, they'll come 

up with any answer that you might want. 

 

So we can't afford this as a nation.  It is dangerous because it doesn't control costs.  It's 

not really healthcare reform.  You need to vote for healthcare reform, not Obamacare. 

 

One sixth of our economy is underperforming.  If we care about economic performance, 

we should repeal Obamacare.  Forget the mandates, forget the taxes.  We had a system 

that was broken to begin with.  One-sixth of our economy is broken.  Why not fix it 

instead of writing checks and papering over it? 

 

But you hear some other arguments from the other side, the popular ones, now, the issues 

of fairness.  Let us stipulate this is one of the most unfair pieces of legislation ever 

passed.  There are the inequities between two people similarly situated, making $70,000.   

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016

19:19:21 

 

One's going to get $7,000 in federal subsidies, 10 percent of their income.  The other's 

going to get zip.  That is grotesquely unfair.  And if any future Congress acts 

[unintelligible] pass one, it'll get solved in a nanosecond.  They'll give everybody the 

money.  And my first problem will blow up even worse.  Terrible idea.  And for every 

young person in this audience, this is a disaster. Through the individual mandate you'll be 

obligated to be in the pool.  The purpose is to put you in there to pay the healthcare bills 

of people who are older and sicker than you.  And at the end of your life, you get to pick 

up the debt that's been incurred through Obamacare.  You'll get it at the front end.  You'll 

get it at the back end.  It is one of the most inter-generationally unfair things that has ever 

been scripted by the United States Congress.  Should be repealed on those grounds alone. 

 

There are other sort of detours along the way.  The insurance companies, that's where all 

the costs come from.  Oh, my God, there are administrative costs.  There are profits.  The 

top 10 insurance companies in 2009 made $260 billion.  That's a lot of money.  I'd like to 

have it.  The cost growth problem every year is $175 billion.  So go for it.   

 

19:20:25 

 

Nationalize the insurance companies, confiscate their profits.  You get about a year and a 

half's worth of relief, and we're right back where we were.  This isn't about insurance 

companies.  This is about fundamental changes to the delivery system so that we 

coordinate care so that we deliver high quality care at lower costs.  And the greatest 

missed opportunity here was the chance to fix Medicare, which is at the root of our 

problems.  Medicare pays doctors.  It pays hospitals.  It pays some insurance companies, 

and it pays drug companies.  And it has silos to pay them all.  And nowhere in there can 

you find a beneficiary.  Nowhere in there can you get coordination of care.  Nowhere in 

there is the kind of healthcare Americans deserve.  We should fix that first.  We should 

repeal this now.  Thank you.

John Donvan: 

Thank you, Douglas Holtz-Eakin.  Our motion, "Repeal Obamacare" and our final 

speaker in opening statements to speak against the motion, Jonathan Cohn who is a senior 

editor at the New Republic.    

 

19:21:21 

 

He wrote a book called “Sick:  The Untold Story of America's Healthcare Crisis,” which 
in some ways explains his evolution from pure journalist into advocate with these scores 

and scores of stories of people in dire straits that he reported and is very passionate about.  

You also had a blog throughout the debate called The Treatment.  And you signed off, 

after the legislation passed, saying, and I quote you, "The debate has ended."  So why are 

we here?

Jonathan Cohn: 

I like to think it's been a full employment act for people like me who write about 

healthcare. 

 

John Donvan: 

Ladies and gentlemen, Jonathan Cohn. 

 

[applause] 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Thank you.  I want to thank the audience.  I want to thank the foundation.  I want to thank 

my opponents.  I want to thank Doug Holtz-Eakin in particular for some of the comments 

he just made about the dire fiscal straits of the country, the importance of trying to get 

healthcare costs under control because if we don't get healthcare costs under control, 

we're not only going to bankrupt our government, we're going to bankrupt our entire 

society.  And you know, I agree with all of that.  I do. 

 

19:22:20 

 

Where we differ you may -- as you may imagine, is that I happen to think the Affordable 

Care Act, Obamacare, helps us in that regard.  Now, you listened to this team over here.  

You've listened to their argument.  And they painted a very dire picture of a program out 

of control that's going to cost more than anybody thinks.  It's going to leave us all paying 

tons in insurance premiums.  And you know, they have to paint an apocalyptic picture 

because I think the honest truth is most of us, when we hear that -- about the benefits of 

the plan, that we'll be able to guarantee coverage for people who have pre-existing 

conditions, the right to appeal treatments when their insurance company turns it down, 

subsidies for people who can't buy coverage now. People like that.  They think that is a 

good idea.  So they focus on this cost question.  And, you know, during the healthcare 

debate, we had all this scare talk about death panels and other things that just were simply 

not in the [unintelligible] -- with all due respect to my -- to our debating opponents here 

who I know have spent a lot of time talking about it, I think they're giving you, well, I 

don't want so say they're making things up out of whole costs [spelled phonetically], but I 

think they're giving you a slightly, let's say, one-sided picture of things. 

 

19:23:22 

 

So I did two things here.  First, I want to explain why I have faith that the Obama 

healthcare bill will in fact reduce costs.  And I want to specifically go through some of 

the arguments they have made and tell you why they are misleading. 

 

Now, why do I have faith that this healthcare bill will save money?  I mean isn't -- 

Congressman Shadegg said, isn't it common sense that it won't?  I don't think it's common 

sense.  I look around the world.  I look at countries like France and Germany and 

Switzerland and Japan, countries that get just as good healthcare as we do or better, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

people who have easier access to healthcare, and yet they spend less than we do.  Now, is 

there something about the United States that we're not capable?  We're not innovative 

enough?  We can't do that?  I don't think so.  Certainly it is possible, certainly, to get 

excellent healthcare, cover everybody and save money.  So the question is, will this bill 

do it?  And I believe it will. 

 

Let me take a second to explain how the bill is designed to do that.  It has three basic 

approaches.  One is to get the low-hanging fruit of healthcare, the waste.  A lot of it's 

corporate welfare.  Right now, for example, insurance companies that provide benefits 

through Medicare, study after study has shown that we pay them too much.   

 

19:24:24 

 

They're making too much in profits.  So we say we're going to take some of that back.  

We're going to take back that corporate welfare. 

 

Another source of offsetting revenue for the healthcare program is to go and ask people 

who have benefited the most from our economy, the people who are the very wealthiest 

in our society, to pay back a little more in taxes.  And we get money from there.  Now, I 

don't think either of those propositions are in dispute in terms of that those things will 

generate money to offset the costs of the healthcare plan.  Now, they may not like those 

ideas.  And that's fine.  And maybe in the question and answer period they can tell us 

why they think we need to keep giving insurance companies corporate welfare.  Why the 

richest people in this country, who are enjoying far lower tax rates than they had during 

the Clinton administration, can't afford to pay a little more. 

 

But it's the third part of healthcare reform, the third part of cost control that's the most 

important. And this is where we really look at the way the American medical care system 

works.  Everybody who is -- every expert left and right says we waste a ton of money in 

our medical care system.   

 

19:25:22 

 

Some of this is administrative waste because everyone's dealing with 10 different 

insurance companies.  Some of this is duplicative treatments because Dr. A doesn't know 

what Dr. B is doing to patient C.  Some of this is the fact that we pay tons of money for 

treatments that don't work.  The Obama healthcare bill, what it does is it tries to attack 

those, and it tries dozens of different approaches, and it's not a liberal takeover, it is not 

something crazy extremists cooked up on one side, it's actually the best ideas of the left 

and the right.  It's ideas like not paying hospitals if they run high rates of in-hospital 

infection.  It's things like developing electronic medical records so we can keep track of 

what patients are getting as they move through the medical system.  It's about giving 

financial incentives to doctors and hospitals that coordinate care and focus on prevention, 

and efforts like this that together, the smartest people have stated this, all believe will 

help control healthcare costs.  Now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin got up here and said these 

numbers are crazy, that of course this is going to explode the deficit, and again, common 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

sense, well, the most reliable authority we have on this is the Congressional Budget 

Office.   

 

19:26:31 

 

Congressional Budget Office is the gold standard of accounting.  The CBO -- my reading 

of the CBO report is that they looked at the healthcare bill and they said, "You know 

what? This bill will reduce the deficit.  It will reduce the deficit in the first 10 years, it 

will reduce it by a lot more afterwards."  And by the way, the rate of growth in healthcare 

spending is going to start to slow down.  Now, it is true that the CBO, you can say, 

"Well, the CBO ought to use these rules," or whatever.  Well, what the CBO rules mean 

is that we are assuming that the laws that we have passed are going to be implemented, 

and that is the way -- and that is the way the government accounting system works.  

Douglas Holtz-Eakin says, "Well, that never works because we've never seen it happen."  

Well, you know what?  It's happened before.  During the late 1990s we tried to control 

costs in Medicare and we did for a while.  We passed very large cuts to Medicare during 

the Balanced Budget Act.   

 

19:27:22 

 

It was the late 1990s, and you know what?  Those cuts stuck, and we were able to reduce 

the growth of Medicare from where it would’ve been otherwise.  It’s entirely possible to 
do this.  Now, in order to do this you have to actually stick with a program.  As my 

colleague mentioned, during the Bush administration they passed a different -- they tried 

to approach healthcare in a different way.  They said, “All right, let’s try a different 
approach, and let’s have a healthcare bill, let's not pay the cost for it.”  Well, that did 
increase the deficit, and that is the sort of choice we’re talking about facing here.  Now, 
my colleague -- my opponent, Mr. Holtz-Eakin, cited a number of authorities he believed, 

and he said, “Well, John Gruber of MIT says this is not good,” or he said, “The CMS 
actuary said this."  Well, in fact, if you look at the written record, the people -- the list of 

experts who have endorsed this, it’s not just the Congressional Budget Office, it’s people 
like David Cutler, a professor at Harvard University, who won the John Base Clark 

Medal for the most accomplished economist under 40.   

 

19:28:26 

 

It's people like Jonathan Gruber from MIT -- I know he quoted Jonathan Gruber -- 

Jonathan Gruber has said many times he endorses this bill.  He thinks it's our best shot 

right now to get healthcare costs under control.  It's people like Mark McClellan, who 

hasn said that he believes the Affordable Care Act will start to reduce healthcare 

spending, and why do we care about Mark McClellan?  Because Mark McClellan ran 

Medicare in the Bush administration, and it’s people like the Simpson-Bowles 
Commission, the bipartisan fiscal commission said, "The cost control in the Affordable 

Care Act will be affected, and we need if anything to double down on it."  This is not my 

opinion, it’s not some crazy opinion, it is in fact the opinion of the best experts of left and 
right.

Jonathan Cohn, your time is up. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Thank you. 

 

John Donvan: 

Thank you very much.  

 

[applause]   

 

And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where the motion 

being argued is "Repeal Obamacare."  Now, keep in mind how you voted at the top of the 

evening, because you’re going to be asked to vote again at the conclusion, and I want to 
remind you that the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner.   

 

19:29:26 

 

So, now, on to round two where the debaters can address one another directly, and also 

take questions from me and you in the audience.  I’m John Donvan of "ABC News."  We 
are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.  We have two 

teams of debaters, two against two, who are arguing over this motion, "Repeal 

Obamacare."  On one side, a former Congressman and former aide to John McCain are 

arguing that the plan passed by the Obama administration is going to blow up financially 

and will hurt America and is headed for the dust bin.  Arguing against them, a former 

advisor to the Clinton administration and a journalist who has written extensively about 

healthcare, arguing that this act -- that this law should be preserved, and not only 

preserved, but built upon.  I want to ask a question about philosophy. Both sides agree 

that the system we’ve lived with for the last 30 years, particularly in its last 15 or 20 
years, is broken.  You agree that something needs to be done.  You're arguing over the 

solutions. 

 

19:30:24 

 

Your opposition on one side to the president’s program and you’re supporting the other 
side says what fundamentally about what you think we are as a nation, as Americans.  I 

want to put that question first to you, John Shadegg, former congressman. 

 

John Shadegg: 

I’m thrilled to have that question because I think it’s vitally important.  I think we’re 
already -- we’re a nation that does support taking care of those who can’t care for 
themselves.  We’re a nation -- and my legislation covers every single American -- we’re a 
nation that thinks it’s outrageous that anybody would lose coverage because there are 
pre-existing condition like my heart condition or my sister’s breast cancer.  But we’re 
also a nation that honors limited government and honors individual choice.  I think on the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

one hand what you hear from the other side is that the government can manage this issue 

better.  And what I would suggest to you is we are in this problem because the 

government made changes that took you and I out of the equation.  The government said 

health insurance is available only if your employer buys it and you get a tax deduction.   

 

19:31:24 

 

But if you go out and buy it, it’s one-third more expensive.  If you can’t hire and fire 
somebody’s who delivering a service to you, you can’t hold it accountable including its 
costs. 

 

John Donvan: 

John, you’re saying there’s an issue of individual freedom here [unintelligible] 
 

John Shadegg: 

Absolutely.  The individual freedom is tied back to the cost of the service and because we 

can’t control it, you are controlling its cost. 
 

John Donvan: 

Let me take your response to the other side, Paul Starr who worked for the Clinton 

administration. 

 

Paul Starr: 

I do think this is a question of our public philosophy and the obligations that we owe to 

one another.  And it is, I think, a sad commentary on us that we remain the only advanced 

country that doesn’t provide protection to all of our citizens.  Now the reason that we 
have -- let’s go back to why we have this employer-based system.  If you don’t have 
government share, spread the costs of healthcare, there needs to be some organization 

that serves as the pool for risk.  

 

19:32:30 

 

And the employer is the most convenient way to do it.  That’s actually why this first 
developed in the 1930s and ‘40s before we had the tax advantages.  It’s simply going to 
default from the government to employers.  It’s not as though the government took this 
away from individuals. That individual market that the Congressman loves is 

phenomenally inefficient. 

 

John Donvan: 

But Paul, what about your opponents point that as a nation, philosophically as a nation, 

we’re defined by a commitment to limited government and that this program actually 
assaults that notion? 

 

Paul Starr: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

But it is a program, as I said before, that is trying to create a functioning market, a better 

functioning market than the one that currently exists.  Those exchanges will give people 

choices that they don’t now have.   
 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Shadegg: 

All the Republicans are arguing is that you ought to give that choice to people.   

 

19:33:27 

 

I do not favor individual purchase.  That was the attack made against Senator McCain 

throughout the campaign and it was absolutely unfair.  I favor a plan which says I as an 

individual can buy an individual plan, I can take my employer’s plan or I can buy from a 
whole group of expanded choices.  We could have my social club.  The Kiwanis Club can 

offer a plan. My university alumni can offer a plan.  Give me that choice, force those 

insurance companies to compete.  They don’t compete right now.  They don’t care what 
you and I pay for health insurance and they don’t, quite frankly, care whether it treats us 
well.  They only care that our employer bought the plan. 

 

John Donvan: 

Jonathan Cohn. 

 

[applause] 

 

Jonathan Cohn, arguing against repeal. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Well, I would say I think all of us favor choice.  Choice is a wonderful thing.  We want to 

give choice.  People who buy, I mean, we need to realize that the employer -- people who 

are getting private insurance are now divided into two groups.  There are people who get 

it from their employers and there are people who buy it on their own.  Neither of them 

has choices right now.  You’re buying insurance on your own?  Good luck buying a 
coverage policy.   

 

19:34:24 

 

You’re going to have trouble finding one, particularly if you have pre-existing conditions. 
 

John Shadegg: 

You’ve got to shop across state lines. 
 

Jonathan Cohn: 

We’ll talk about that in a second.  This Affordable Care Plan, what it does is it says, all 
right, let’s create a market, a real market, a place -- kind of like Expedia, like they have in 
Massachusetts now where everybody who’s buying one actually gets a choice of 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

insurance programs, a set of plans that they know they can afford that will be made 

available to them regardless if they’re a cancer survivor and let all of those people shop.  
Meanwhile, employers who have insurance for their employees will continue to provide 

that.  Look, at some point it is very easy to say we want to open up exchanges for 

everybody and let everybody shop.  You can build on this system to do that.  You can do 

that.  But you’re never going to get to that system you’re talking about.  You will never 
get to a system where people have choice and a choice of actual plans that are available 

to everybody, that cover what they need, until you build these exchanges that are in the 

affordable care act. 

 

John Donvan: 

Douglas Holtz-Eaken.  You’re against the plan.   
 

19:35:23 

 

I want to ask you, what -- what do you think the public actually wants? 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

I have no idea.  Let me just -- I would never speak for 300 million Americans.  And that's 

one of the beautiful things about this country.  And I think the -- you know, I agree, 

obviously, with a lot of what Jon has said.  Go back to the beginning of the evening when 

we were asked to think about end of life care.  Now, do you really think that Americans 

want an insurance company making decisions about the end of life care?  No.  They've 

already seen that model and rejected it -- 

 

John Donvan: 

So you are telling us what Americans want, or not. 

 

[laughter] 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

That you can't do that.  They told us, I’ll read that evidence.  I don't think they want the 
government making those decisions.  I think we know who makes those decisions.  It's 

the family.  It's -- those are the only people who are ethically well situated to make those 

tough calls.  And so we must, in the end, invest in families, the authority to make 

decisions, invest in them, their insurance.  

 

19:36:22 

 

Invest in them the information and the ability to make those decisions and center this 

system around families and Americans, not around these large government entities. 

 

What does that mean in practice?  I'm an economist.  I mean, economists are practical 

people. You follow your nose and incentives.  If I have an insurance policy when I'm 21, 

and then I develop an odd thing where I have to have my kidneys transplanted, I'm still 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

on that insurance policy.  Any insurance company now has to recognize they've got me 

for life.  It's not a one-year sign-up proposition where they can minimize on preventive 

care or they can try to cut off covering some things.  They have to deal with the right 

lifetime incentives.  Pay for the cheap prevention up front.  A lot of them eventually want 

to do that.  And align the insurance and the medical incentives to transform the way we 

deliver medicine in America.  That's what we need.  And in the process, guess what?  My 

insurance goes with me from job to job, job to home when I stayed home with my kids.  

You don't have to spend the whole time fighting over who works full time to get the 

insurance.  It's madness.  Americans are rearranging their lives for the insurance. 

 

19:37:25 

 

Let's rearrange the insurance so it fits American lives.  That's what this system will be. 

 

[applause] 

 

 

John Donvan: 

Jonathan Cohn, you said in your opening remarks -- Jonathan Cohn, you have said that 

the Obama plan took the best from both left and right.  Give me one idea from the right 

that your opponents will recognize as an idea that is from their side, that they just love. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Sure, absolutely.  Well, first of all, to start, there's a pilot program funding for 

malpractice reform. You know, believe it or not, people who wrote the Affordable Care 

Act, and I would include myself among this, actually believe that there is some money to 

be saved by reforming the malpractice system.  So there's money out there for -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Let me just take that to this side.  Do you recognize that as one of your ideas? 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

Can I just say the big problem -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin. 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

I will stipulate late one thing I want to get very clear on the table.  I support exchanges.  I 

support -- I always support good competitive markets.  And you can build exchanges that 

enhance competition left to do that.  There is a lot in the bill that is bipartisan.  It's in the 

delivery system reforms, not in the coverage expansions which are madness.  But they're 

all tiny. 

 

19:38:24  

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

They're pilots.  Pilots have a terrible track record of actually turning into real policy.  In 

fact the road to healthcare hell is paved with pilots and demonstrations.  And that's a pilot 

and a demonstration for a known problem.  If you've got a problem, fix it.  The problem 

with this bill, it doesn't fix what we know is the issue, healthcare costs.  Instead, it's got a 

bunch of pilots that Congress will never actually implement.  And it doesn't fix the 

biggest source of our problem, which is the Medicare system which pays for 

fragmentation, pays for overuse.  It's a fee for service system.  We have more problems 

created by those programs than this could ever solve. 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Donvan: 

So what's the point of the program. 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Paul Starr: 

I have to respond to this because really, you know, that's amazing for you to say about the 

Medicare program.  We had legislation under the Republicans to reform Medicare, to 

introduce private insurance plans into Medicare.  And what is the result?   

 

19:39:20

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

-- 30 seconds of getting facts straight.  The problem is the healthcare bill.  Medicare 

Advantage is one way to shift it from one person to another.  Tax policy, which he said 

would save us money, doesn't.  It just shifts the bill around from one person to another.  

The problem is the bill. This law does not change our healthcare bill.  That's its issue.

repealing Obamacare.

[applause] 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Why do you want to go back and start from scratch? 

 

John Donvan: 

John Shadegg. 

 

John Shadegg: 

I have to raise an issue which your side has raised, and that is you say it gives people 

choices. It takes a lot of gall to say that it gives people choices.  For example, in 

Medicare Advantage, it repeals Medicare Advantage for millions of Americans and takes 

them off. 

 

Paul Starr: 

It reduces subsidies that are [unintelligible]. 

 

John Shadegg: 

No, no.  It takes -- it will drive people off of Medicare Advantage.  Every expert agrees 

on that. 

 

19:41:22 

 

Two, you say that people will have choice of plans.  There is one plan prescribed by the 

government, actually has three different components, but that's it.  Three.  Secretary 

Sebelius can grant exemptions.  She already has too many companies.  She has the ability 

to impose new benefit mandates.  She has ability to say what premium increase is 

effective or not effective.  The notion that this bill gives the average American more 

choice is ridiculous.  It's going to take away the choices Americans have now, and it's 

going to force them into essentially a one-size-fits-all plan.  When you say, for example, 

to employers, that your costs are going to up, such as AT&T, to the tune where you could 

pay the fine for not insuring every one of your employees and still save $2 billion, they're 

going to have no choice but to drop their coverage and put people into the government-

run plan. 

 

Paul Starr: 

Can I just respond to this because this is the second time that you've mentioned this. 

 

John Shadegg:

If AT&T or any of these other companies wanted to drop coverage now -- 

 

19:42:26 

 

John Donvan: 

Hold on just one minute.  And you get 15 more seconds to finish your point.  Sit this 

thing down. 

 

John Shadegg: 

No, he can go.  That's fine. 

 

John Donvan: 

Oh, I give you 15 seconds, and you throw it away. 

 

John Shadegg: 

I mean -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay.  Paul. 

 

[laughter] 

 

Paul Starr: 

Under current law, if any of those companies wanted to drop coverage, they could do it 

legally. This law introduces a penalty for dropping coverage.  So how can you say that 

the law encourages them to -- 

 

John Shadegg: 

Precisely because right now they choose to provide that coverage for their employees 

because that competitive market requires them to do that.  People want good coverage.  If 

they drop that coverage, there's no place for those employees to go.  Under this bill, they 

will all get government subsidies.  And oh, by the way, AT&T can take that $2 billion 

savings and add it to people's salaries.  So the notion that this is going to give you more 

choice, when, for example, we don't allow interstate competition in health insurance now.  

Your employer makes the choice of your plan.

John Shadegg: 

Actually, number one, in Massachusetts, we're down to, I think, to only four carriers.  

Several of them are in dire straits.  Many of them have demanded from the governor that 

he allow them to raise rates.  The governor has said no.  And some of them -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Shadegg: 

-- are on the verge of folding.  Now, let me ask you something.  The plan, under 

Obamacare, says that if you're in an exchange, a government-run exchange, and you only 

offer the policy that the government exchange allows, then you can get a subsidy.  Every 

Republican plan says let's give every single American a tax refund, a tax credit to go buy 

the plan of their choice. Now, I guarantee you, if we do that, so we say to every 

American, you get a refundable tax credit, a refund, and for the poor, it's cash, to go buy 

the plan of your choice.  And you can buy your employer's plan.  You can buy in the 

individual market.  You can join a new group sponsored by the Kiwanis club.  You can 

join a new group sponsored by --

think if we offer great -- 

 

[talking simultaneously]  

 

John Donvan: 

So maybe a lot of that money would end up at the amusement park or the race track? 

 

John Shadegg: 

Well, let me tell you how my plan works.   

 

19:45:28 

 

It offers every single American, every single American that refundable tax credit if they 

don't make enough money if they do not enroll because they are homeless and don't get 

the notice we automatically enroll them because we know their Social Security number 

and we knew it as one point, they show up for care somewhere, and they say, "What plan 

did you enroll in?"  And the individual says -- she's a mother of three that was moving 

from Idaho to Arizona on the day that the notice came to her, she says, "I didn't enroll."  



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016

They look her up on a Social Security number and they say, "Oh, yeah, you're in the 

pool." 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay. 

 

John Shadegg: 

"And you're covered."  That's the way Paul Ryan's bill works, that's the way Tom 

Coburn's -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay, John, you've made that point.  I want to stay on the merits of the Obama plan.  Do 

you want to respond to that, either of you, gentlemen? 

 

Paul Starr: 

I want to respond to this whole notion that it's a complete individual free market here, to 

talk a little bit about the way insurance works.  Healthcare is very different from other 

kinds of services and commodities.   

 

19:46:23 

 

Seventy percent of the healthcare costs in any year are concentrated in 10 percent of the 

people.  So insurance companies have a very strong incentive to cherry pick, to go out 

and to look for the 50 percent of people who actually account for only three percent of 

the costs.  And when you have this market where supposedly everybody has individual 

choices, you also have a market where the insurance companies are going to cherry pick 

and avoid the sick people. They will do everything in their -- it is the best business model 

for them.  Rather than try to control healthcare costs, it's just to avoid sick people.  The 

way the exchanges work is that if you want to sell insurance in the exchange, you have to 

agree to take anybody.  That’s the bargain.  And what the exchange does, so the people 
pay in on a community rated basis, but the insurance companies get paid according to the 

risk of the population they enroll.  So if they enroll an older population, if they enroll a 

sicker population, they get paid more. 

 

19:47:24 

 

That’s what goes on through the exchange that won’t go on through this market.  I realize 
this is complicated.  Insurance is a complicated business, and this law is trying to take 

account of the way this business characteristically malfunctions.  That’s why we end up 
with millions of people uninsured. 

 

John Donvan:  

Okay, I’m going to come to questions and --

I’m going to come to questions from you in just a minute.  I want to give this side one 35-
second shot at [unintelligible] -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Donvan: 

So John Shadegg is taking [unintelligible]. 

 

John Shadegg: 

This criticism is often made, and the Democrat answer, the Obamacare answer is to say, 

“Okay, we’re going to do guaranteed issue, everybody gets insurance even if you're 
already sick."  The incentive of that is not to buy insurance until it’s too late or until the 
costs have gone up.  I’d like to ask Paul, “How is it the insurance companies know who’s 
going to get sick before the people know, and how is it that they can cherry pick the 

healthy?”  But let me tell you how Republicans solve this problem. 
 

19:48:21 

 

Male Speaker: 

[unintelligible] 

 

John Shadegg:  

Let me tell you how Republicans would solve this problem, I know because I happen to 

have written it, what you do is you say to everyone that has a preexisting condition or has 

a chronic illness, "You have the right, the absolute right to join what’s called a high risk 
pool.  You may enroll in that plan if you are either denied coverage altogether or if your 

coverage is priced at, we’ll say, 20 percent, or 30 percent, or more above the average 
cost, because you have a preexisting condition.  Once you enroll in the high risk pool, 

your health is covered comprehensively including my sister's breast cancer or my heart 

condition, and the -- so that means that the cost of insuring that pool is higher than the 

cost of insuring any other pool. That’s a high risk pool.  The costs of insuring that group 
are then subsidized either by dividing it equally, the extra costs amongst every insurance 

company in the jurisdiction, it could be the state or it could be federal, or by general 

revenues from the state, often done by sin taxes.   

 

19:49:22 

 

I happen to know that because it’s already the law in 22 different states. 
 

John Donvan: 

All right. 

 

John Shadegg: 

I happen to know it because I wrote the last federal law that allows it.

John Donvan: 

John, John, let me move on to some questions from the audience.  And if you -- what I’d 
like to ask you to do, I’ll call on you, wait till a microphone reaches you, and then hold 
the microphone about one fist's distance from your mouth so that the television and radio 

can hear you very clearly.  And there’s a gentleman in a black sweater.  Hey, sir, before 
you begin, I just want to ask you something, what have you heard so far that you thought, 

"Well, I hadn’t thought of that before"? 
 

Male Speaker: 

Hmm. 

 

[laughter] 

 

That's a tough question.  I thought I was asking the question.  

 

John Donvan: 

Guess we haven't -- 

 

[laughter] 

 

Your turn will come.  And I’ll give you a pass if you don’t have a ready answer to that.  
And I'm not meaning to put you on the spot, I’m actually quite curious to know how it’s 
being received out there.  So if you have no thoughts on that, we will pretend that 

question didn’t come up. 
 

Male Speaker: 

My only thought is, next time I will not be the first questioner. 

 

19:50:21 

 

[laughter] 

 

John Donvan: 

Go ahead. 

 

Male Speaker: 

My question is for the gentleman on this side.  Recently my house burned down and I 

tried to buy fire insurance after the fact and the insurance company said it was a pre-

existing fire. 

 

[laughter] 

 

Now, that doesn’t sound fair to me.  Does it sound fair to you? 
 

Paul Starr: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

No, no it’s not. That is why -- 
 

Male Speaker: 

So I should be able to buy fire insurance after my house burns down. 

 

Paul Starr: 

No, no absolutely not.  Look, one of the reasons that there is a mandate in this law is 

precisely to avoid the possibility that people will refuse to buy insurance until they get 

sick.  That’s the whole rationale for the mandate.  Now I’ve actually proposed another 
way to accomplish the same purpose because the mandate is the single most unpopular 

part of the bill.  People don’t understand that the mandate is directly related to the 
elimination of pre-existing condition exclusion.  You can’t eliminate those exclusions just 
for the reasons you said unless you have some way to get the people into the pool.   

 

19:51:26 

 

My alternative is the following.  If you want to opt out, if you don’t want to be part of the 
system, okay, you can do that without penalty.  But you have to sign a form saying “I 
won’t come back and I cannot come back in.  For five years, I can’t use the exchanges, I 
can’t get the subsidies, I can’t get a policy without the pre-existing conditions.”  So I 
understand your position completely. We need to be able to avoid the possibility that 

people will behave opportunistically. 

 

John Donvan: 

So Paul, you don’t want to repeal but you do want to tinker. 
 

Paul Starr: 

Oh, I am willing to make changes. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Tinkering’s fine.  We’re not against it.  Everybody who understands this plan thinks it’s 
not a perfect bill.  No bill is perfect.  The question is is it a good foundation. 

 

John Donvan: 

Let me do a very quick thing for radio.  This is a U.S. debate --

The -- I believe it was in the cost bills back in the ‘90s to try to reform Medicare, they 
had a formula to try to pay doctors at some rate pegged to inflation and it doesn’t work.  
I’m not an expert on it myself.  But I know it comes up in Congress quite frequently.  It 
causes a stir.  I think it somehow drives pay outs to doctors who see Medicare patients.  

Down 40 or 50 percent every six months.  I know it comes up in Congress pretty 

frequently.  I --

Okay.  If you don’t mind, I’m going to pass on the question unless it’s quite relevant.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

-- on this broken formula that reimburses doctors under Medicare, part of the BBA that 

Jonathan lauded which in the end failed miserably.  The bottom line is it’s not part of the 
bill because they left it out.  It’s part of the cost they don’t want to acknowledge.  If you 
want to know why this doesn’t reduce the deficit, they left out $300 billion worth of 
costs. And the CBO doesn’t have the option of saying hey, you left that out.  They have 
the obligation to price only what is in there. 

 

John Donvan: 

Jonathan Cohn. 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

And they are precluded by law from raising their hand and saying but you left out the 

doctors. 

 

John Donvan: 

Jonathan Cohn. 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

I ran the CBO. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Here’s something else.  You look at the CBO report on the Affordable Care Act and 
you’ll discover something shocking.  It doesn’t account for the cost of the war in 
Afghanistan. 

 

[laughter] 

 

Now that’s because the war in Afghanistan is a separate piece of legislation.  During the 
late 1990’s, as part of a much larger balanced budget bill that I recall quite correctly 
working and getting us balanced budgets for a while --

Jonathan Cohn:

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

This is a debate about healthcare.  And the fact of the matter is the balanced budget 

agreement healthcare provisions passed in the late '90s failed.  They did not control costs.

And in the end, the Congress had to give the money back, as they will have to give it to 

the physicians under Medicare.  That -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Jonathan, 20 seconds. 

 

Male Speaker: 

-- [unintelligible] did not work. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Okay.  You're hearing a very interesting version of the history of the '90s and healthcare.  

The doctor fix was built into our budgets for the government long before healthcare 

reform came on the scene.  It is something that needs to be fixed separately.  It would 

have to be fixed separately if we never had Obamacare.  It is a separate cost. 

 

John Donvan: 

Who can tell me in 15 seconds what it is, because I don't know.  

 

[laughter] 

 

Male Speaker: 

It is literally this.  It was a formula for reimbursements for doctors.  Doctors are very 

expensive. 

 

19:56:23 

 

And so they keep pretending they're not going to fulfill the formula.  And then doctors 

face a big pay cut.  And then Congress says, “Well, I guess we do have to pay doctors.  
Doctors are part of healthcare.” 
 

Jonathan Cohn: 

They are part of healthcare. 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

Part of healthcare reform. 

 

John Donvan: 

So your dad is afraid he's going to be paid less, but he isn't -- 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

Twenty five percent less next year unless they, once again, put the money back in. 

 

John Donvan: 

Another question, please.  From the far side with the gray hair. 

 

Male Speaker: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

I found it interesting that the panel is assuming that healthcare runs on a perfect market 

economy, which is fundamentally flawed.  I wanted to know about, you keep addressing 

costs. And I think that this debate is mostly about access to care and not really about 

costs.  Do either of you have an answer to utilization and patient and physician-induced 

demand, which is really the cost -- 

 

John Donvan: 

So is the bill designed to get people insured, or is it designed to keep the costs down 

primarily? Paul Starr. 

 

19:57:23 

 

Male Speaker: 

But nobody's addressed cost, which is utilization. 

 

Paul Starr: 

Well, it's both of those things.  But the questioner used a phrase which probably went by 

a lot of people.  He talked about physician-induced demand or provider-induced demand.  

So this is another aspect of how healthcare is different.  Normally, when you are the 

customer, you make decisions about what to buy.  But when you're a patient, particularly 

when you're very sick, you're in the hospital, other people are making decisions.  They're 

prescribing drugs, procedures and so forth.  And if you're really sick, and most of the big 

costs are generated for people who are very ill, it's not -- the demand isn't coming from 

you.  It's coming from the supplier.  This is a very bizarre system. 

 

John Donvan: 

[unintelligible] a very interesting point.  I want to hear -- and that's one of Paul Starr's 

basic arguments for why this is not like other things that you pay money for.  Can you 

respond to that, John -- Douglas Holtz-Eakin. 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

Couple responses.  Number one, there are no perfect markets.   

 

19:58:23 

 

And to somehow compare health markets against perfection misses the point.  All 

markets are, at some level, imperfect and have anomalies of the same type.  The solution 

to this is to better inform -- hang on.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  The important thing 

here is to have reforms which Republicans include as well as the -- your arguments, to 

better inform patients so they can distinguish between valuable and invaluable treatments.  

And we have a system riddled with low-value care.  And all of the reforms Republicans 

propose address that issue.  An important thing to recognize, the reason I'm deeply 

opposed to this bill is, it is fundamentally -- there are pages attached to all the issues.  But 

it is fundamentally a coverage bill.  And if you look at half the expansions, they are in 

Medicaid.  Sixteen million Americans we've put into Medicaid.  Medicaid's a terrible

system. Fifty percent of providers will not see Medicaid patients. Medicaid patients are 

twice as likely to show up at the ER for regular medical care than are the uninsured.   

 

19:59:27 

 

And it is a great joke to give someone an insurance policy called Medicaid and not let 

them actually see a physician. 

 

John Donvan: 

John Shadegg, you want to add to that briefly? 

 

John Shadegg: 

I do. 

 

John Donvan: 

To what your partner said. 

 

John Shadegg: 

In a New Republic article that came out some time ago, I'm sorry, the New York Times -- 

New York -- 

 

John Donvan: 

One of those. 

 

John Shadegg: 

-- article. 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Shadegg: 

New Yorker magazine was the article.  It documented -- 

 

John Donvan: 

John, start that again for the editing later on. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

You're taking out our -- 

 

John Donvan: 

For radio. 

 

John Shadegg: 

In a recent authoritative article which appeared in the New Yorker, they studied where 

healthcare costs are the highest.  And interestingly, they found that the highest place for 

healthcare costs in America is a little town called McAllen, Texas.  And they went to 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

McAllen, Texas, and tried to find out why are costs so high.  And what they found was a 

couple of different factors.   

 

20:00:22 

 

Number one, they found that doctors in fact do prescribe lots of procedures that are 

unnecessary.  And they do so in McAllen, Texas.  They noted that, for example, great 

healthcare centers do not prescribe that many procedures.  And so they figured out there 

needed to be a way.  They actually began interviewing doctors.  And they said, you know 

what?  In the current system, we are not incentivized to control costs.  Why are they not 

incentivized to control costs?  Because nobody's watching the store.  The reality is -- 

 

John Donvan: 

But you’re agreeing with that sort of monitoring. 
 

John Shadegg: 

As Paul said, if the consumer isn't paying the bill, then nobody's watching. 

 

Paul Starr: 

Yeah, yeah. 

 

John Shadegg: 

And in this circumstance, yeah, if you're sick, you're not making the decision.  But right 

now, your family could be making that decision.  But right now under the current system 

and under Obamacare, you will not be making that cost decision because you're cut out of 

the process. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

So I'm having this very disoriented feeling listening to a lot of this because you're stealing 

some of my talking points here.  Maybe -- 

 

John Shadegg: 

I love to do that. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

But, no, I agree.  That article was very influential.  Actually President Obama was known 

to have read it. 

 

John Shadegg: 

He did. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

He handed it around to his staff.   

 

20:01:27 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And I think most people who study the healthcare system agree that, you know, one of 

the weird things about our healthcare system is you have these bizarre regional variations.  

So you go to some parts of the country, and they're doing all kinds of extra procedures, 

and other parts of the country, they're not.  And why is that?  Well, the people who wrote 

this bill, they all read that article.  They all know this.  And the article actually built on 

years and years of studies showing that and it’s very specifically designed to help address 
that problem.  And there're all kinds of ways it does.  I mean, it would be -- I would love 

to be able to sit here and say, here is the silver bullet that will change it.  Because that's 

what he thinks.  “Oh, you know, if we just give everyone choice, you know, if we give 
everyone the consumer power it will somehow sort this all out.”  Well, good luck with 
that.  I mean, I don't know about you.  But the last time my kid was sick, it took me three 

hours on WebMD to figure out even what the symptoms were. 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Donvan: 

Did you -- do you just not like what you're hearing, or did you have a question to follow? 

 

Male Speaker: 

[unintelligible] 40 percent of all healthcare costs, so -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay.  I'm going to pass on to another question.  This gentleman right in the center.  

You've been very patient.  Here. 

 

20:02:22 

 

Male Speaker: 

I'd sort of like to get to the heart of the cost things because I think there's a little bit of 

denial going on.  An early mentor said to me if the financial analysis defies common 

sense, go with common sense.  So now we get 35 million new people coming into 

Medicaid.  We've got baby boomers retiring in droves going into the Medicare program.  

And we've got all that intercepting with all advancements in care and treatments, 

procedures and drugs which extend life and make life more livable.  And a big 

underpinning, a big way that the Obama bill is going to get this under control is by 

slowing the cost of Medicare and Medicaid.  I believe the number is about -- 

 

John Donvan: 

So can you focus to a question. 

 

Male Speaker: 

Pardon me? 

 

John Donvan: 

Can you focus to a question, having studied your premise.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Male Speaker: 

Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's what I think is going to happen.  I want you to tell me it's 

not. 

 

John Donvan: 

Yeah. 

 

Male Speaker: 

That will result -- there's a videotape of every president since Richard Nixon saying 

they're going to solve this problem by getting waste and fraud out of the system.   

 

20:03:25 

 

I think it's going to reduce reimbursements.  And I think that's going to drive more and 

more of the better docs out of the system.  It's already happening.  Where I live in 

Sarasota, Florida -- 

 

John Donvan: 

I need a question, please. 

 

Male Speaker: 

Tell me why that's not going to happen and why it's not going to hurt the people at the 

bottom of our economic scale. 

 

John Donvan: 

Thank you.  Jonathan Cohn, who is against repeal. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Very quickly on this question about physician -- and what you're -- if I understand what 

you're saying, your last question there is about if we're going to spend less on Medicare, 

if Medicare is going to pay less, then why won't doctors just leave the system?  Well, 

we've done reductions in Medicare like this before.  We've done reductions larger than 

the ones we've done before.  And by the way, during the McCain campaign, Mr. Holtz-

Eakin, I remember, very vividly, saying that they were going to pay for their healthcare 

plan by enacting Medicare cuts that were even larger.  Now, I don't think he was trying to 

deprive Medicare patients of access.  But the fact is we've had these cuts before.  And 

every time it happens, you hear a lot of predictions, oh, my God, people are going to stop 

seeing Medicare patients.   

 

20:04:26 

 

And I understand that.  Look, my father is a surgeon.  He's in south Florida where you see 

people walking around with little dollar signs because there are cataract surgeries and, 

you know, that's what it's like.  And I understand that.  The fact is, every single time that 

we have done this, there have been predictions that doctors are going to flee the system.  

And you'll always get the anecdotal, of course, this doctor is leaving that -- but the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Medicare payment advisory committee looks at this.  There's a government, independent, 

not partisan authority that looks at these statistics to monitor this, because they want to 

make sure that's not happening.  There's a group called the Center for the Study of 

Healthcare System Change, which is the longest acronym ever for a think tank.  But 

believe me, they're very reliable, totally nonpartisan.  Everyone trusts -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

And what they all found is it never happens.  The doctors have not left the system. 

 

John Donvan: 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin.  Douglas Holtz-Eakin. 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

I want to, first, stipulate late, that the place they send old CBO directors to die is the 

Medicare payment advisory commission.  I've been there.   

 

20:05:21 

 

And prospectively, the MedPAC as well as the CMS actuary would say that the kinds of 

cuts and vision for Medicare will either lead to inadequate care, inability to see providers, 

or you can go put the money back in.  So there are no real changes in the business model 

that would allow a physician to practice more cheaply in Medicare, and that is why we 

should have fixed the problem instead of written the checks that is this system.  I think 

that is the fundamental indictment, we are not fixing the problem, and it is important to 

recognize that although there's all these bells and whistles that Jonathan likes to point to, 

there are lots of pages, they don't have any teeth.  They put something in called the 

"Independent Payment Advisory Board," that's like MedPAC on steroids, and -- but the 

law says they can't make beneficiaries pay more, they can't touch the hospitals and the 

nursing homes for 10 years, they can't mess with the way the docs get paid, so where's the 

big change in the way the delivery system's going to happen?  

 

John Donvan: 

Let's go to the audience for more questions.  Ma'am. 

 

20:06:23 

 

Female Speaker: 

Yes. 

 

John Donvan: 

Can you stand, please? 

 

Female Speaker: 

Hi. 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 

John Donvan: 

And just give a second for the camera to find you. 

 

Female Speaker: 

Yes.  I am [unintelligible] retired psychiatric social worker, and I haven't really heard 

much about the pain and suffering, it's cost, cost, and I know money's an issue, but I 

haven't heard the human side of this at all, and it's very dismaying. 

 

[applause] 

 

The other thing is, what about the issue of Americans are not taking very good care of 

themselves and they say 75 percent of the health issues of course are people's bad habits, 

or a lot of them. 

 

John Donvan: 

But do you think that's about a law? 

 

Female Speaker: 

Well, no, but, I mean, but a law, I mean, I think one of the things Obamacare wanted to 

do was try to get people to take care of themselves better and reward, you know, doctors 

who concentrate on prevention, and change of habits, and diet, and exercise.  And that’s a 
very important -- 

 

John Donvan:  

Paul Starr, is there any traction in that argument?  And I’ll come back to you, John. 
 

Paul Starr:  

Well, there are a number of measures in the bill that promote preventive services but -- 

and they are very important.   

 

20:07:28 

 

Medicare beneficiaries will get preventive services that have never been covered before.  

Those are some of the terrible mandates for private insurance that’s going to have to 
cover vaccinations, things like that.  But, you know, I’m not counting on that for big 
savings.  I don’t think the government really can change personal behavior in that 
profound a way, and I -- personally, actually, I don’t want to change that. 
 

John Donvan:  

I bet, John Shadegg, you agree with that point? 

 

John Shadegg:  

I don’t think government can change personal behavior, but I think law can change 
personal behavior because right now this system does not incentivize you or I to take care 

of ourselves. There are companies that have looked at this.  Safeway, for example, has 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

said, “You know what?  Having obese employees, having employees with out of control 
blood pressure, having employees with severe cholesterol is a severe problem," and so 

they’ve gone in and they have [unintelligible] -- 
 

20:08:24 

 

John Donvan:  

John, you’re talking about the system that existed prior to the reform, or you’re talking 
about the reform plan does not address these issues? 

 

John Shadegg:  

The reform plan says government’s going to do it.  What I’m saying is you have to 
incentivize people to do it, and the way you can incentivize people to do it is to give them 

skin  in the game.  Actually, Safeway cuts the cost of its employees’ healthcare if they 
lower their blood pressure, or if they consistently take their cholesterol medicine.  We 

can’t -- 
 

John Donvan: 

May I just say so does the Walt Disney Company, of which I am an employee. 

 

John Shadegg: 

There you go. 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

[laughter] 

 

John Shadegg: 

I take the human side of this argument very, very seriously.  When we were kids growing 

up, our parents bought indemnity plans, and the doctors cared about us because there was 

a physician-patient relationship.  We put the cash on their table.  The system we have 

created now divorces us completely from our doctor.  It says your doctor isn’t hired by 
you, your doctor is hired by a plan who was hired by your employer.   

 

20:09:25 

 

And that is what has caused medicine to -- caused damage to the physician-patient 

relationship, it’s caused a loss of control in costs, and it has caused the kind of 
devastation that you’re talking about.  I know people that can’t afford care because the 
insurance companies don’t give a damn about what it cares.  It’s time to stop shoveling 
money to them and put the power and control in your hands, not to give it to the 

government so Secretary Sebelius could write a thousand new regulations.  That’s not 
going to make it more personal, and then the plan I propose covers every single 

American, every one. 

 

John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

I think you agree with most of that. 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

[laughter] 

 

[applause] 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

[unintelligible] Do I agree that I -- I think that people sometimes are at the mercy of their 

insurance company?  Absolutely, and that is why I support this bill and don’t think we 
should repeal it.  I mean, remember right now your insurance company says you can’t get 
that treatment, you’re stuck.  Right now you’re moving between insurance companies -- 
 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

You know, you're -- right now you're moving between insurance company and insurance 

company, you change plans and tomorrow you have to change doctors because they’re 
not in the same network.   

 

20:10:23 

 

This plan allows people to stay on the same insurance plan longer and when that denial 

comes down, guess what?  You can appeal it.  What a notion.  You can actually go to an 

impartial person and say “You know what?  They’re saying I can’t get this premium 
because they think it’s too expensive.  I think I have the medical evidence that it works,” 
and the board says, “You know what?  You’re right.”  That’s a mandate.  That’s a 
regulation, and you know what?  It helps people. 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Donvan: 

Yeah.  You just raised your right hand.  Will you stand up and the mic will come to you, 

thanks. Can I ask you what you’re hearing so far that in any way changed your mind? 
 

Female Speaker: 

It hasn’t changed my mind.  It’s been a lot of the same rhetoric I think.  But I keep 
hearing always the proponents of repealing the law about consumer choice and way 

before this law they kept talking about consumer choice will lower costs.  And I want to 

ask you if you really believe that a parent with a child that needs heart surgery is going to 

choose the cheapest heart surgeon and the cheapest hospital.  

 

20:11:23 

 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 45 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

And when your father’s dying of prostate cancer they’re going to choose to not give four 
months of very expensive treatment and thus lower cost. 

 

John Donvan: 

That’s a question for the side arguing for repeal. 
 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

I’m going to give you a bad answer and I will hand it over to Mr. Shadegg.  This is what I 
would say to you. Healthcare is not a one thing.  It’s not just the circumstances tragic and 
threatening as you described.  Healthcare and where we spend this is an enormous range 

that involves elective procedures, it involves chronic conditions, it involves traumatic 

injury and we have a system that does not provide individuals with anything like the 

ability to manage their care, anything like information needed to choose from high and 

low value care and never gets them in a preventive way in a position to avoid being stuck 

with a tragic choice.   

 

20:12:24 

 

That’s wrong.  We need a system that they control all aspects of their life cycle up to 
those very moments.  And I have a great faith in the ability of the American people.  

They do it in every other aspect of their lives some of which are enormous, they have 

kids.  That’s a pretty life and death situation. 
 

John Donvan: 

Paul Starr who is against repeal. 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

I have great faith in the ability to do it. 

 

John Donvan: 

Paul Starr who is against repeal. 

 

Paul Starr: 

Well, I agree with the sympathies of the questioner that there’s something really 
fundamentally amiss here, this image of the patient as economic man.  How really out of 

touch it is with the conditions of illness.  How, in fact, it assumes a kind of marketplace 

where, for example, prices would be available.  Actually, you can’t find out what the 
prices are for different things. 

 

[applause] 

 

And in fact a hospital has 12 different prices for the same thing depending on who it’s 
treating. We don’t have a system of posted prices in healthcare.  Now, maybe you want to 
change all that.

20:13:24 

 

Maybe you want to transform it but you were in power for years and you didn’t do 
anything about it. 

 

John Donvan: 

John Shadegg. 

 

John Shadegg: 

Yeah.  The decision point that you referred to, once they’ve gotten sick, is not the right 
one.  The reality is people are economic beings and they do make economic decisions.  

Indeed, I proposed a bill in the United States Congress that would allow you if you live in 

New Jersey to buy a plan that was written and offered for sale in Arizona or Idaho or 

Illinois or Connecticut.  No, no.  Let me explain how it works.  You could buy that policy 

-- and the reason I wrote that bill is because the people in New Jersey today pay at least 

four times more than the people in Pennsylvania because of those strictures [spelled 

phonetically] of the law in New Jersey. Indeed, Americans who go to New Jersey are 

going to their friends that live in Pennsylvania and say, “What are you paying?  And 
they’re saying “Well, I’m paying one-fourth of what you’re paying.”  And people are 
actually buying health insurance by pretending they live in Pennsylvania when they really 

live in New Jersey because it costs one-fourth as much.   

 

20:14:27 

 

Now we heard the argument that nobody would shop but people really do shop.  But 

here’s why shopping -- ah -- if they can shop -- what makes me maddest about all of this-
- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

Female Speaker: 

[inaudible] 

 

John Donvan: 

To quote you, you’re saying from the audience, cheaper premiums do not mean cheaper 
healthcare.  John, respond to that. 

 

John Shadegg: 

The ability, for example, to buy across lines.  People are not going to pay, are not going 

to choose to pay cheaper premiums unless they have to.  What they’re going to do is pay, 
they’re going to spend as much as they can on healthcare and get the best product they 
can.  They won’t choose to buy a cheap policy, some may, but most people buy the most 
expensive policy they can.  In fact, that was a study done on my bill allowing across state 

line health insurance sales and indeed, no less than the Department of Health and Human 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Services said if you simply allowed cross state sales of health insurance we would have 

eight million fewer people uninsured in America today.   

 

20:15:29 

 

Now, here's the point.  It's not -- the key isn't that you will be able to get a cheaper policy.  

The problem is the insurance companies are cheating us right now.  They're charging too 

much because they don't have to compete. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay -- 

 

John Shadegg: 

The reality is -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Donvan: 

On the far right.  You're standing in the aisle and making yourself known. 

 

Female Speaker: 

Thank you.  Hi.  I know we're here to discuss to repeal or not to repeal.  But that is not 

the question.  I think the central question should be -- and it is also my question to you, 

what is our path to a truly universal, affordable healthcare system?  Because whether we 

have the Affordable Care Act or whether we have the status quo, both systems are asking 

us to put our faith in the private health insurance industry which is profit driven.  And life 

and death matters should not be decided by the profit motive.  So that what is the path -- 

 

[applause] 

 

20:16:21 

 

Female Speaker: 

What is the path to an improved Medicare system open to all? 

 

John Donvan: 

Repealing Obamacare is the question.  But given your passion and verve, I'd just like to 

give each side 30 seconds each to respond to that.  And either of you can take it from 

there. 

 

Paul Starr: 

This law reflects a conviction that we can regulate a private system, not just private 

insurers, but also private hospitals, private doctors, and achieve the goals that you're 

interested in, a universal system.  And in fact, really, if you look at other countries, 

they're not all government controlled.  They have many private insurance funds in many 

European countries and achieve a universal --

John Donvan: 

Thank you.  On this side.  Douglas Holtz-Eakin. 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

There's nothing about insurance companies, per se, that anyone should like.  But the 

alternative, a monopoly that you have to deal with, is completely inferior to having a 

vibrant insurance industry that has to compete for your business.   

 

20:17:24 

 

I would much rather force them to give me a decent service than have a mandate that I 

have to use the one that's supplied by the government.  The second thing is, remember, 

for those advocates of a single big national payer, a national payer cannot negotiate any 

better between one hospital in Wichita and another hospital in Wichita which is 

ultimately where you have to negotiate who can provide this care at the cheapest price.  

They can't do it any better than the guy in Wichita.  So there is literally no advantage to a 

national plan.  It's a charade. 

 

John Donvan: 

John Shadegg, your partner. 

 

John Shadegg: 

Your goal is my -- 

 

Female Speaker: 

[inaudible] 

 

John Donvan: 

All right.  Debaters are here on this one.  John Shadegg, very quickly. 

 

John Shadegg: 

Your goal is my goal.  Long ago, I embraced universal coverage.  One point we haven't 

talked about tonight very much is how many people are going to lose the coverage they 

have.  You said how do we get to that right healthcare system.  I'll tell you how.  Number 

one, allow the people that like their plan to keep their plan.  Number two, deal with the 

issue of the uninsured by giving them a refundable tax credit.   

 

20:18:25 

 

Give them cash -- 

 

John Donvan: 

John, you've made this point before so I'm going to -- in the interest of time, I'm going to 

move on.  One more question.  And, ma'am, purple scarf, yeah.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Female Speaker: 

My question is, why should we not trust our elected officials?  Why, if people have their 

lives in public service -- well, I mean, you were voted into office.  Why should we not?  I 

lived in Great Britain for 25 years.  I was a beneficiary of the National Health Service as 

well as private medicine.  But there was an implicit trust that my tax pounds from my 

paycheck would help subsidize healthcare. 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay. 

 

Female Speaker: 

But I trusted that they would, regardless of whether they were labor or conservative.  And 

same in this country, Republican, Democrats, we're all -- 

 

John Donvan: 

So your question is why be so suspicious and skeptical of the ability of the bureaucracy to 

do the job well.  I want to put that -- 

 

Female Speaker: 

Bureaucracy -- people who have devoted their lives to public service who are elected 

officials, because some Americans -- 

 

20:19:25 

 

John Donvan: 

The elected officials.  Let's put that to the side that's arguing to repeal. John Shadegg. 

 

John Shadegg: 

I think we should trust them.  However, in this instance, we didn't.  And point of fact, 

when Obamacare passed, it was opposed by roughly 54 percent of the American people.  

Each day it's opposed by somewhere closer to 60 percent of the people.  There is no poll 

out there yet that says that it's favored by more people than not.  But more importantly 

than that -- and this is a key point -- when a nation that is a democracy makes a radical 

change in public policy, it should be reflected not by the narrowest of consensus but by a 

very broad consensus.  When Social Security was adopted, more than 80 percent of the 

members of the Congress, House and Senate, voted for the creation of Social Security.  

When Medicare and Medicare were created, more than 70 percent of the members of 

Congress supported those programs.  When SCHIP was adopted, again, the numbers 

were well over 75 percent of the members of Congress. 

 

20:20:23 

 

John Donvan: 

Okay. 

 

John Shadegg: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

When this bill passed, it passed by the slimmest of margins.  In the House, 50.8 percent, 

purely partisan vote.  And without the kind of consensus that I think will make it 

sustainable. 

 

John Donvan: 

Jonathan Cohn. 

 

John Shadegg: 

If it were sustainable, we wouldn't be having this debate. 

 

John Donvan: 

Jonathan Cohn, 30 seconds. 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Okay.  Very quickly, the polls -- if you scratch those polls even a little bit, what you will 

find is that it's a country overall.  Do you like the healthcare reform?  Yes, no, about 

divided.  Ask the people who don't like it, do you think it should be repealed and just we 

should go back to the way we were, or make it stronger?  About half the people break off, 

say, “Oh, no, we want it to be stronger.”  And if you test the individual elements, they're 
wildly popular-- protection against pre-existing conditions, getting kids under 25 on 

parents’ insurance.  All of these things are wildly popular.  And yes, it's true, the 
Republican Party did not -- this was a closed vote.  You know why that is?  It's because 

we live in a world not like the one 20, 30 years ago, where you had a responsible 

Republican party, where you had moderate Republicans -- 

 

[talking simultaneously] 

 

John Shadegg: 

Oh.  Ooh! 

 

[applause] 

 

20:21:21 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

Just like, as my colleague said.  The ideas in this plan were virtually identical in the broad 

framework to what the Republicans were proposing just 12 years ago.  It's what Mitt 

Romney said.  This is not a radical plan. 

 

John Donvan: 

John Shadegg, equal time for you on that. 

 

John Shadegg: 

I think it's offensive to say that the Republican Party is irresponsible.  You know, I'm 

sorry.  I take offense at that.  I have offered healthcare reform bills every year I've been in 

Congress. There are many.  I'm sorry the woman over there didn't hear them.  Yes, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 - 7/8/2014

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Republicans passed the opportunity when they hold both majorities of Congress.  But 

quite frankly, we did not have the demand that we have now seen.  But how do you 

defend the fact that broad consensus is necessary to support this legislation?  Have you 

defended it other than to say -- other than to say, well, back then, the Republican Party 

was responsible, and now it's not.  That's really -- quite frankly, in the context of what 

happened last week, inappropriate. 

 

20:22:23 

 

Paul Starr: 

When you pass the Medicare prescription drug program -- 

 

John Donvan: 

Paul Starr. 

 

Paul Starr: 

When you pass the Medicare prescription drug program, the polls ran two to one against 

it among seniors and the general population.  Eighty percent of people in polls said this is 

too complicated.  You did it anyway. 

 

John Donvan: 

And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  And here's where 

we are.  We are about to hear brief closing remarks from each of the debaters in turn.  

They will be two minutes each.  And it's their last chance to try to change your minds to 

their point of view. Our motion is "Repeal Obamacare."  You've been asked to vote once.  

And we'll ask you to vote again in just a couple of minutes.  But first, round three.  

Round three, closing statements from each debater in turn.  They will be brief.  And first, 

to speak against our motion, “Repeal Obamacare,” against repeal, Paul Starr, professor at 
Princeton University, cofounder and coeditor of the American Prospect and Pulitzer Prize 

winning author of “The Social Transformation of American Medicine.” 
 

20:23:24 

 

Paul Starr: 

Thank you.  Two months ago, the editor of an Austrian newspaper, a conservative, by the 

way, asked me how Americans could possibly oppose giving health insurance to the 

millions who don't have it.  To Europeans across the political spectrum, it's unthinkable 

to withhold health insurance, just as we would regard it as unthinkable to deny an 

education to children.  The Austrians, the French, the Germans, who have excellent 

medical care, don't become uninsurable when they get ill.  They don't get locked into a 

job for fear of losing health coverage. Universal coverage makes it more secure, and it 

actually makes them more free.  But every time the issue of universal coverage has arisen 

here, the opponents have used innuendo and fear to defeat health reforms that are 

common to every other advanced democracy.   

 

20:24:19 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 

And last year, we finally broke through that drum beat of fear with moderate legislation 

and to creating a more just and efficient system to cover the excluded and create 

mechanisms to slow the growth in costs.  Repealing the law would mean denying 

coverage to more than 30 million people.  It would mean repealing the laws' protections 

against abusive insurance practices, some of which have already gone into effect like 

barring the rescission of policies just because the subscriber gets sick.  It would mean 

giving up a whole series of cost-containment measures that show a lot of promise for 

reign in medical inflation.  But even more importantly, repeal would be a concession of 

political helplessness in the face of a problem that has nagged at the national conscience 

for a century.  It would be a confession that we simply are not capable of the elementary 

decency toward the sick that characterizes every other advanced democracy. There are 

surely changes that should be made in the law.  And it can be made.  But it would be an 

unspeakable tragedy for millions of people if we were to repeal it. 

 

20:25:24 

 

[applause] 

 

John Donvan: 

Thank you, Paul Starr.  Our motion is "Repeal Obamacare."  And here to speak for the 

motion, for repeal, John Shadegg, former eight-term Congressman from Arizona and a 

Senior Fellow at the Goldwater Institute. 

 

John Shadegg: 

The current system is broken.  There is no question about it.  It's broken because it costs 

too much, it's broken because there are too many people who don't have insurance, and 

it's tragically broken because some people are denied care because they have a chronic 

illness or preexisting condition.  We need to address those problems, and there are lots of 

reforms that we can to address them.  We can allow group pooling.  We can force the 

insurance companies to become cost conscious and to have to compete with each other.  

We can give you control over your health insurance.  We can move away from third party 

payer systems.  And we can begin to redo the system.  But we don't have to say that it's 

not universal care.  Indeed, my legislation and other legislation that Republicans have 

offered provide universal coverage.   

 

20:26:21 

 

My legislation says you give every single American a tax credit.  For the poor, you give 

them a refundable tax credit, an amount of money.  In the Coburn legislation and the 

Ryan legislation, you write specific dollar amounts for people to buy health insurance, 

and it's cash in their hands to go buy a coverage that they choose.  So we achieve 

universal coverage, every single American.  You can do universal enrollment as I 

described, where you're automatically enrolled in that process.  We can deal with the 

problem of the uninsured without forcing a million Americans who like their current 

coverage to lose it, which is what Obamacare will do.  You will force millions of 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 53 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Americans to lose the coverage they currently have and they currently like.  And we can 

deal with the problem of preexisting conditions.  I had heart bypass surgery.  I have a 

preexisting condition.  I care about this issue.  I have an older sister -- my oldest sister, 

who has breast cancer.  No one should be denied healthcare because they have a 

preexisting condition.  But we can do that without forcing everybody out of the coverage 

they have now. 

 

20:27:24 

 

But rather by creating high risk pools that are funded by all the other insurance 

companies or by government, and helping those who are in need because they have high 

risks.  Americans will happily pay to support people who have that kind of condition 

because they don’t know when they will have it next.  High risk pools will work for those 
with preexisting conditions. 

 

John Donvan:  

John -- John Shadegg, your time is up.  Thank you very much.  

 

[applause] 

 

Our motion is, "Repeal Obamacare."  And to speak in his closing remarks against the 

motion, Jonathan Cohn, senior editor at the New Republic, Senior Fellow at Demos, and 

author of "Sick:  The Untold Story of America’s Healthcare Crisis and the People Who 
Pay the Price." 

 

Jonathan Cohn: 

There was a question at some point that talked about the human side to this, and I wanted 

to just take this and say that’s where I started.  About 15 years ago I started interviewing 
people all over the country, and I met people who had their own firsthand experiences 

with the healthcare system, and I remember very, very vividly a man in upstate New 

York 

 

20:28:22 

 

who had a good job, a good college education, was a defense contractor, he lost that job, 

he got the job back, but without benefits, and because of that, two years his wife who was 

ill did not get any medical visits, ended up she had cancer, it went undiagnosed, she died, 

and the family had to declare bankruptcy.  For me, hearing that story and literally 

hundreds like it is where this all starts for me.  This is a problem we have had in this 

country for a long time.  It is a problem that keeps getting worse.  Two years ago we had 

a presidential election. And we debated, what are we going to do about this?  One, 

President Obama won, the Democrats  got in and this was job number one.  They reached 

out to the Republicans.  They took ideas that Republicans had for years claimed as their 

own and said, "All right, we’ll meet you halfway, and we’ll try -- we will come up with a 
plan that builds on your ideas and our ideas and we’ll work together."  And the 
Republicans walked away, and they said, "Fine.  We have to go it alone, we’ll go it 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 54 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

alone."  But they kept the same ideas, they took the best from left and right, and what did 

they get?  It’s not a perfect plan, but it is a plan that will mean 30 million people have 
health insurance.   

 

20:29:23 

 

It will mean that the insurance people have will be good insurance that will cover what 

they need.  It will mean that people will have financial assistance.  Congressman Shadegg 

never tells you this part of his plan, but the credit he would offer people isn’t enough to 
pay for a good plan and people with pre-existing conditions, it would basically work out 

to second class insurance for second class people. 

 

[applause] 

 

This is the plan they're talking about.  The cost control, not perfect, it could be better, 

fine, as Doug Holtz-Eakin, himself, said, these are the same ideas, we all agree on them, 

let's work together and double them down.  But repeal Obamacare?  Tom Harkin said, 

"This is a starter house, it’s got a good foundation, and it’s got room for expansion."  I 
say let’s keep that foundation, let’s build onto it, and let’s not repeal Obamacare, let’s not 
start over, let’s go forward.  
 

John Donvan: 

Thank you, Jonathan Cohn. 

 

[applause] 

 

Our motion is "Repeal Obamacare."  And finally, to speak for the motion, for repeal, 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who is President of the American Action Forum and a former 

Director of the Congressional Budget Office and former advisor to John McCain. 

 

20:30:28 

 

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

I thank you for listening tonight and this is ultimately a debate about our future and I 

don’t think anyone should question the aspirations or good will of either side of this stage 
in terms of what one would like in affordable coverage for every American and access to 

high quality care.  Those values are shared.  What is at issue is what is the best way to go 

forward and to try to build on this foundation, one that is riddled with financial cancer 

and one that has only window dressing at attempting to deal with the real problems of the 

American healthcare system is a dangerous place to begin and it should be repealed in 

favor of a real future of the American healthcare system.  Now, we’ve heard that 
somehow the Republicans got all their ideas and I believe that the vigorous debate tonight 

would stipulate that’s not the case.  This is not something on which we can build a future.  
This is a dangerous beginning.   

 

20:31:22

It does not fix the broken programs that are threatening the financial future of the United 

States. Medicare and Medicaid are not touched by this program.  They are important 

pieces of the social welfare system in the United States.  They deserved the attention of 

the healthcare reform.  They were dismissed as unimportant.  Instead we got a strategy to 

double down on those broken failures and try to write checks to paper over a broken 

system and in the process we are threatening the very future of this country, threatening 

the freedom and prosperity of Americans on which the healthcare system and everything 

else will be built.  And we are most tragically doing it at the expense of our youngest and 

most vulnerable, our kids.  They didn’t get a vote.  They aren’t going to be able to believe 
what we have done to them when they grow up. They will pay the bills now.  They will 

pay the bills later.  They won’t see higher quality care. They’ll see more expensive care.  
And we will, in the process, take many of them into systems that ostensibly give them 

“access” but where no physician can treat them, no hospital will want them in their beds 
and they will not get good care and they will be broke to boot.   

 

20:32:30 

 

Repeal Obamacare today. 

 

[applause] 

 

John Donvan: 

Thank you, Douglas Holtz-Eakin and that concludes our closing statements and now it’s 
time to learn which side has argued best.  We’re having you vote twice, once before the 
debate and again after the debate and we’re going to get the results and choose the 
winner.  We’re asking you to go to the keypad at your seat.  Our motion is “Repeal 
Obamacare.”  If you agree with the motion after hearing the debate, push number one.  If 
you disagree, push number two.  If you remain undecided or became undecided, push 

number three.  And we’ll have the results of that vote in about 90 seconds but before we 
get to that, I just want to thank both teams for coming to this debate with the kind of 

arguments that they did.  We aspire to ideas here and we certainly heard them tonight.   

 

20:33:22 

 

Thank you to all of our debaters for the way that they conducted themselves and did this-- 

 

[applause] 

 

Thank you also to those of you in the audience who asked questions.  I like your passion.  

I’m glad that question got in there.  Thank you for doing that, for forcing that issue.  
We’d like to first of all thank the American Clean Skies Foundation for helping to 
underwrite this season of debates.  This season we have a theme throughout the winter 

and the spring for all five of our debates.  That theme is “America’s House Divided” and 
we are focusing on themes that reflect this division, this basic philosophical division in 

our society.  Our next debate is Tuesday, February 15th.  The motion on that Tuesday 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 56 - 7/8/2014 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

night is “Two Party System is Making America Ungovernable.”  Arguing for the motion 
are New York Times op/ed columnist David Brook and co-founder and editor-in-chief of 

Huffington Post, Arianna Huffington.   

 

20:34:20 

 

Against the motion we have Zev Chaffets who is a journalist and he’s the former director 
of the government press office in Israel where the system is a parliamentary system and 

works differently.  His partner arguing against the motion is P. J. O’Rourke, a political 
satirist and author of “Don’t vote, it just encourages the bastards.” 
 

[laughter]

been given the results.  Remember you have been asked to vote twice in this debate, once 

before and once again at the end.   

 

20:35:22 

 

And the team that has changed the most minds is declared our winner.  And here it is.  

Our motion is "Repeal Obamacare."  Before the debate, 17 percent were for repeal.  47 

percent against, 36 percent undecided.  After the debate, 22 percent are for “Repeal 
Obamacare.”  That's up five percent.  Seventy-two percent are against.  That's up 25 
percent.  Six percent are undecided.  The motion, “Repeal Obamacare” is defeated.  
That's it for us at Intelligence Squared.  Thank you from John Donvan, and we'll see you 

next time.
