Sometimes when we set out to fix what is broken, we can argue not only about what the 
fix should be, but actually about what the problem is.  And when it comes to American 
public education, the diagnosis has been offered that our schools suffer from a lack of 
consistent standards coast to coast about what our kids should leave school 
knowing.  And the fix that has been adopted in a number of states in the last few years 
is a set of standards called the Common Core, which have become the most contentious 
issue in American education in the last generation, with disputes about who drew up 
these standards, whether they result in kids being over tested and even whether 
standards make sense.  Do they have to be common?  Are we fixing the right problem?

Well, that sounds like the makings of a debate.  So let’s have it.  Yes or no to this 
statement, Embrace the Common Core.  A debate from Intelligence Squared US.  I’m 
John Donvan.  We are at the Kaufman Music Center in New York City.  We have four 
superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing two against two on this specific motion, 
Embrace the Common Core. As always, our debate will go in three rounds and then our 
live audience here in New York City votes to choose the winner, and only one side 
wins.  Our motion is Embrace the Common Core.  Let’s please meet our 
debaters.  Please welcome first, Carmel Martin. 
 
[applause] 
 
And Carmel, you are arguing for the motion, Embrace the Common Core.  You are right 
now at the Center for American Progress.  
 
18:51:18 
 
You’re an executive VP there for policy.  You were in the Obama Administration four 
years as Assistant Secretary at the Department of Education.  Carmel you have and will 
argued the standards were, the Common Core standards, were first gathered together 
by the states, but President Obama then endorsed them and in the eyes of many of his 
opponents, he them tainted them and made them unpopular.  The question we have for 
you is back at the beginning of this, did anybody see that there would be a political 
backlash with the administration’s endorsement? 
 
Carmel Martin: 
Well honestly John, we weren’t thinking about political backlash.  We were thinking 
about what was best for kids, but I do agree that the issue has become a little bit of a 
political football, which I think is unfortunate and I hope people will focus on what’s 
best for children. 
 
John Donvan: 
So no football tonight then.  
 
[laughter] 
 
And your partner is, Carmel? 
 
Carmel Martin: 
My partner is my sometimes opponent actually, always my friend and distinguished 
colleague, the brilliant Michael Petrilli. 
 
John Donvan: 
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Petrilli.

John Donvan: 
Michael, that was a very nice introduction. 
 
18:52:24 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
I was hoping for "good-looking," but I'll take brilliant. That's good -- that's okay. 
 
John Donvan: 
[laughs] 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
You are not only good looking. You are also president of the education policy think tank, 
the Thomas Fordham Institute. You're an executive editor of Education Next. The 
Common Core, as everybody in -- who knows the issue knows is that it's not an easy left-
right issue, that there are people on both sides, from both ends of the spectrum. And a 
case in point in that is that your debate partner, as pointed out, is a liberal -- 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Affirmative. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- while you represent a conservative think tank. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Right. 
 
John Donvan: 
However, recently, a number of conservative governors have pulled out of the Common 
Core. So, is it -- is it starting to get a little lonely on the conservative side? 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Perhaps a little lonelier, but it's important to know that still half of the nation's 
Republican governors are supportive of the Common Core. So, lonelier, but I am far 
from alone. 
 
John Donvan: 
And you're going to try to pull some people over to your side tonight.

Our motion is Embrace the Common Core. We have two debaters who are arguing 
against this motion. First, please welcome Carol Burris.  
 
[applause] 
 
Carol, you are -- you are principal. You are the -- the educator on the stage tonight. 
You're principal of South Side High School in Rockville Center in New York. 2013, a New 
York High School Principal of the Year. Congratulations on that. You're also the author of 
three books. And one of these books was called "Opening the Common Core," at which 
time you were supportive of the standards. Now you are arguing on the other side. 
What do your students at -- at South Side make of this whole controversy over the 
Common Core? 
 
Carol Burris: 
Well, over half of my ninth graders last year refused to take the Common Core test 
when they were in eighth grade, with their parents' permission. So, I think it's safe to 
say they're not fans. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  
 
[laughter] 
 
I have a feeling maybe some of them are here. Thank you, Carol Burris. And your partner 
tonight is?

Carol Burris:

Rick, you're at the American Enterprise Institute. You are an education policy studies 
resident scholar and director of that section. You have a blog called "Rick Hess Straight 
Up” at Education Week. Like your opponent, Mike, you are an executive editor for 
Education Next. And it's also interesting to note, you and your opponent Mike co-wrote 
a book in 2006. So, are there no more collaborations down -- down the road for the two 
of you? 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
You know, John, we wrote that book on No Child Left Behind after Mike -- who had been 
an enthusiast -- came to share my more measured take. I'm hopeful that history will 
eventually repeat itself.

Our motion is Embrace the Common Core. This is a debate. There will be a winner and a 
loser by a vote of the live audience. By the time the debate has ended, you will have 
been asked to vote twice -- once before the debate and once again after the debate. 
And the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be 
declared our winner. Let's go to the preliminary vote. If you go to the keypads at your 
seat. We're going to start with that. I'll remind you -- you want to pay attention to keys 
1, 2, and 3. You push 1 if you agree with the motion "Embrace the Common Core." If 
you're with this team. You push 2 if you're against it. If you do not agree that we should 
embrace the Common Core, you push #2. And that's this team. If you're undecided, 
which is a perfectly honorable position of which to start this, you push #3. If you push 
the wrong key, just correct yourself. The system will lock in your last vote. Looks like 
everybody's got it, so let's move on to Round 1.

Our motion is Embrace the Common Core. Round 1, opening statements by each 
debater in turn. They will be seven minutes each. Speaking first for the motion, Embrace 
the Common Core, Mike Petrilli. You can make your way to the lectern. Michael Petrilli, 
President of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute. He is research fellow at Stanford’s 
Hoover Institution and author of "The Diverse Schools Dilemma." Ladies and gentlemen, 
Michael Petrilli.  
 
[applause] 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Thank you very much. It's a real honor to be here. I was just surprised -- I just saw Rick 
press the undecided button. So, that was interesting. We'll see how that goes. It is such 
an honor to be here today. Let me tell you a little bit about what our game plan is, that -
- Carmel and I. We've been together all afternoon, we've been scheming about this.  I 
will start by talking about what it means to embrace the Common Core.  Then I will talk 
about some of the problems in our education system and frankly in previous waves of 
reform that the Common Core is trying to address.  
 
18:57:23 
 
Carmel then is going to talk about the process of developing the Common Core, the role 
that educators play, the role that evidence played, as well as talk about some of the 
equity issues that are at stake here, how the Common Core can help to narrow the 
achievement gap.  Now, what you won't hear us argue is, first of all, that Common Core 
is going to solve all of our nation's educational problems because, of course, it 
won't.  You're not going to hear us say that the Common Core are perfect.  They were 
not handed down from Mount Sinai, they are not set in stone, right, or we're going to 
hear plenty of concerns about this individual standard or that individual standard, so 
you won't hear us say that they're perfect.  And you're not going to hear us say that it's 
all going perfectly out there around the country, because, of course, it's not all going 
perfectly out there around the country.  This is a big country, 50 million kids in public 
schools, 100,000 of those schools, and like any ambitious reform, it's a work in progress, 
okay?  But what you are going to hear us argue is that despite all of that you should still 
embrace the Common Core.  
 
18:58:25 
 
Now, why is that?  Why should you embrace the Common Core?  And what does that 
mean?  In our view, to embrace the Common Core is, first of all, to embrace the idea 
that our schools should have standards, all right, that doesn't sound so radical, and that 
the standards that we have should be set at a high enough level to indicate that our 
students are ready for what comes next.  And that means kids graduating from high 
school, that they're either ready to go and succeed in college or to go and get a good

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - 9/10/2014 

paying job.  Now, what you might have to understand is that this is a radical departure 
from how we used to do this.  States did have standards before the Common Core, but, 
by and large, they were set at a very, very low level.  And so what that meant is that 
students could meet those standards, they could pass the standardized tests connected 
to those standards, but it didn't mean that they were ready for success later on.  In fact, 
in many states it didn't even mean that they were at grade level.  And so we had a 
system that was giving a lot of false information out there to students, to teachers, to 
parents alike. 
 
18:59:22 
 
So, to embrace the Common Core is to say, "Let's embrace standards that are set at this 
college and career ready level."  It's also to say that we should embrace the idea of 
moving to next generation assessments, right, tests that measure these standards, that 
are worlds better than the tests that we've been living with for the past two 
decades.  Many of us in this room as parents or as teachers, we know that there has 
been this huge focus on standardized testing in this country.  And unfortunately, by and 
large, those tests have been terrible, fill in the blank, multiple choice tests, tests that 
don't do a good job measuring what students know and that encourage very low level 
kind of teaching and learning in the classroom.  But now, after four years, we're finally 
getting to the point where there are new assessments coming connected to the 
Common Core that are going to be much more like advanced placement exams or 
international baccalaureate exams like the ones that Carol uses in her school, and this is 
our chance to move to those assessments.  So, if you embrace the Common Core, its 
high standards, its next generation assessments, that's what we are moving towards. 
 
19:00:23 
 
Now, what's the problem we're trying to address?  Every study that's ever been done on 
American education comes to pretty much the same conclusion.  It's not that our 
schools are failing, though some are failing, but on the large, it's not that schools are 
failing, it's that our schools, by and large, are mediocre when compared to schools 
overseas.  They're in the middle of the pack.  They're not the best schools in the world, 
they're not the worst schools in the world.  They're in the middle of the pack.  And it's 
not just our demographics.  It's not just because we have a lot of childhood poverty, 
though we do. Our rich kids are in the middle of the pack compared to other rich kids 
around the world, poor kids, middle class kids, high achievers, low 
achievers.  Throughout the education system, it's this concern around mediocrity.  And 
we've known this for 30 years.  And we have been working hard at trying to address 
that.  And we've made some progress, right?  Poor and minority and low achieving kids 
today are reading and doing math two to three grade levels ahead of where they were 
back in the 1990s.  That's incredible progress.   
 
19:01:20

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - 9/10/2014 

 
And our public education system deserves credit for making that progress.  And almost 
certainly it was because back in the '90s and 2000s, states decided to set standards, to 
have tests that measured those standards, and to have accountability systems to make 
those standards stick.  And it -- again, we've made real progress.  But because the 
standards were set so low and because the tests have been so easy, all of the focus has 
been getting the lowest performing kids over that very low standard, right?  And that's 
led to great progress for the kids at the bottom but it hasn't done much for the kids at 
the middle or the kids at the top because they were so far ahead of those standards that 
it didn't get much traction with them.  At the same time, it's come along with a lot of 
unintended consequences, and we know about those, too, teaching to the test, 
narrowing of the curriculum, driving out a lot of the joy that we want to have in our 
schools, okay?  And again, Carol, Rick, many others have been very eloquent on this 
point.  
 
19:02:16 
 
This is our chance to embrace the Common Core, is to fix all of that, to move to a system 
with much higher standards but also better tests that give better information but that 
also encourage better teaching and learning in the classroom.  Carmel and I had a 
chance today to meet with a group of teachers, many of them are here in the room 
tonight, to tell us how it's going with Common Core.  And it's not perfect. There's issues, 
and there is bumps in the road, but they talked about these higher expectations for 
their students that some of these kids, they couldn't -- you know, four years ago they 
couldn't believe that the kids could perform at the level that they're performing now, 
but these higher standards have pushed them in that direction.  Now, Rick and Carol are 
going to say that we should not embrace the Common Core, and I don't know if they're 
willing to hug the Common Core or kiss the Common Core or fist bump the Common 
Core, so I'm not -- we'll see what their position it, but what do they want?  Do they want 
us to go back to the old standards, the ones that were set way too low, that gave 
everybody this false impression that everything was fine?  Do they want us to stick with 
the -- still the standardized tests, these rinky-dink standardized tests that we've lived 
with for 20 years?  
 
19:03:24 
 
Do they want to follow the example of Oklahoma, the one state in the country that has 
repealed the Common Core and replaced it with something else right away, and in 
Oklahoma today, today in Oklahoma schools, teachers did not know what standards 
they were supposed to teach to.  They don't know six months from now which tests 
they're going to be held accountable to, but I guarantee you it's not going to be one of 
these next generation assessments because there's no time and there's no money for 
that.  It's going to be one of these rinky-dink assessments instead.  Lots more to talk

about throughout this debate, but for all of those reasons, this is why you should vote to 
"Embrace the Common Core."  Thank you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mike Petrilli. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that is our motion, "Embrace the Common Core."  And now here to speak against 
the motion, Carol Burris.  She is an award-winning principal at South Side High in 
Rockville Centre, New York.  She also blogs on "Answer Sheet" in the Washington 
Post.  Ladies and gentlemen, Carol Burris. 
 
19:04:18 
 
[applause] 
 
 
Carol Burris: 
Good evening, and thank you for inviting us to this very important debate about the 
quality of the Common Core standards.  I say "quality" because this isn't a debate about 
whether or not we need standards.  Of course we do.  And this isn't a debate about 
whether or not schools should improve.  That's a given.  Rather, this is a debate that 
asks whether or not the Common Core standards are so remarkable and so sound that 
we should embrace them as the standards by which every American child is both 
educated and judged.  In a little while, Rick is going to explain the flaws in the design of 
the standards.  As a lifelong educator, I'm going to explain the flaws in the standards 
themselves.  Let's begin with kindergarten.  Listen while I read this Common Core 
kindergarten standard.  
 
19:05:19 
 
 "Compose and decompose numbers from 11 to 19 into 10 ones and some further 
ones.  Example, by using objects or drawings and record each composition or 
decomposition by a drawing or equation.  Example, 18 equal 10 plus eight.  Understand 
that these numbers are composed of 10 ones and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, 
eight, or nine ones."  Now, I ask you, should that be a standard for a five-year-old? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Or to put it another way, do the standards know and match what we know now about 
childhood development?  Well, in 2010, when the standards were first rolled out, 
experts said, "No."  Five hundred early childhood experts, pediatricians, psychologists,

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - 9/10/2014 

researchers, and teachers found the Common Core standards to be so developmentally 
inappropriate that they called for their suspension in grades K through 3.  
 
19:06:24 
 
Back to Louisa Moats, one of the few early childhood experts that were on the team 
that created the literacy standard, is now one of their most outspoken 
critics.  Why?  Because the Common Core standards disregard decades of research on 
early reading development and instead yank up difficulty levels at every grade.  So, how 
could the developers of the Common Core get it so wrong?  The Common Core 
standards were built backwards from grade 12 down to pre-K.  But kids don't grow 
backwards, they grow forward, and their development is unique and uneven.  The 
Common Core requiring that kindergarteners count from one to 100 by ones and 10s, 
even though we know that most five years old can count to 20, is as silly as expecting all 
two-year-olds to be potty trained.  
 
19:07:20 
 
Research did not guide the development of the Common Core standards.  And then 
there is the math.  Most of the time, when we think of standards, we think about what 
topics should be taught at different grade levels.  But the Common Core goes beyond 
and seeks to influence how math should be taught, often in confusing ways.  Here’s a 
first grade example.  “Use strategies such as counting on, making ten. Example, eight 
plus six equals eight plus two plus four equal ten plus four equal 14, decomposing the 
number leading to a 10.  Example, 13 minus four equal 13 minus three minus one equal 
ten minus one equal nine, and creating equivalent but easier or known sums.  Example, 
adding six plus seven, by creating the known equivalent, six plus six plus one equal 
twelve plus one equal thirteen.”  
 
19:08:19 
 
Now, when you listen to that, are we surprised that we have created complicated 
homework problems that comedians joke about and that make children cry?  This is why 
parents and teachers are rebelling.  In one year, in the bluest of states, California and 
New York, the Common Core has moved from majority approval to majority 
disapproval.  In one year, teacher support for the Common Core has dropped 30 
points.  This is not a Tea Party rebellion.  This is a parent rebellion and it’s happening 
because the Common Core has moved from paper to practice, from the ideal to the 
real.  And then yes, there are the tests.  Even as the consortia developed national tests, 
New York State is giving Common Core tests twice.  And guess what, they’re multiple 
choice tests and they don’t look anything like the IB.

Results have been devastating for our special education students, our English language 
learners, and our students of poverty.  And they’re based on arbitrary measures of 
proficiency.  Bad test scores have consequences for kids.  Fourteen states require that 
third graders be left back based on poor reading scores.  Kids are put in remedial 
classes. Test scores decide who gets into gifted programs and into competitive 
schools.  High school graduation rates are expected to plummet.  The Carnegie 
Corporation has predicted that the six year drop out rate will double, from 15 percent to 
30 percent.  And the four year graduation rate will drop from 75 percent to 53 
percent.  We already have a preview. The GED test was the line to the Common Core.  It 
dropped 19 points to a passing rate of 53 percent.  Here’s the bottom line:  
 
19:10:24 
 
There is no evidence, none, that the Common Core standards and its tests will actually 
increase student learning.  And as we engage in this experiment, we may very well hurt 
the kids who need our support the most.  And so I urge you to vote no at the end of this 
debate, because if we embrace the Common Core, we are embracing a set of flawed 
standards that will mark as failures more than half of our kids.  And your kids and your 
grandkids deserve better than that.  Thank you.

John Donvan: 
Thank you Carol Burris.  And a reminder of where we are, we are halfway through the

Core.”

Carmel Martin: 
Thank you John and thanks to Intelligence Squared for bringing this debate here tonight 
and including me in it.  I want to start by telling you the story of Janelle, a young woman 
from Philadelphia who I spoke to recently.  And whose story embodies why I feel so 
strongly that the Common Core is a crucial step forward for American 
education.  Janelle is an African American woman from the north side of

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - 9/10/2014 

Philadelphia.  Her parents believed in the power of education to transform lives.  They 
had one overriding message for their daughter:  Do well in school and you will be the 
first person in the family to go to college.  
 
19:12:20 
 
Janelle got the message. She worked hard. She took honors courses. She got all As. She 
was her vice president of her senior class. And she graduated in the top of her class. She 
was number three in her class. She diligently applied to college, and she and her parents 
ecstatically celebrated when she not only got into college, a public four-year institution 
in Pennsylvania, but got a full scholarship. But it wasn't very long after going to college 
before she realized that she had been duped. The As she'd earned in her honors courses 
in high school seemed to bear little relationship with what it took to succeed in her 
college-level courses. In subject after subject, she struggled, becoming more and more 
dejected. She explained to me how one of the problems that she encountered was that 
in high school, her teachers helped her translate her textbooks. 
 
19:13:16 
 
But when she got to college, her professors expected her to be able to do that for 
herself and then analyze the information, as opposed to just understanding it. And her -- 
she didn't have those skills. They hadn't taught them to her in her high school. As a 
result -- as a result, Janelle's GPA dropped and she lost eligibility for her scholarships. 
Now, the good news is, she did -- she has managed to return to college as a sophomore. 
She was able to fill the gap left by her scholarships with student loans. Many children in 
her -- in her situation would have given up and dropped out. The Common Core is for 
Janelle and for the thousands of students who are giving it their all but not getting their 
money's worth. Now, I agree with something Rick has said before, which is that 
standards are meaningless unless they're translated into effective instruction. As Mike 
noted, the Common Core is not a silver bullet for all that ails our education system. But 
it is an essential building block.  
 
19:14:21 
 
And for students like Janelle who, for generations, have been shortchanged by the old, 
failed system, new standards will help ensure they are never left behind again. We know 
what we were doing before wasn't working. We see remediation rates as high as one in 
four college students who are not ready for college-level material. And that translates, 
just here in New York, to $80 million in wasted resources that could be spent on other 
supports for our students to be successful. And that doesn't even address the students 
like Janelle who are not in remediation, but are struggling with college level content. 
Some schools, like the one that Carol runs, have adopted International Baccalaureate 
programs or advanced placement courses to supplement the old state standards, but

we can't rely on visionary principles like Carol -- or a patchwork of programs to close our 
nation's gaping achievement gaps or prepare future generations to compete with China.  
 
19:15:21 
 
Now, I'd like to cut -- clear up a couple misconceptions about the Common Core that 
had been promoted by the Glenn Becks of the world. First the Common Core was not 
developed in secret and was not developed by the federal government. This was an 
initiative led by Democratic Governor Markell of Delaware and Republican Governor 
Sonny Perdue of Georgia. Back in 2008, virtually all of the governors, with the exception 
of Rick Perry and Sarah Palin, were strongly supportive of it. Unlike the previous 
patchwork of standards, the Common Core was developed with significant input from 
educators and content experts, like the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. 
The authors consulted teacher unions, the civil rights community, college leaders, and 
business leaders. The standards were revised based on over 10,000 comments from the 
general public. And contrary to the assertion of the opposition, most teachers are not 
opposed to the standards, and indeed strongly support them.  
 
19:16:22  
 
Now, I appreciate that there has been a great deal of controversy about the way the 
standards have been implemented and concerns with how test scores are being used in 
our education system. I think those concerns are real. And we should -- we should 
address them. But -- and teachers, when asked about the standards in the context of 
accountability -- particularly accountability for themselves -- their own performance -- 
they're hesitant about the standards. But despite these concerns, a Winston poll in early 
August revealed that two out of three teachers approved of the adoption and believed 
they are what their students need to be successful. And when implementation is done 
well, which I strongly believe requires that you use teachers to help you develop an 
implementation plan -- teachers feel excited about the standards and believe they have 
more, not less, freedom in their classroom. John, a high school geometry teacher, said it 
better than I could: 
 
19:17:17 
 
“The old standards gave teachers a set of specific and sometimes constricting direction 
on where to turn, when to turn, and how fast to go.  The Common Core standards 
instead give us mileposts to aim for, tell us where we should end up but not how to get 
there.” And this was something that Mike and I heard loud and clear this afternoon 
when we were talking to teachers from right here in New York.  Later in the debate, I'm 
sure we'll talk more about the challenges of implementation and the need for 
commonsense use of tests.  Those are important issues.  But because we have 
challenges doesn't mean that we should turn our backs on the incredible work that's 
been done over the last four years here in New York and around the country to lay the

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - 9/10/2014 

groundwork for the implementation of these standards.  I think there are commonsense 
ways we can and should make implementation go more smoothly.  As Mike said, I think 
that the Common -- new assessments aligned to the Common Core will address one of 
the chief complaints of teachers and students alike, fill in the bubble tests. 
 
19:18:20 
 
Because the Common Core requires children become problem solvers and good 
communicators, the new tests aligned to them will measure complex thinking, reading, 
writing, communications, and problem solving kids' skills.  As a result, teachers will no 
longer be driven to narrow the curriculum or teach to a bad test.  There have always 
been standards and always will be standards. There have always been tests and there 
always will be tests.  It's time to get them right.  For that reason, I ask you to "Embrace 
the Common Core."

Thank you, Carmel Martin, speaking for the motion.  And now, to speak against the 
motion in the final statement of the opening round, please welcome Rick Hess.  He is a 
resident scholar and director of educational policy studies at the American Enterprise 
Institute, author of several books on education including, "Cage Busting Leadership."

Fredrick Hess: 
It's a pleasure to be here with you this evening to talk about this issue.  
 
19:19:20 
 
 Notice that we -- I am not here to argue that the Common Core is malicious or 
atrocious.  I am here to argue that we should not embrace it.  Now, you might wonder 
why.  I heard Mike try to recharacterize the Common Core as meaning that one is for 
standards, for high standards, and for great tests.  Well, if that's the Common Core, then 
I'm for it, too.  But that's actually not the Common Core.  That is Mike trying to turn the 
Common Core into a vague principle that we like good stuff.  Carmel talked about 
Janelle.  I got to tell you, if you think there was any state in the Union, circa 2009, that 
said, "It's state standards," or, "It's okay to graduate high school as an illiterate," that's 
actually not the facts on the ground.  The standards bear only a passing resemblance to 
what is asked of kids and what actually gets taught.  But that's all kind of a 
distraction.  There's a couple reasons that we should absolutely not embrace the 
Common Core.  First, the Common Core does not solve the problem that it was designed 
to solve.

19:20:24 
 
The motivation behind the launch of the Common Core was what we called the "race to 
the bottom," after No Child Left Behind, the concern that states were playing games 
with their test scores in order to make their schools look better than they 
were.  Common Core was supposed to help address this.  It doesn't.  It doesn't because 
in order to get a lot of states to sign on, partly with the inducement of federal money, 
the advocates for the Common Core brutally compromised the design of the 
thing.  Common Core allows every state to set its own cut score, so every state can 
decide what is or is not passing.  The Smarter Balanced Consortium, one of the two 
federally funded testing consortia, gives states a 12-week testing window.  They can 
decide where in a 12-week period during the spring they would like to test their 
kids.  That means some states can have their kids get 50 percent more learning time 
than other states. 
 
19:21:23 
 
This is a time-tested way to inflate your test scores.  And only about 35 to 40 percent of 
students are actually going to be tested in the spring with the federally funded Common 
Core assessments.  Other states have been bailing in droves, and we've now got a slew 
of states whipping up half-baked assessments for next spring that certainly aren't 
comparable and very likely may be lousier tests than the one they abandoned for the 
Common Core.  So the bottom line is that Common Core actually not only doesn't solve 
the race to the bottom problem, it may actually aggravate it.  Second issue going on 
here is a number of strident claims were made for the Common Core.  We are told that 
the Common Core is evidence based.  We are told that it's internationally benchmarked, 
that it's rigorous.  Well, that evidence is about as disciplined as Mike's reference to the -
- his assertion that every study over 30 years -- just no, you can't make statements like 
this.  
 
19:22:22 
 
There are tens of thousands of studies conducted of United States education, and they 
don't all show anything.  The idea that the Common Core is evidence based?  Look, what 
they mean is the folks sitting on the committees that wrote the Common Core looked at 
some statistics on the kinds of high school courses that college kids take, and they 
looked at some surveys of employers and college professors.  That's fine.  That's 
good.  I'm glad they did that.  That's not evidence of what needs to be or not be in the 
Common Core.  In fact, I'm not sure what kind of evidence one would point to, to prove 
that children need to learn to multiply fractions at this grade rather than that 
grade.  Frankly, these are judgment calls which reasonable people can disagree on.  Lynn 
Fuchs, professor at Vanderbilt, who's got no dog in the Common Core fight, has pointed 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 
  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - 9/10/2014 

out that there's no empirical basis for the Common Core, that we don't know yet 
whether it makes sense to have this particular set of standards or not. 
 
19:23:24 
 
Internationally benchmarked?  What they mean is that people on the committees 
writing the Common Core looked at some international standards, and they copied 
some, and they didn't copy others.  The idea that the Common Core's more 
rigorous?  Well, frankly, the Common Core ends high school math after algebra 2.  Most 
state standards went beyond that.  They included trigonometry and pre-calculus before 
the Common Core.  Now, Mike and Carmel might say that they don't think that stuff's 
necessary or useful, but it's hard for somebody to convince me that these are 
undeniably more rigorous standards when we're jettisoning the last two years of 
mathematics.  Now, this would all be interesting enough and a reason to maybe go slow, 
but there's another piece to the puzzle, which is that Common Core is actually not just 
about words on paper.  It's also about theories of hypotheses about how kids will learn 
better. 
 
19:24:20 
 
These hypotheses are baked into the Common Core, into the tests that have been 
designed to support the Common Core, and they have received shockingly little debate, 
given how radical they are.  One is a fascination with what Common Core advocates 
called close reading.  This is the idea that students ought to learn to read by deciphering 
the text -- preferably nonfiction, by deciphering the text without regard to other 
knowledge and without any personal reaction to the text.  Now, I don't have a problem 
with close reading.  It turns out when I taught high school two decades ago, I actually 
did a fair bit of this.  But the idea that this is how every child at every grade level in 
every subject across an ocean ought to experience reading?  I find that a radical 
proposition.  Common Core embraces something called conceptual math.  You may 
have seen some of the worksheets or the YouTube videos.   
 
19:25:15  
 
This is the stuff that Carol was talking about, the idea that elementary children in 
particular ought to master math by learning the concepts, not just the arithmetic, and 
the best way to master these concepts is by composing and decomposing lots of these 
numbers in various drawing exercises.  I don't have a problem with this as a way to 
teach kids math.  I find it shocking that this should be the way all children of all 
performance levels across the nation ought to learn it.  Third, the Common Core 
embraces something called informational text, informational reading.  At the high 
school level it wants kids to read 70 percent informational text.  It doesn't want to do 
this in English class, which is why we are now looking at children in chemistry classes, for 
instance, reading EPA reports.  The idea that you are going to learn science more

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 - 9/10/2014 

effectively by reading EPA reports than by doing lab is a radical proposition.  In some, 
given that the Common Core doesn't solve the problem, it has been sold based on 
exaggerated claim and calls for major changes of a certain value, it seems to me 
reasonable not to embrace the darn thing.  Thank you. 
 
19:26:22 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Rick Hess.  And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. 
Debate, where our motion is, "Embrace the Common Core."  Remember how you voted 
before the debate.  I want to remind you again that after the debate you'll vote a 
second time and the team whose numbers have changed the most in your estimation in 
percentage point terms will be declared our winner.  Now on to round two.  Round two 
is where the debaters address one another in turn and they take questions from me and 
from you and the audience.  But to remember where we are and where we've been, we 
have two teams against two, Carmel Martin and Mike Petrilli are arguing that you 
embrace the Common Core, thereby they're arguing for the motion.  Their argument's 
saying, "No," they're saying, "The standards are not perfect."  They're saying, "The 
implementation has had problems."  But they say that basically the idea is sound and 
the need is real, that our schools are mediocre, that they're letting down students, not 
allowing them to graduate in ways where they're prepared for college or the or the job 
world.  
 
19:27:22 
 
They say that the testing issue is solvable.  They say it makes no sense to go backwards 
at this point because of the chaos that would result.  And finally they says “The Common 
Core standards are a crucial step forward for American education”.  The team arguing 
against the motion, Carol Burris and Rick Hess arguing that you do not embrace the 
Common Core.  They agree that the standards are not perfect and then some.  Their 
argument is that the standards disregard decades of research on child development, on 
how children learn.  That in the testing, children are being presented with questions of 
such obscurity that it makes them cry.  They say that it’s, when the claim that their 
raising the standard is bogus, when they’re doing things like jettisoning the last two 
years of mathematics.  And they finally come down with this, that there is no evidence 
that the standards actually will lead to improvements in student achievement.  
 
19:28:22 
 
So, I want to look at a lot of this and slice it up.  But there’s one point that I want to get 
to early in this.  Given that a lot of the controversy about this debate has been of a 
political nature, I heard the opposition make an argument based on substance, which I

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - 9/10/2014 

welcome.  Nevertheless, it’s a very political hot potato with the accusation being made 
that the Common Core was designed in secret by a small cabal of people directed by Bill 
Gates and by the Obama Administration.   Your opponent Carmel Martin, who to some 
degree was defending against this.  You didn’t make that argument at all.  I just want to 
know, do you concede her point?  Do you take the point that it was a state thing and on 
the charges that this is a top down Obama Administration program is one that you 
concede to that side? 
 
Carol Burris: 
I would say yes and no.  You know, certainly they weren’t conceived in secret, but they 
were conceived by a very, very small group of people who were predominantly non-
educators. 
 
19:29:23 
 
And the input happened after the fact.   Certainly as an educator, I had really no 
awareness of any of this going on and I stay very current.  Until 2010, and then 
everything was presented in one fell swoop.  Certainly the president has made it very 
clear that he is supportive of the Common Core standards but mostly what happened 
was Race to the Top.  And that was a federal program.  And if you look at some of the 
writings and went back to 2008, as the Governors Association were talking about this, 
they were actually saying these are the kinds of incentives that we need. 
 
John Donvan: 
Carol, remind people what race to the top was. 
 
Carol Burris: 
Right, Race to the Top was a stimulus program that came into effect shortly after 
President Obama was elected president.  The whole idea behind Race to the Top was 
that there were going to have to be radical changes in schools, adoption of Common 
Core standards or something similar., testing programs, evaluation of teachers by test 
scores, and other things. 
 
19:30:27 
 
And in order to get the money and we all desperately needed the money, states very, 
very quickly put together applications. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, let me take that to your opponent.  I guess we will touch somewhat on the politics 
of this.  I’m going to take this back to Carmel Martin between you responded to this in 
your opening statement.  We’re hearing Carol Burris saying that de facto, the fact that 
the administration offered prizes, financial prizes to schools, partly for adopting

  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - 9/10/2014 

common standards, does suggest that that this was a federally steered, to some degree 
federally steered effort. 
 
Carmel Martin: 
Well, I would say again, this was an effort that was underway before President Obama 
was President Obama.  It was led by a democratic and republican governor from very 
diverse states.  They had the support of virtually again, Sarah Palin and Rick Perry don’t 
support much, but the other 48 governors were strongly supportive of it. 
 
19:31:23 
 
And the Obama administration supported an initiative that was state led, that was 
driven from, I would argue, bottom up, not top down.  And I think what we need to keep 
in mind though, is even if--we’ll never know how many states would have adopted the 
standards but for the incentives provided by the federal government.  But then the 
question before us right now is, given that it was something that was developed, 
through I would argue, contrary to Carol, through a very rigorous process.  It brought 
teachers into the process.  It brought the public into the process.  And then once each 
state adopted it, there was process at the state level around the standards.  So, then the 
question before us is, are the standards good for our students?  And Mike and I think it 
is. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, and we will come to that question.  I want to see if we want to do one more 
round on the political issue.  Rick Hess, if you want to respond to what Carmel said. 
 
19:32:16 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
Yes, I think first off, Carmel is playing, her characterization of the timeline is I think loose 
-- what the governors supported in 2008 was the exploration of the idea of making 
some standards more common. I think most folks, in 2009, 2010, imagine there were 
maybe a dozen or 15 states that were, themselves, ready, unprovoked, to move forward 
and explore the Common Core. In fact, Mike, I'd like to hear your take, because you, for 
instance, have said that the federal government has been heavy-handed with Common 
Core and deserves to be chastened. In fact, you have encouraged Oklahoma governor 
Mary Fallin to sue -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Rick Hess --

-- the Secretary of Education.

John Donvan: 
I just want to remind you to pull your papers under the mic, because -- 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
I'm sorry. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- we lose you a little bit when you turn away -- 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
My apologies. 
 
John Donvan: 
Why don't you -- why don't you rephrase the question again, just so the radio audience 
gets to hear it? 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
Sure. No. Absolutely. My apologies for that. Mike, I'm curious on your response to 
Carmel, given that you have previously testified to the Indiana State Senate that the 
federal government has been heavy-handed with this reform and deserves to be 
chastened. 
 
19:33:16 
 
And that you have, in fact, said that you hope the Oklahoma Governor, Mary Fallin, sues 
the U.S. Secretary of Education because not through race to the top, but through 
waivers from No Child Left Behind -- you said, "Nothing gives a secretary of education 
the authority to push states around when it comes to those standards." 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. Mike, you got to hear the question twice. Extra time to think about it. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
I did. Yes.  
 
[laughter]  
 
And it had a question mark at the end. That was good. Yes. Absolutely. And if we were 
here to debate the federal role in education, I would move over there. Maybe Carol 
would be over here. I'm not sure. But we are here to debate --

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - 9/10/2014 

Michael Petrilli: 
-- to debate the Common Core, right? It is true. Look, the -- I think everybody is in 
agreement. I wrote an article recently with a strong opponent of the Common Core. We 
wrote together. Here are the facts. It started out as a state-led initiative. And then the 
Obama Administration came in and endorsed it. There's no doubt that it had a big 
impact in the number of states that got involved. And in my opinion, we would all be 
much better off if the federal government would now butt out. So, Carmel, maybe you 
can share that view with the Secretary of Education.  
 
19:34:19 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. Let's move on. Let's stipulate that this side feels that this was not top-down, 
that it was -- it started with the states. This side feels it's murkier than that. I want to 
move on now to the substance of the arguments that were made. And I want to take to 
this side the very strong charge made by your opponent, Carol Burris -- I want to take it 
to the side arguing to embrace the Common Core. Carol Burris's statement that there is 
no evidence that these standards actually will result in achievement. What's the 
evidence -- 
 
Carmel Martin: 
Well, I would say -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Carmel Martin. 
 
Carmel Martin: 
-- it's early to judge the implementation of the standards. 
 
John Donvan: 
But that's not the question. The question is, where is the evidence -- 
 
Carmel Martin: 
I understand that. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- supporting them? 
 
Carmel Martin: 
I would -- but I would say, although it's early, we do see some signs of success. And I 
would point to Kentucky, which was one of the first states to adopt the Common Core. 
And in --

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - 9/10/2014 

 
John Donvan: 
Carmel, can I stop you? Only because of time limits, that I think the sense of the 
question is that when they were put together, prior to their implementation, that there 
was no evidence that they were -- they were based on no evidence that they would 
work, as opposed to how they've done -- 
 
Carmel Martin: 
Well -- 
 
John Donvan: 
-- since then. I think -- 
 
Carmel Martin: 
Okay. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- that was your point? 
 
Female Speaker: 
Yes. 
John Donvan: 
Yep. Okay. 
 
Carmel Martin: 
Well, I mean, I think that's just factually inaccurate. 
 
19:35:20 
 
I think that the folks who got together to draft the new standards relied very heavily on 
the existing research that they had about what children needed to be able to do and 
what set of knowledge they needed to have to be successful in college and in good jobs. 
They brought in the people from the post-secondary sector, something that hadn't been 
done in K-12 education historically, which really is pretty illogical that that hadn't been 
done before. They brought in people from the business community to talk about what 
skills they needed their employees to have. They brought in content experts. They 
showed the standards to the associations that represent teachers in mathematics and 
English language arts. And they took in their input. I think neither Mike nor I would say 
that each and every standard is perfect. But I think if you look at the process that was 
used in the development of these standards and compare -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.

Carmel Martin: 
-- it to the process that was used under the old standards by most states, that it was 
very rigorous, and they did look at evidence. And you can -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Carmel Martin: 
-- disagree, but they did look at evidence. 
 
19:36:23 
 
John Donvan: 
Carol Burris, have you been refuted on this point? 
 
Carol Burris: 
No. I -- the truth of the matter is, one of the things that's very different about the 
Common Core that I spoke about, is unlike the old Massachusetts standards, the 
standards in New York -- which really just identify what kids should know at grade levels 
-- the Common Core standards create -- or contain what's called instructional shifts in 
practice. Six in ELA and six in [unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
ELA? 
 
Carol Burris: 
English language arts. Thank you. For example, the whole idea that it makes sense for 
young children to engage in close reading -- there is absolutely no evidence that that's 
the case. At the high school level, yes. But not at the elementary level. There was no real 
research that was based on yanking up lexile levels. We know from years of 
developmental reading research that kids do best when they read independently with 
leveled readers. But the Common Core says no. The Common Core says predominant 
reading should be on what is considered to be grade level, which has just been 
increased.  
 
19:37:27 
 
And if the kids don't get it, well, the teachers should read it aloud.  Well, let me tell you 
something.  You learned how to ride your bicycle by riding your bicycle.  You didn't learn 
how to ride your bicycle by having your dad never taking his hands off the bar. 
 
John Donvan: 
Mike -- let's let Mike Petrilli respond. 
 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 
  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - 9/10/2014 

Michael Petrilli: 
Yeah, and I'm so glad that you raised this, a couple times, this idea of close reading.  And 
I spent the big part of the weekend talking to some reading experts getting ready for 
this question, and I think I have a better understanding.  It's going to get a little weedy, 
but I'll get through it very fast.  And it's this.  We've had a system for years where we've 
said, "Okay, if a child can only read at the first-grade level and they're in fifth grade, 
we're going to give them first-grade level books, right, with the hope that over time they 
would get better.  The problem is there's five or six rigorous studies showing by and 
large those kids were never getting better at reading. 
 
19:38:14 
 
And that they're -- what the studies showed is what you really need to do is find ways to 
get the kids to read more challenging texts at their grade level, which means at first -- 
and the teachers today helped explain this so, so much better than I could -- that the 
teachers start by reading it aloud, having the kids follow along.  They do what they call, 
"scaffolding," over time.  And over time, they start to teach the kids how to do this 
reading so that they can let go of the handlebar and they can ride the bike on their 
own.  And kids who are way behind grade level, including kids who are special education 
students, are never going to make progress if we don't challenge them with those grade 
level texts.  This is what the evidence says, and the Common Core looks at the evidence.

Mike, I hate to step on the applause line, but actually I think you conflated two 
things.  You conflated close reading and Lexile.  These are not the same thing. 
 
John Donvan: 
What's a Lexile? 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
A lexile is gauging how complicated a piece of reading is -- a piece of literature.  Look, 
close reading is a particular theory of how kids should read.

David Coleman, president of the college board, the lead writer on the English Language 
Arts Standard, liked to talk about close reading as teaching kids to read like a detective 
and write like a journalist.  Frankly, I think that sounds perfectly fine as one piece of how 
we teach children to read.  I don't think that I'm a particular fan of the idea that every 
child in America from grades K to 12 ought to learn to write like a journalist. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Right, but Rick, is that actually in the standards?  Do the standards say that?  No.  What 
the standards say is that children need to read at grade level proficiently. 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
Well, Mike, wait [laughs] a minute.  This is, I think, the degree of ambiguity in the 
Common Core that drives a lot of people crazy, that at one level the Common Core is 
just a bunch of innocuous words on paper, you know, one of the eighth grade reading 
standards, "Compare and contrast the structure of two or more texts and analyze how 
the deferring structure of each text contributes to its meaning and style."  This isn't very 
different from what most states previously had. 
 
19:40:22 
 
These are a bunch of pleasant words on paper.  I have no particular objection to them. 
The significance of the Common Core is that the advocates for the Common Core and 
the people who are designing the test talk very explicitly about, as Carol said, these 
instructional shifts, which have not been publicly debated, which got little public airing 
as 40-odd states rushed to adopt the Common Core in 2009, 2010, and which portend a 
dramatic shift in how we teach 50 million children reading and math. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
I'm not sure these are bad things, but I sure as heck think we ought to find out more 
before we embrace them. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
But when there is evidence -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Mike Petrilli. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
-- as we have now in early reading -- there was evidence 20 years ago on phonics -- on 
phonemic awareness, that was finally incorporated into our schools -- now we have 
good evidence that these level texts, just having kids who are fifth graders reading first

grade texts over and over again, has not been working.  Now we have that evidence.  It's 
time to follow the evidence.  And that's what Common Core does.  Not every point has 
that, but where there is evidence -- we know that calculator use in the first grade, not a 
good idea.  
 
19:41:25 
 
The Common Cores says we should not be using calculators till the kids get older.  These 
are dramatically more evidence based than the standards that came before. 
 
John Donvan: 
Hang on one second.  Carol Burris. 
 
Carol Burris: 
Yeah.  I think it's really easy for you to say, Mike, "Well, this is what the evidence 
shows."  I guess what I'm going to say to you is, "Show me the evidence," because what I 
-- 
[applause] 
 
-- Common Core is wrong about literacy in many ways, okay?  [Unintelligible] in 2013 
has pointed out test complexity is based on the erroneous notion that we must ramp up 
test difficulty beginning in third grade in order to achieve college and career 
readiness.  Kylene Beers and Robert Probst-- these are university professors in reading, 
their excellent book, Notice and Note, worries that text dependent questions in close 
reading will lead to student disengagement in reading.  Piano, 2013, has shown that the 
elimination of work-play stations may harm the development of oral language so vital 
for these learners.  
 
19:42:22 
 
These are all people in the research community and in schools  saying, "This does not 
work."  I have never -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, Carol, let -- 
 
Carol Burris: 
-- seen the evidence that level checks do not work. 
 
John Donvan: 
That's exactly the question I wanted to take to Mike.  Your response to this

Yeah, yeah, no.  Well, I will be happy to go find it for you after this debate. 
 
[laughter] 
 
I don't have it with me.  But, look, here's the question -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But you're confident that it exists? 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
I -- no, I'm absolutely confident.  Look, this has been the dominant way we have taught 
reading now for decades.  And you look at our achievement in reading, and it is mostly 
flat.  And you look at our achievement in reading for special education kids, for kids who 
are behind, and what you find is that they are not making progress fast enough.  We've 
done better in math where we've made greater progress, particularly for poor kids, but 
in reading it's been slow.  We've made some progress in teaching early reading because 
of phonics and phonemic awareness because there we finally followed the evidence. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
And what I'm saying is that we need to follow the evidence.  The Common Core is saying 
that's what we need to do, follow the evidence.  Kids deserve to be challenged. 
 
19:43:21 
 
The teachers I talk to today, you know --

-- I mean, Carol's argument earlier -- the four words, "These are too hard," right? 
John Donvan: 
All right, let me -- Mike, let me -- I want to move on to -- in terms of evidence, earlier 
when the question of evidence came up, Carmel Martin, you started talking about the 
evidence so far in places where it has been implemented, how it's doing, and I cut you 
off because we weren't at that point. 
 
Carmel Martin: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
I want to hear now, what's the evidence that it's working in places where it's in place?

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - 9/10/2014 

Carmel Martin: 
Well, first, I just want to finish Mike's thought there.  I mean, when we talked to 
teachers today, they acknowledge that when the standards were first brought to their 
schools, they were concerned that they would be too hard for their children, but we 
heard things like reports that teachers said, "Wow, I didn't think they'd be able to do it 
and they are," and talk about the joy that they've had in seeing their children meet that 
challenge.  And I have to say, as a former civil rights attorney, it just makes me very 
nervous when people talk about how, you know, you need to -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Carmel Martin: 
-- some kids can't reach the same expectations as other kids. 
 
19:44:19 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, all right. 
 
Carol Burris: 
Can I jump in? 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah, I want to let Carol Burris respond. 
 
[applause] 
 
Carol Burris: 
I am the last person on the planet that would ever say, "Some kids can't."  I run an 
integrated high school, 16 percent of our kids are on free or reduced price lunch, and 
every one of them tomorrow who are 12th graders will walk into an international 
baccalaureate English class.  So, that's -- this is not about it being hard, it's about it being 
wrong.  That's what it's about.  It's about it being appropriate.

John Donvan: 
Carmel, do you want to respond to that point before we move on? 
 
Carmel Martin: 
Yeah.

Carmel Martin: 
Yeah, like I said earlier the point -- the example that Carol made about being able to 
count to one -- to 100 in ones and tens, I know lots of five-year olds who can do 
that.  And I think that if we ask children coming from all different backgrounds to be 
able to do that, they'll be able to do that.  
 
19:45:18 
 
And, you know, I think that we have lots of evidence that we're -- what we're asking 
them to do under the old standards wasn't working, that -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me -- let me bring a question to your opponents because it's something about your 
opening statements that I either didn't understand or confused me.  It sounded -- I felt I 
was hearing a mixed message.  I was hearing from you, Carol, "These standards are too 
high," for kids in kindergarten.  And I was hearing from Rick, "These standards are too 
low," and I'm not sure which way you're going on this. 
 
[applause] 
 
Rick, do you want to take it, or Carol? 
 
Carol Burris: 
I'd be happy to take it.  It's not a matter of too high or too low, it's a matter of silly and 
not right.  For example, in the early grades, there are a lot of standards that are not 
developmentally appropriate, but then when you go up to the high school level, which 
Rick was talking about -- I mean, I was talking with my math teachers today.  
 
19:46:19 
 
We have to implement Common Core geometry.  Well, what does it do?  It's a whole 
different course in geometry based on constructions.  Well, it worked out really well for 
the early Greeks, but it is not an effective strategy today.  We actually tried it in our 
school a couple years ago in anticipation of the Common Core, and the kids were 
lost.  Trigonometry has been stripped out of the algebra 2 class.  Since I went to school 
back in, I hate to admit it, the 1960s, trigonometry was part of the course of studies in 
high school.  Common Core has changed it.  It's not algebra 2.  So the problems that you 
hear is not, "It's too hard," or, "It's too soft," it's just not right at a variety of levels. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, and I want to take -- I want to move to that -- and so your point being it's wonky 
in many ways?

[applause] 
 
Carol Burris: 
Yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Fair enough.  It can be wonky in many ways, and your point would hold up.  I want to 
take to Mike Petrilli because you were talking in your opening statement about the 
nature of testing. 
 
19:47:21 
 
And you were saying that there's -- "I sense a technology of testing that's better than it 
used to be." 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Right. 
 
John Donvan: 
Testing is one of the things that parents are most upset about.  Not only are they 
confused about the work that they’re doing, they’re very, very upset about the testing 
processes.  What is your response to those parents? 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Right, is that their concerns are very well founded, as are the concerns of many 
educators who have been complaining for years, decades now, that the tests we’ve 
been using to judge schools are not well designed.  And they’re right.  Those tests by 
and large have been very inexpensive tests.  They’ve been set at a low level.  They’ve 
been fill in the blank.  And now we finally have this opportunity to move to much better 
tests with the Common Core, that are under development, that are coming this spring 
for the very first time in about half of the country.  And this is our opportunity to now 
address many of those concerns.  And for example, these tests will have a lot more 
writing on them than most of the other tests had.  It’s very hard to test kids’ critical 
thinking skills if it’s just multiple choice.  Right, certainly hard to test their writing skills.  
 
19:48:20 
 
Yet a state like Georgia has been trying to get by with a test that costs eight dollars per 
kid and therefore doesn’t have any writing on it.  And what we’re trying to do here is to 
turn that page.  And say look, there were major problems with the test under the No 
Child Left Behind era.  We’ve heard those concerns and now we’re trying to get 
something better, something that I think that Carol and Rick have supported in the past.

I’d appreciate it if Rick, if you want to step in, because we haven’t heard from you in a 
bit.  And you look like you’re steaming over there. 
 
[laughter] 
 
If you want to defer to your partner, please do. 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
No, I always look that way.  Two thoughts, one on testing and one just on the prior 
question.  One, you know John, one way to think about this is it’s really we’re debating 
embrace the Common Core.  Again I’m not declaring the Common Core to be atrocious 
or malicious.  I am suggesting that the standard of proof for the Common Core is much 
higher than for old state standards.  Massachusetts had had state standards in place for 
18 years, give or take.  
 
19:49:20 
 
Those standards had produced substantial and sustained improvements in student 
learning.  If what Mike and Carmel had been advocating for, was taking these standards 
whose tires we’ve kicked for 15 or more years, and taking those national, I would have 
been very open to that.  The idea that we have a bunch of design hypotheses about 
what kids should know, we think, maybe, and how they should learn it, maybe.   The 
idea that we want to roll this out for 50 million children with little opportunity to see 
how this plays out or what it means, leaves me remarkably nervous.  So for me -- 
 
[applause] 
 
So, for me it’s less about too high or too low.  I think frankly we just don’t know.  On the 
testing point, I mean, like I said at the beginning, I’m with Mike.  I’m for good tests.  I’m 
anti-bad tests.  Mike and I are on the same page here. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But I think the notion that the Common Core tests are good is an open question. 
 
19:50:17 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay I want to remind you that we are in a question and answer section of this 
Intelligence squared US debate.  I’m John Donvan your moderator and we have four

you stand up, a mic will find you.  Coming, it’s coming from your right hand side.  So 
really nice, tight, do me proud, good question. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Hi, My name is Nareda [spelled phonetically] and I’m not a teacher or an educator.  I’m 
actually Janelle.  I went to Smith College and then later to Oxford University and my first 
year at Smith was tough.  So my question is about the next generation learning tests.  
How do or do not, how do they measure critical thinking skills, with the caveat that PISA, 
the countries that score the highest in PISA are using multiple choice straight answer 
tests? 
 
19:51:17 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me ask you if you could rephrase your question in a way that lets him convince you 
to embrace the Common Core.  So, are you saying are these next generation tests the 
key, the secret, are they going to save it? 
 
Female Speaker: 
I want to know more about them.  Exactly, we want next generation exams that are no 
longer simple to answer.  But how do they actually, what role do they play in actually 
measuring critical thinking skills and developing them so that we have a standard? 
 
John Donvan: 
Can I rephrase your question to be-- 
 
Female Speaker: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
Tell us why these next generation tests are working and why therefore we should  
embrace the Common Core.

Carmel Martin: 
I would say the Common Core standards very much drive towards teaching and 
assessment that is focused on creating problem solvers and good communicators, those 
kinds of skills.  And we heard just today from a group of teachers that we talked to, that 
under the new assessments, they can’t teach to the tests anymore, because the tests 
are no longer about rote memorization. 
 
19:52:20 
 
It’s about children being able to make inferences and digest the texts, so I think it goes 
exactly to the point that you mentioned.  The crafters of the Common Core did look at 
at PISA. They also looked at Massachusetts and they did borrow from places where they 
thought it was working, as well as looking into the evidence, so I think it really tackles 
the issue that you're talking about very effectively. And I think assessments aligned to 
those kinds of standards should really help us move away from a mode of rote 
memorization towards teaching in an enriched way. 
 
John Donvan: 
Carol Burris. 
 
Carol Burris: 
I think it's always helpful to have an example. Here's what's called the Research 
Simulation Task. The Research Simulation Task -- this is from PARCC -- is an assessment 
component worthy of student preparation because it asks students to exercise the 
career and college readiness skills of observation, deduction, and proper use and 
evaluation of evidence across text types. 
 
19:53:17 
 
In this test, students will analyze an informational topic presented through several 
articles, multimedia stimuli, the first text being an anchor text. Students will engage 
with the text by answering a series of questions and synthesizing information from 
multiple sources in order to write two analytic essays. I think that sounds great. Grade 3. 
That was Grade 3. You know what? If kids can do that at the end of Grade 3, I can retire. 
Just give them calculus in fourth grade and send all those Doogie Howsers off to college.

of the most critical issues in our nation is -- is talent development.  
 
19:54:15

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - 9/10/2014 

Sure. I would say there have been analysis comparing the Common Core to the high-
achieving states, like Massachusetts, and shown that they are comparable and higher in 
some respects. So, I -- and I think if you look at -- talk to the folks in Massachusetts -- 
just as an example -- they feel like the Common Core is helping them to serve all their 
students -- because they're focused on development as skills, again, and not just rote 
memorization and test preparation, that it's helping -- we heard this today as well, but 
it's helping children across the spectrum in terms of where they start.  
 
19:55:23  
 
I started saying earlier, Kentucky is one of the first states to implement the Common 
Core. In just one year, their high school graduates ready for college and career jumped 
from 34 percent to 47 percent. And that's still not good enough, but that shows clear 
progress.  
 
[applause]  
 
You -- also in New York, this year, again, slow progress, but since implementation of the 
Common Core, there has been increase in performance. And the best increase has been 
among minority populations. Three to four percentage points for African American and 
Hispanic students here in New York. 
 
John Donvan: 
Rick has a response. 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
Sure. I mean, one, Carmel -- I mean, I think this point about Massachusetts, if I recall 
right, Mike, for instance, has argued that the Massachusetts standards were better -- or 
at least as good as the Common Core. So, yet -- I think let's be careful about imputing 
claims to the Common Core. Even folks who support them, I think, tend to be more 
measured about how good they think they are.  
 
19:56:17  
 
Second, the Kentucky point -- the fact that you've got more kids scoring proficient 
doesn't mean anything whatsoever. You can adjust a cut score in any direction you 
want. This has always been the concern with post-No Child Left Behind testing. So, the 
fact that Kentucky scores went up doesn't tell us a thing unless we know how Kentucky 
is setting the score and [inaudible] -- 
 
John Donvan: 
By -- [unintelligible] this and by cut score, you mean make -- the score at which you 
make the cut to pass or fail?

their hands in the back, I've got to -- or upstairs, I can't see you, so I just want to ask you 
to come down a few steps please. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Sure. So I understand this -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Can you tell us your name, please? 
 
Female Speaker: 
Oh. Effie Fisch [spelled phonetically]. I understand the side arguing against -- has posed 
a lot of criticisms on the Common Core tests. But I want to go back to something that 
you had said in your opening remarks, about if we accepted that position, what would 
we be accepting in its place? Is it a national test based on the Massachusetts standard? 
Is it going back to different state standards? Would we just be kind of waiting and 
hoping something came along better? 
 
19:57:18

So, you know, my response would be, "Look" I think not embracing the Common Core 
says that if there are states where parents and educators and policymakers are 
sufficiently enthused about the work -- I think there's eight or 12 or 15 of these -- I think 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 - 9/10/2014 

they should proceed.  And they can go down that road, and we can see how well it 
works and see what the results are.  I think in other states we should absolutely, as Mike 
suggested, get the federal government the heck out of this question through No Child 
Left Behind waivers or anything else.  We should feel comfortable with states either 
choosing to revert to the standards they had in place, highly regarded previous 
standards like Massachusetts', D.C.'s, Indiana's, or California's, because, remember, 
nobody hit the delete button on those old standards, on the curricula that matched, or 
on those assessments.   
 
19:58:17  
 
I think it makes sense, before one does a dramatic and bold remaking of 50 -- of the 
schools serving 50 million kids, that we actually move deliberately and carefully for once 
and see how this works and what unanticipated changes lurk. 
 
John Donvan:

Well, you know, I know Rick spends a lot of his time writing books in a cave

Let him go on, and then I'll come back to you. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
You know, there are enormous, enormous costs, financial, morale issues.  You know, 
teachers have put their heart and soul into teaching these standards -- I mean, we heard 
from some of these teachers today -- for four years.  So let's be clear that this is not now 
a hypothetical argument, "Should we move forward?  Should we adopt the Common 
Core?"  Schools have adopted it.  They're moving forward.  And so now the question is, 
"Should we go back and undo all the work of the last four years?"

And you've held this very high bar, both you and Carol today, that basically the Common 
Core have to be remarkable in order to go ahead.  So if you're going to go back to those

evidence that we should move to those lower standards?  Why aren't you having a high

John Donvan: 
Carol Burris. 
 
Carol Burris: 
-- I find to be a very frightening argument.  I -- you know, I don't live in the world of 
talking points where I have to worry about changing my mind.  I live in the world of kids, 
and I see what the Common Core standards are doing to kids.  I hear my teachers come 
in.  I don't know what group of teachers you're talking to, but they're very different than 
the ones that I work with every day who come in, showing me bizarre worksheets, who 
tell me their children don't want to go to school anymore, that they hate school, that 
they want to be able to read interesting books instead of technical manuals.  
 
20:00:26  
 
You know, we're really resilient smart people, teachers.  Please don't think that we 
could not adjust.  I've lived through four sets of standards since I've been in 
education.  We can do it.  We can do the work.  We need the federal government to 
back off, and we need to have dialogues within our states where we take -- maybe we 
start with the Common Core.  We clean up what's a mess, and we make them actually 
better.  You know, there is something about competition that is not a bad thing.  If we 
are all doing the same thing in every state and doing it the same way, where will the 
new ideas come from?  I really see the changes in my high school.

This matter of -- this matter of going back at this point reminds me as I was reading on 
this, one Republican governor who was very enthusiastic about this.

I want to remind you we're in the question and answer section of this Intelligence 
Squared U.S. Debate.  I'm John Donvan, your moderator.  We have four debaters, two 
teams of two, debating this motion, "Embrace the Common Core."  Let's go back to 
audience questions.  Anybody farther up who I'm not seeing?  Sir, right there.  If you 
look to your left, he's coming that way.  If you could tell us your name again, please. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Hi, my name's Trevor.  I went into a private school where we didn't have a lot of testing. 
And I found out my motivations for learning were genuine and a little more self-
motivated, so the nature of just testing itself, I want to know numbers, quantitatively 
how much testing is there in the Common Core to be expected, and also what do you 
think that those specifically for the morale and -- of the students and also the teachers? 
 
John Donvan: 
Carmel Martin. 
 
20:02:20 
 
Carmel Martin: 
Well, I don't have the exact numbers in terms of how much time will be spent testing, 
but it is my hope that under these new better fairer fewer assessments under the 
Common Core that we can eliminate a lot of the testing that happens around the 
country under the old set of standards and assessments, what we see across the country 
is districts layering on additional assessments on top.  And I think as we move towards 
these better assessments under the Common Core that we can eliminate unnecessary 
testing.  I think testing is a tough issue.  It's something -- my kids hate it, and I have to 
explain to them why they have to do it and how it provides really valuable information 
to their teachers about how they're doing so they can help them to do better, just like 
when I bring my child to the doctor and they say, "I really don't want to get that shot,"

sometimes you have to do things that aren't very pleasant.  I think what's important is 
to make sure that in creating a culture around testing, we're not making children 
stressed out, we're not making them cry over the tests.  And I think that part of that is 
professional development, the environment in the school around the tests. 
 
20:03:24 
 
[applause] 
 
We heard that -- we heard that from some teachers we talked to today about how that's 
-- and that takes a lot of leadership in the school to make sure that it is being used as a 
tool to get better.  I think Carol has made a lot of good points about the way 
assessments are being used, that we really should take a closer look at that --they do 
help create a negative culture around testing.  But again, that's about how the tests are 
used, not what the standards should be and whether you should have the assessments 
so you can learn from them and improve practice. 
 
John Donvan: 
Carol Burris. 
 
Carol Burris: 
Yeah, in New York State, testing was increasing anyway, but under the Common Core it's 
gotten worse.  You're talking about increases of 200 percent, for example, at some of 
the grade levels.  You're talking about three days of ELA testing, three days of math 
testing, and a lot of it is really because of not only the Common Core itself, but also the 
policies that were also part of the Department of Education that Carmel worked for.  
 
20:04:25  
 
So, that teachers now are evaluated by test scores which then added a lot of other 
additional tests.  All of these things have come together at once, and kids are 
crying.  I've had colleagues who -- they've had kids who've wet their pants.  You know, 
kids want to do well on tests.  They want to please their teachers.  They want to please 
their parents.  And when they find themselves reading and rereading paragraphs in 
order to do close readings and flipping back and forth, some of them really just start to 
give up.  You know, in New York, we had 60,000 kids opt out of testing last year. 
 
[applause] 
 
We never had that.  We never had that before. 
 
John Donvan: 
Another question.  I'm just trying to look farther up in the back.  Right up against the 
wall there.

Female Speaker: 
Hi, good evening.  My name is Pamela.  
 
20:05:23 
 
 I'm a New York City Department of Education teacher.  I've been teaching since the late 
'70s. 
 
[applause] 
 
You know, through all of our professional development and graduate programs, we're 
always talking about differentiated instruction and how important this is for our special 
needs students, ELA students, ESL students, regular ed students.  Everybody learns 
differently.  We all know this.  There's been a hierarchy of learning for all those years. 
My question is how does adhering to the Common Core advance the progress of 
teaching with differentiated instruction to support the way that students learn and the 
way that they test because, as you said, not all students test well. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, you actually had a question mark, and I'm going to land it there. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Yes, I did.

Michael Petrilli: 
Thank you.  That's a great question.  You know, this is key.  And we've had these debates 
for a long time.  Just to say that, you know, standards does not have to equal 
standardization, right?  We want to make sure that our education system is linked to 
success for what comes next, and that means that if we're measuring student progress, 
this should be against the real world and what they're going to have.  But that does not 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 
  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 - 9/10/2014 

mean that we have a standard way of getting there.  Different schools have different 
approaches, different teachers have different approaches, and different kids are going 
to learn different ways, and that's all absolutely appropriate.  What we don't want to 
have is a system that has standards that are set so low that we're giving the false 
impression that kids are doing fine when they're not.  And, you know, Carol, I know you 
keep saying, "Well, it's not too high, it's not too low, it's just wrong."  Go back to those 
old systems, okay?  Colorado, before they adopted the Common Core, for example, you 
could score at the 10th percentile in reading in Colorado and be considered proficient, 
okay?  So you would get a report as a parent that your child is proficient.  That's great. 
 
20:07:21 
 
Okay, what you didn't know was that, that meant that 90 percent of the kids at that 
same grade level nationwide were reading better than you were.  That meant that you 
weren't ever even close to being on grade level.  That is the system that we had, and 
that is the system that state states that are thinking about pulling out the Common 
Core, which is mostly in these red states, with big Tea Party influence.  That is what they 
are going back, that’s what this is about, that’s why we need to keep moving forward. 
 
John Donvan: 
Rick Hess. 
 
[applause] 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
So Mike, first that’s not an accurate characterization of what it means to be a Common 
Core state.  As you well know, lots of Common Core states are making up their own 
tests.  They are choosing their own cut score.  Nothing of significance has changed from 
under NCLB.  So imputing this great virtue.  Secondly these statistical gains can be 
played both ways.  James Milgram, Professor Emeritus at Stanford, one of the five 
members of the Common Core validation committee who refused to sign off on the 
quality of the Common Core, has pointed out that if you look at federal data for 
instance.  
 
20:08:27 
 
That students who only go through Algebra II, only 40 percent of them ever complete a 
four year college degree.  Whereas 75 percent of students who take pre-calculus, which 
those old Colorado standards had, go on to complete a college degree.  So, I guess if 
we’re going to argue about these implications, one question is, why truncate it if this 
data seems to suggest that the Common Core is going to have fewer children ready to 
complete their educations?

Mike Petrilli. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Right so, let’s go back to the question about testing.  Rick is right, that there are a 
number of states out there, that because of political pressure, mostly from the political 
right, have decided to pull back from the Common Core testing.  Right, it’s because 
that’s the position you are arguing.  Your position is being heard in red states and they 
are saying, therefore we’re not going to do these better tests.  We’re going to do our 
own tests.  Because we don’t want anything involved with the federal government.  
 
20:09:22 
 
We’re afraid of all kinds of other issues.  My argument is that those states have not 
embraced the Common Core. They have not fully embraced the Common Core.  Because 
you cannot embrace higher standards if you don’t also embrace better assessments. 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
But Mike, embracing the Common Core. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
They go together. 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
Embracing the Common Core, does embracing the Common Core mean embracing a 
national cut score? 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
It means embracing a rigorous standard . 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
No, no, no.  Does it mean embracing a national, because otherwise, states can use a 
Common Core tests, which are still very much of unproven quality, as I think you’ve 
publicly conceded.  We don’t know if they’re good tests or not.  But you can use those 
tests and still make up your own cut score, and still [unintelligible] three extra months of 
instruction.  So the idea that you are now getting honest clear apples to apples 
comparisons because you have used, it is just simply.

What I think I’m hearing Rick, is that you agree with our position, that we should 
embrace the Common Core, embrace good assessment and make sure that the states 
are [unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, no, no, no, no. 
 
20:10:21 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
No, he actually asked a really good specific question.  Which is, if the Common Core is 
embraced from California to Maine to Florida, to Alabama to Montana, does the kid in 
Montana have to get the same score, to get, on the same test, to get past through the 
high school, as the kid in Alabama? 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Right.  I would prefer that kind of policy.  And it looks like the states that are doing the 
PARCC test, as far as we can tell, are going to agree to a common cut score.  We’re not 
sure yet about Smarter Balance.  I think even those other states, even those that don’t 
have great tests, all signs are, even those are going to have much more challenging cut 
scores than they had before.  So we will have made some progress on these issues.  But 
look, Rick, I would love- 
 
John Donvan: 
That’s a yes. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
That is a yes. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay, you got a yes on that.  Are you surprised by that?  Now where do you go? 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
I mean I think, frankly, I think this is part of it.  I think not embracing the Common Core 
is to say look, a number of states should do the Common Core and they should do it 
uncompromisingly and aggressively.  And we should see if their children actually benefit.

You know, I wrote a book, in my Harvard dissertation, close to 20 years ago, called

at stake, that we excitedly tout a new thing, an exciting thing, No Child Left Behind, or 
reading verse, or comprehensive school reform.  We have to rush it out, into lots of

I have a quick question. 
 
20:12:25 
 
I’m the mother of a special needs child.  I am also a teacher of English language learners. 
But my question is, are these standards copyrighted?  And as a result of that, can 
teachers veer off the script? That's my question. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's take it to Carmel Martin. 
 
Carmel Martin: 

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 
  Arlington, VA 22203 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 - 9/10/2014 

Yeah. They are not copyrighted. They're open. And teachers -- I think where we see 
Common Core being implemented effectively, teachers aren't following a script. What 
we see is that the -- as I said in my opening, the standards create guide posts, a 
destination. And teachers are able to then construct lessons so they can differentiate for 
the children in their class. We have heard very positive things from teachers of special 
ed students, that in some ways, they're better than the old way because it allows you to 
get the answer through different methodologies -- and math, for example, it's -- allows 
for different ways to get to the answer. 
 
20:13:28 
 
So, I would say that they should not feel scripted. I do think, in some places, with that -- 
with those bad instructional leadership, they're being given scripts and told to follow the 
script. But I don't think that's the right way to implement the standards. And I don't 
think the standards themselves dictate that. I think the standards really try to shift in the 
direction of giving teachers more freedom, like the teacher that I quoted in my opening 
had mentioned. 
 
John Donvan: 
Carol Burris. 
 
Carol Burris: 
The Common Core standards most certainly are copyrighted. 
 
[applause]  
 
They are. And I really -- all of you. Go online tonight and look. You're going to see that 
they're copyrighted. They're not allowed to be changed. When they're adopted by 
states, states may add 15 percent, but they cannot change any of the standards. That's 
one of the problems. Second, in terms of scripts, if you look, in New York State, Engage 
New York, we spent over $28 million for curriculum. 
 
20:14:29  
 
And that curriculum is full of script. And those scripts -- at Engage New York, at least you 
publicly praised when you've talked to -- I think it was the Governor's Commission, you 
said how wonderful Engage New York is. They truly are scripts. And we find so many 
teachers who are so afraid to go off-script, to not teach exactly what --

Michael Petrilli: 
Sure. Let's talk about -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Michael Petrilli. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
New York is an interesting case, because it is the only state in the country that has 
developed a fully fleshed out curriculum. And I think you can certainly make the case 
that it's too fleshed out. And out -- and good administrators will tell their teachers, "Hey, 
use it as a resource. And it's there for you. But by no means should you be following it 
word-by-word," okay? 
 
20:15:24 
 
 [applause]  
 
You know, it -- most states have the opposite problem, which is that there's nothing. 
There's nothing been developed, and teachers are saying, "I'm desperate for something 
to help me teach to these standards." And what those teachers usually use is Engage 
New York. 
 
 [laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
We have a -- we have to wrap up this section of the debate, but before we do, I want to 
bring a question in from an NPR listener. It's a question for the against side. I'm not 
going to give you time to answer it, because I just want to let it linger, because I like the 
question. It's great -- 
 
[laughter]  
 
-- it's great to think schools are incubators for new ideas, but what if you're in a school 
system with subpar teachers and administration? Surely not all principals are like Carol.

debater in turn. Our motion is this -- Embrace the Common Core. And here to give you 
his summarizing statement in support of this motion, Mike Petrilli, president of the 
Thomas P. Fordham Institute. 
 
Michael Petrilli: 
Great. Thank you, John. And thank you so much to Rick, and Carol, and Carmel for this 
great discussion. It's -- it is so nice for a change to have a discussion about the Common 
Core that is so substantive, because unfortunately, that's not been what's happening for 
much of the last couple of years. I just want to say to some of the points that Rick and 
Carol made. They're very smart to go and to look at some of the specific standards that 
they've got questions about.  
 
20:17:18  
 
And as we said at the beginning, there's no doubt, the Common Core are not perfect, 
nor are they set in stone. You look at states around the country, they have found ways 
to add to the standards. Florida, for example, adding calculus to their math standards 
because of some of the concerns that Rick made. Totally legitimate. Other states adding 
cursive, because parents have been concerned we're not teaching cursive. There are no 
Common Core cops.  States are free to do that, and they should do that.  And they 
should make them their own.  But I want to talk again about what happens on the other 
side of this if you go backwards.  Rick is right.  Rick's book, "Spinning Wheels," you 
should read it.  It's a classic, right?  You want to see spinning wheels?  Go check out 
Oklahoma right now, because that's where you have spinning wheels, because the 
legislature decided out of political pressure to pull back on these standards.  You listen 
to Jeannetta Jante [spelled phonetically], she's a English language arts teacher at 
Oklahoma City's Southeast High School, she called that decision a "travesty."  She says, 
quote, "Now it's like we've wasted teacher training, teacher time, lesson planning,

resources, all of those things we've just done.  The senators have basically said, 'Oops, 
sorry, we didn't mean for you to do all of that.'  
 
20:18:22 
 
The chaos in the classrooms will be great.  The chaos in the classrooms will be 
great."  Okay, we are four years into this.  And many, many teachers, millions of 
teachers across the country are working hard at making Common Core work.  We should 
follow through now on what we have started.  We should make it better as we go.  We 
should address problems and challenges.  But we should embrace the Common 
Core.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Mike Petrilli.  And that's our motion, "Embrace the Common Core."  And 
here to summarize her position against this motion, Carol Burris.  She is principal of 
South Side High School in Rockville Centre, New York. 
 
Carol Burris: 
Well, you know what,  there probably is a mess down in Oklahoma.  But in Ohio what 
they're doing is they're considering adopting the standards of Massachusetts.  Doesn't 
need to be a mess.  It doesn't.  About 10 years ago my husband and I bought a new 
car.  It was gorgeous.  It was silver.  
 
20:19:20 
 
It had heated leather seats, a great steering wheel, lots of pep.  I loved that car.  And 
then one night when we were coming home about a month after we bought it, it broke 
down. The oil light went on.  Took us 10 minutes to get the car going again.  Brought it 
into the station.  They tweaked it a little bit.  And they sent us on our way.  Well, six 
months later the car broke down again, and this time when we brought it in, they 
weren't quite so nice. They started asking us, "Well, what kind of oil were you using?"  A 
year later, same thing happened, car stopped, oil light went on.  We couldn't get it 
started.  The car had to be hauled in.  Now we said we wanted the oil pump repaired, 
and all of a sudden they started talking about how maybe we had not kept it up 
properly.  We just had not implemented that car the right way.  Well, the bottom line 
was when we looked online we found out that a lot of other people were having the 
same problem.

We bought a lemon.  We bought a lemon.  But luckily, luckily, there were other cars for 
us to buy.  I have to tell you, from my perspective, 25 years as an educator of I think one 
of the finest schools in the country, the Common Core is a lemon -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- and the problem is because it is on a national scale it's the only car that they want to 
have on the lot.  Our kids deserve better than this.  They deserve new ideas.  They 
deserve new approaches.  They deserve differentiation.  And they certainly don't 
deserve what has happened in New York where only 30 percent of the kids are deemed 
to be proficient based on an insane standard.

Carmel Martin: 
Thank you, John.  As a mom and a former civil rights attorney, I've seen firsthand the 
consequences of low expectations and their long term effects.  Our children do deserve 
more.  They deserve to be taught to the level that they need to be successful in college 
and career, and that's the overarching goal of these standards, and there's lots of 
evidence to support that it will get them to where they need to be.  The Common Core 
gives teachers the space to create an exciting classroom experience for all rooted high 
expectations, project-based learning, problem solving, and exploring concepts deeply 
instead of focusing on worksheets and rote memorization.

If this were 2012, all four of us -- all four of the panelists here would be in agreement 
that we should not repeal the Common Core.  Carol said as recently as 2012 that higher 
level thinking is more prominent in the Common Core than in all present state 
standards.  And Rick said just last week that he was not necessarily saying to pull out of 
the Common Core.  I think what he's saying tonight is the jury is out.  What Mike and I 
are saying is to -- let's keep moving forward because our children can't afford to wait 
any longer for higher standards, and they can't rely on extraordinary principles or 
teachers to help them get there.  The achievement gaps in our country are staggering, 
and it's time to tackle them aggressively.  Your vote tonight will be closely watched and 
folks outside of this theater may not understand all of the nuance of Rick and Carol's 
position.  A vote to not embrace the Common Core will be interpreted as a vote to 
repeal the Common Core altogether. 
 
20:23:22 
 
And as Mike said, we do not believe that there are good alternatives to that.  There are 
real consequences to this decision, higher versus lower standards, new expenses in 
changing course, frustration for countless educators.  Those consequences should be at 
the forefront of your decision.  Students who come to high school, falling behind, only 
one in 10 of them get to catch up, according to a recent ACT study.  We need to get to 
them earlier. 
 
John Donvan: 
Carmel Martin, I'm sorry, your time is up. 
 
Carmel Martin: 
I urge you to "Embrace the Common Core." 
 
John Donvan: 
Well done, thank you.  Carmel Martin.

And that's our motion, "Embrace the Common Core," and here to summarize his 
position against this motion, Rick Hess.  He is director of educational policy studies at 
the American Enterprise Institute. 
 
Fredrick Hess: 
Thanks, John, it's a pleasure to be with all of you this evening.  Mike, Carmel, thanks for 
a terrific conversation.  Mike and Carmel tonight have repeatedly suggested that the 
Common Core is right on the big things, that all of the concerns, the tests, the curricula, 
the instruction are glitches, they're bumps in the road, they're things to be worked out.   
 
20:24:28  
 
For me, having done this for a while, this all brings to mind the advice offered by a 
thoughtful pundit a few years ago on another major reform effort, No Child Left Behind. 
On reflecting on NCLB, this pundit, who had enthusiastically championed it until he 
soured on it penned a terrific chapter for a book of mine, titled, "The Problem with 
Implementation," is the problem.  The author was our own Mike Petrilli.  In this chapter, 
Mike observed the central task of No Child Left Behind implementation is translating its 
aspirational statements in bold principles into action in the real world.  To work well at 
the local level in real schools affecting real children, its contradictions must be resolved, 
its fuzzy notions must be made crystal clear.  He wrote that when this fuzziness led to 
confusion, the fault must be placed on the law itself, not just on those charged with 
carrying it out. 
 
20:25:24 
 
Mike offered some terrific advice there on this whole question of whether to embrace 
these kinds of changes.  He observed, "Where the implementation of the law has gone 
most smoothly is where at least a handful of states and districts have already paved the 
way."  I think that was great advice.   I think Common Core, like No Child Left Behind, 
certainly deserves its day in the sun.  I'm not opposed to giving it a chance to show what 
it can do.  Happily, states have only begun implementation in earnest in most 
cases.  Until 2013, two thirds of American adults had never even heard of the Common 
Core.  This is actually a propitious moment to hit pause, slow down, figure out what 
we're doing before we get too far downstream.  For that reason, I'd like to ask you 
tonight to please vote against embracing the Common Core. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Rick Hess.

And that concludes our closing statements.  
 
20:26:20 
 
And now it is time to learn which side you feel has argued the best.  We're going to ask 
you again to go to the keypads at your seat.  You've been through this once.  It's the 
same thing.  Push number one if you agree with the motion, "Embrace the Common 
Core."  Push number two if you disagree.  Push number three if you remain or even 
became undecided.  And it will take -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- that can happen.  Nothing wrong with that.  And just -- if you make -- if you push the 
wrong key, correct yourself.  The system will lock in your last vote, and we will lock the 
whole thing out in about 15 seconds.  It looks like everybody's got it on top.  Okay, so we 
are about 90 seconds away from having the results.  And in the meantime I just want to 
say a couple things.  First of all, I really want to congratulate the spirit that the debaters 
brought to the stage tonight.  It's clear that they had sharp disagreements.  It's also 
really clear that they deeply agree in very fundamental ways about the big picture and 
that, that informed the civility and the intelligence that they brought to this argument 
on the stage tonight.   
 
20:27:28  
 
I want to congratulate all of them for the way they did that. 
 
[applause] 
 
And to everyone who got up and asked a question, I think this is the first debate in a 
long, long time where I haven't thrown out a single question.  They were, with a little bit 
of tweaking, they were all good and they were all informative.  They led to a better 
debate for us, so thank you for those contributions, everybody in the audience. 
 
[applause] 
I’d love to have you, as I said in the beginning, please tweet about this debate.  Our 
Twitter handle is @iq2us.  Our hashtag is CommonCore.  I want to let you know that 
we’ve just launched a new app that’s downloadable from the iTunes store and from the 
iphone -- from the Apple store and from the Android store.  The app store at Google 
Play. And this lets you not only get to all of our debates, it lets you vote on our debates, 
see what’s upcoming, so you can get background information, all on your smart phone.

We just launched it about a week and a half ago, and I have to say it’s beautiful and 
elegant, and it’s intelligent.  
 
[laughter] 
 
So, I hope you’ll take a look at it.  Our next debate is right here at the Kauffman Center. 
It’s on Tuesday, September 30th.  The motion that night will be this, flexing America’s 
muscles in the Middle East will make things worse.  Our team arguing for that motion, 
Aaron David Miller.  He is a former Middle East negotiator.  He served two decades at 
the Department of State helping to formulate U.S. policy in the region.  He is against 
flexing our muscle more in the region.  His partner, Paul Pillar, a 28 year veteran of the 
U.S. intelligence community.  He served as a national intelligence officer for the near 
east and South Asia.  Arguing against them, Michael Doran.  He has served on the 
National Security Council as senior director for Near East and North Africa.  And Brett 
Stephens who is a Pulitzer Prize winning foreign affair columnist, deputy page editor for 
the Wall Street Journal.  
 
20:29:27 
 
Again that motion is, flexing America’s muscles in the Middle East will only make things 
worse.  Tuesday, October 7th we’ll be returning to Philadelphia’s National Constitution 
Center.  This is a new initiative in the last several months and the last year.  Intelligence 
Squared is partnering with the National Constitutional Center, doing a specific kind of 
debate that has been really very successful.  It’s where we take a constitutional cut at an 
issue today, by examining so far, we’ve examined twice, the application of specific 
amendments to things that are going on in policy and in the world.  And they have been 
very, very interesting and successful.  And I recommend using our app to go watch these 
debates.  We’re doing one coming up on October 7th.  The motion is this.  The mass 
collection of U.S. phone records violates the fourth amendment.  Philadelphia is a 90 
minute train ride.  Tickets for all debates are available from our website, iq2us.org.  And 
of course, those who can’t join our live audience -- I’ll take that -- there are a lot of other 
ways to catch these debates.  I’ve mentioned them.  You can download the app.  
 
20:30:29 
 
You can watch the live stream on our website, iq2us.org or listen to the debate on NPR 
stations across the nation.  And you can stay in touch with us on Twitter and Facebook. 
By the way we welcome your feedback and topic ideas.  We’ve been getting a lot of 
them lately, and they’re very much in the mix, so we take it seriously.  We’ve gotten 
some very good ideas that I think we’re going to launch into debates in the coming 
seasons, so please keep that up.  All right so, so now it is all in.  Let me find my page on 
this.  Okay, it’s all in.  I have been given the final results.  You have been asked to vote 
twice on this motion, embrace the Common Core.  Once before you heard the 
arguments and once again after you heard the arguments.  And by our rules, the team

that wins is the team that has changed most minds in this hall in New York City in 
percentage point terms.  So let’s get to the results.  In the preliminary vote, embrace the 
Common Core, before the debate, 50 percent agreed with the motion, 13 percent were 
against, 37 percent were undecided.  
 
20:31:28  
 
Those are the first results.  Remember, you have to have changed the numbers more 
than your opponent in order to win, in percentage point terms.  Let’s look at the second 
vote.  Embrace the Common Core, the team arguing for the motion, their second vote 
was 67 percent.  They went from 50 percent to 67 percent, a 17 percent increase.  That 
is the number to beat in percentage points, 17 percent.  Let’s look at the team against 
the motion.  Their second vote was 27 percent, they pulled over 14 percentage points, 
but it was not enough.  The debate goes to the team arguing for the motion, embrace 
the Common Core. 
 
[applause] 
 
Our congratulations to them. Thank you from John Donvan and Intelligence Squared. 
We’ll see you next time.
