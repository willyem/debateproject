 JOHN DONVAN 

Let’s welcome our debaters to the stage, we’re about to begin.  

[APPLAUSE, LOW VOICES]  And if you look at the current issue 

of Newsweek there is an op-ed piece on the topic of the health 

care debate that is by our founding chairman, Robert 

Rosenkranz, pick it up and read it, it’s worth it, and at this point 

I’d like to introduce Robert Rosenkranz, ladies and gentlemen.   

[APPLAUSE]   

 ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Well thank you very much and welcome to this evening’s 

debate.  Well, I assume we’re mostly New Yorkers here, and we 

all know that New York has its problems.  But California’s are 

worse, or at least so New Yorkers like to believe.  California has

Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and way better weather.   But 

California’s credit rating is lower than ours, New York State 

legislators can look at the California legislature, and come 

away with delusions of adequacy.  [LAUGHTER]  The political 

divide between San Francisco liberals and Orange County 

conservatives, is actually more acute than ours.   And in 

California it takes two-thirds of the legislature to impose taxes.  

Which virtually assures recurring budget crises.  California’s 

experiment with direct democracy, the referendum system, has 

demonstrated that voters like to receive benefits from the state, 

but don’t like to pay for them.   A result, I suspect, you are 

shocked, shocked to learn.  [LAUGHTER]  With a looming $20 

billion budget gap, and 1 percent of the taxpayers already 

footing 50 percent of the bills, will California be able to squeak 

by?  Or will it become the Lehman Brothers of state 

government?   Will a vibrant private sector bail out its 

mismanaged state sector.  Or is California our first failed state.  

And let me emphasize the “first” in this proposition.  Are its 

problems the result of a uniquely dysfunctional political 

culture, or are they the harbinger of things to come, to a big-

spending, highly-taxed state, close to home.   With that, we 

have a terrific panel who I think will shed some light on these 

questions and it’s my pleasure now to turn the evening back to 

John Donvan and our panelists tonight.

 JOHN DONVAN  

Round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz, please, thank you.  

[APPLAUSE]  Well, hello everyone, and welcome to another debate 

from Intelligence Squared US, I’m John Donvan of ABC News, 

and once again, it is my pleasure to serve as host and moderator, 

as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the 

Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.   

Six debaters, three against three, will be debating this motion— 

“California is the First Failed State.”  Now, I want to point out 

that this is a debate, it’s not a symposium or a seminar, it is a 

contest.  These two teams are here to win.   And you our 

audience serve as our judges, by the time the debate has 

concluded you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the 

debate and once again after.  Vote on whether you agree with the 

proposition, “California is the First Failed State,” or whether you 

vote against it.  At the end of the debate the team that has 

changed the most minds, will be declared our winner.   So let’s go 

to the preliminary vote, if you look to the right arm of your seat, 

there’s a keypad… numbered 1 through 0, only pay attention to 

keys number 1, 2, and 3, if you agree with the motion, “California 

is the First Failed State,” press number 1.   If you disagree press 

number 2.  If you are undecided, press number 3, and if you 

make a mistake just correct yourself and the system will lock in 

the last key that you pressed.  And I’m gathering from

expressions that everyone has completed this.  No one needs 

more time?  [PAUSE]   Okay.  And so to Round 1, opening 

statements by each debater in turn.  Seven minutes each.  Our 

first debater speaking for the motion, “California is the First 

Failed State,” Andreas Kluth, who is The Economist’s West Coast 

correspondent.  He covers politics, society, and the economy in 

California and the western states, he spent a long time working 

out of New York.   Having made the move to California, Andreas, I 

understand in your office you work from a yoga mat.  

[LAUGHTER]  Is this is not the influence of California, on—    

 ANDREAS KLUTH 

On a tatami mat, in the lotus position, that’s true.   

 JOHN DONVAN 

[LAUGHS]  Ladies and gentlemen, Andreas Kluth—   

 ANDREAS KLUTH 

I’m willing to prove it.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  California is the 

first failed state, and most of you probably believe that already.  

Which is a tactical disadvantage for us on this side, but if you do, 

we want to keep your vote.  For the rest of you, we’d like to 

convince you of that this evening.   And, before I start doing that, 

I just want to clear away something that might be confusing.  The 

proposition is cheeky, as all of you know, all good Oxford-style 

debates start with a cheeky proposition.   The reason this one is 

cheeky, is that “failed states” usually refer to sovereign states.  



Media Transcripts, Inc.

Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Haiti.  And what those have in common, 

is that they have lost a monopoly on legitimate violence, if you 

think that through, or maybe back to Poli. Sci.   When that 

happens, warlords take over or maybe Somalian pirates, and the 

state as such loses authority, well clearly, no one on the stage 

tonight is going to argue in the next two hours that California is 

already ruled by warlords or pirates.   So what are we talking 

about when we talk about one of the 50 states, domestic states.  

We have to agree to a working definition to make this interesting.  

California and other domestic states that may follow have failed, 

if they fail to support their citizens and instead hinder them.   

What’s another way of saying that is, if a state, if the governance 

part of the state as opposed to private industry, can no longer 

address or solve the problems it faces, then it has failed.  

California easily meets those criteria.   And I just want to quickly 

because that timer is running already, run down some of the 

problems to remind you, maybe we can go into them later in 

depth.  Prisons, California has the worst recidivism rate in the 

country, how did it get like that.   Water, it’s an infrastructure 

and a climate issue but it’s also a political, a governance issue.  

Education.  Before California became a failed state in the Pat 

Brown era of the ‘50s and ‘60s it built the best public university 

system in the country, it is currently dismantling that because it 

is now a failed state.   Budgets.  And a state is supposed to have 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 6. 

 

 

 

a budget, to pass it on time, California never does, that started 

well before the recession.  California—or states are supposed to 

pay their bills to their vendors and so forth, as all of you know, 

probably all of you know, California has been paying with 

I.O.U.’s.  Courts.  I asked Ronald George, Chief Justice of the 

Supreme Court, whether he thought it was a failed state, he 

could say [sic] you could argue that, if the state no longer 

administers justice because its courts are closed part of the time, 

and dockets of cases is backlogged.  California has the worst 

credit rating of the 50, you know that, it was just lowered again 

by S&P.   Our opponents may try to convince you tonight that 

this has something to do with the Great Recession, and that as 

soon as there’s a recovery these problems will recede.  It’s not 

true, all of you have heard Warren Buffett say it’s only when the 

tide goes out when you learn who’s swimming naked.  

[LAUGHTER]   California has been undressing since the 1970s, I 

hope to get into that.  I argue that it’s been stark naked since the 

‘90s, and indeed, the tide has just now gone out with the Great 

Recession but that’s not something that happened overnight, the 

failure that is, the nakedness.  It’s just been revealed.   Our 

opponents may also argue that California has problems, but all 

states have problems, as Mr. Rosenkranz reminded you here.  

And that that does not amount to failure, that’s not true, that’s 

not appropriate in the case of California, because only one state 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 7. 

 

 

 

has all problems simultaneously.  And when you have all 

problems simultaneously you tie them together into a straitjacket 

and that’s what California is in, it’s in a straitjacket, because of 

its governance structures.  I want to develop that in the time that 

remains right now a little bit, and then hopefully go deeper into it 

later in the evening to show to you what the unique aspect of that 

confluence is.   Unique number 1.  Three states, for example, 

have the super-majority requirement that both houses of a 

legislature have two-thirds votes to pass a budget, three states.  

Arkansas, Rhode Island, and California, nothing unusual yet.  16 

states have the same super-majority required to raise taxes.   

Only one state has both.  How did California— California is that 

state.  How did California get that second super-majority 

requirement.  It was the infamous Prop 13, I understand it’s 

famous even on this coast…1978 when they started undressing.  

It is part of something called direct democracy that the founders 

of the nation, as opposed to the state, were very skeptical and 

afraid of—about, afraid of.  It includes initiatives, referenda and 

recalls.  24 states have initiatives, have direct democracy.   Only 

one does not allow its legislature, to amend initiatives that its 

own voters have passed, no matter how insane.  Only one state, 

only one state has the process, has really run certifiably amok, 

out of control, insane, in only one state, do the inmates run the 

asylum.   Tonight, you may hear that California, this usually 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 8. 

 

 

 

comes up, has great weather.  You may hear about its beautiful 

redwoods, Yosemite’s gorgeous.  You may hear about the 

vibrancy of Silicon Valley which I used to cover.   All that is true, 

it’s all irrelevant.  Because we’re not talking about whether or not 

the state has assets.  Whether or not there are some good things 

in the state.  Of course there are.   We’re talking about whether 

the state as such, the structures that make the state, the 

governance structures, have failed, and indeed they have, and 

the other states must be very careful unless they have the same 

unique—the same combination of problems that put them in the 

same straitjacket, and also lead to failure.   Our opponents are 

great orators…don’t let them confuse you tonight…  [LAUGHTER]  

I’ll be back in a little, in a few minutes, but for now just 

remember what the definition of a domestic failed state is, 

remember to stay on our side, stay on our side, you probably are 

there already.  California is the first failed state.   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Andreas Kluth.  [APPLAUSE]  Our motion is 

“California is the First Failed State,” you’ve heard the first 

opening statement in support of the motion, now to speak first 

against the motion, I’d like to introduce Gray Davis, the 37th 

governor of California who happens to be like me, Bronx-born.  

Anybody else?  Oh, a lotta hands, lotta hands.   Governor, you 

can start heading for your lectern.  Governor Davis encountered

direct democracy head-on-head when he lost a recall election in 

2003, but prior to that he had won almost every election he had 

ever run in as he served as State Controller and as Lieutenant 

Governor.  He is, though Bronx-born, a true Californian, ladies 

and gentlemen, Gray Davis.   

[APPLAUSE]   

 GRAY DAVIS 

Thank you.  Thank you, John, I’m thrilled to be back in New 

York, as John said I was born here, many of my relatives are 

here, actually most of my relatives.  I graduated from Columbia 

Law School.   And not to be undone, NYU sent me two graduate 

students to help me get reelected in 2002, so.  I’m fond of New 

York, I think I have a sense of how New Yorkers think and I think 

a lot of you probably voted that California is the first failed state, 

so my hope is that I can impress you with what is right about 

California, and why it’s already an asset to the nation, and will be 

more of an asset as we move forward in this global society.  First 

let me acknowledge that there are problems in Sacramento…but 

the shortcomings of our elected officials should not detract from 

the creative contributions of our 37 million citizens.   Our GDP 

which is one way we measure societies in this world, is $1.9 

trillion, far and away the largest in America.  Larger than Russia, 

larger than India, larger than Canada.  In fact the eighth largest 

in the world.  And if we were a separate country, we would be a

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 10. 

 

 

 

member of the G8.   So one way we measure societies in a 

capitalistic world, is by their GDP and certainly California has no 

apologies for that.  I’m also pleased to see that a recent edition of 

Time magazine agreed, and was very bullish on California.   It 

titled its piece, “California is Still the American Dream,” and I 

quote:  “It is”— “it” meaning California— “is the cutting edge of 

America’s future.  It is the greenest, most diverse…most 

global…and most Asian-oriented society at a time when the world 

is moving in all those directions.   It is an unparalleled engine of 

innovation, a Mecca of high-tech, biotech, and now clean-tech.  

In fact, from 2006”— and I’m still quoting—“2006 to 2008, it 

received 60 percent of all the clean-tech investments in this 

country, and in 2008 it received more venture capital funds than 

the other 49 states combined.”   With all of its problems it still 

managed to nurture some of the most innovative companies in 

the world, Google, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, MySpace, Facebook, 

Twitter, YouTube, Cisco, Intel, Disney, eBay, and many other 

companies that are helping invent the future for California and 

for the— for America.   California is all about change.  It likes to 

get there first, and it frequently does, it was the first state to 

regulate greenhouse gases.  It was the first to allow full-scale 

stem-cell research.   It was the first to establish renewable energy 

portfolio standards.  What do I mean by that.  It said to its 

utilities, use renewable energy.  Depend less on fossil fuel.  As 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 11. 

 

 

 

governor I was proud to sign all those bills into law, but prouder 

still, to be part of a 35-year tradition of promoting energy 

efficiency and energy conservation.   Now why am I talking about 

this.  Because, the green economy is the next great wave in the 

American economy.  We have to be green, we have to be 

reorienting the grid, we have to live more lightly on the planet if 

we are going to compete globally.  35 years ago, during the first 

energy crisis, California decided, if it wanted to promote 

conservation, it has to give the utilities a financial incentive to 

permit that.   So it said to the utilities, you can make more 

money if you encourage your customers to consume less.  And 

ever since then, we’ve been regulating everything that uses 

electricity, from appliances, refrigerators, dishwashers, homes, all 

kinds of businesses, cars, and even lately flat-screen TVs, and 

along the way, we saved rate-payers $56 billion, and avoided 

building 24 new power plants.   In fact, our electricity growth has 

been nada, zippo, zero, over 30 years, as we became the largest 

state in America--the rest of the country is more than 50 percent.  

Why do I tell you that?  Because how America obtains energy in 

the future, will be critical to our economy, our environment, and 

to national security.   And I submit to you that California’s 

proven leadership in this area over the last 35 years, will stand 

this nation in very good stead.  Now to be sure, we have problems 

in Sacramento, but believe me, the voters have tuned in to this 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 12. 

 

 

 

issue, and they have already made change that’s substantial.   

For many years the legislators drew their own districts, meaning 

they decided in what district they would run, they decided you 

would be in my district, you would not.  And so not surprisingly, 

they almost never lose.   Governor Schwarzenegger proposed a 

redistricting plan, it passed, I supported it because I believe it’s 

time the voters draw the line, not the people [sic], and it’s time we 

bring accountability to Sacramento, that will kick in in 2012 and 

that will make a big difference.   Now voters get punished if they 

react harshly towards their core constituencies, Republican-

raised taxes, they have all kinds of recall attempts against them, 

Democrats punish the teachers, there’s a primary opponent next 

time.  Under a redistricting plan, if you don’t solve the problem, 

you will get defeated.   Similarly in June there is an open 

primary…a change I predict California will embrace, I support it, 

I’m the only governor elected in an open primary, the Supreme 

Court of the United States struck it down, but they have 

approved this version.  It’s essentially a municipal election.   

[00:30:02:06]  If anyone can vote, independents, Republicans and 

Democrats, and you can vote for a Republican for governor or a 

Green Party for governor or a Democrat for governor.  The top two 

vote-getters run off in the general election, even if they’re from 

the same party.   That’s going to produce pragmatic, moderate 

problem-solving candidates.  Finally there’s a call for a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 13. 

 

 

 

constitutional convention.  I support that idea.  It’s time we 

eliminated in my judgment the two-thirds vote requirement to 

pass a budget.   Yes, we have a two-thirds vote requirement to 

pass a budget, and a separate one to pass the budget.  Just that 

requirement to get a two-thirds vote to pass a budget is the 

reason we are always late, it’s ridiculous, only three other states 

have it.   [00:30:41:17]  I think that’s the kinda thing a 

constitutional convention will change, and if the changes are, are 

sensible, the voters will accept it.  So in short, our private sector 

is the envy of the world, and innovation will lead America, into a 

future that is brighter and stronger.   Our public sector is on the 

mend and will get better at the end of 2010.  Vote no, number 2, 

vote no.   

[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Gray Davis.  Our motion is “California is the First 

Failed State,” and up now to argue for this motion, to argue that 

California is the first failed state I’d like to introduce Sharon 

Waxman, who has a long and distinguished career working for 

the New York Times and the Washington Post both as a foreign 

correspondent and as a reporter covering the entertainment 

industry from the inside out, she’s written books about it.   She 

has started a Web portal on the entertainment industry known as 

The Wrap.com, and though you are arguing that California’s a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 14. 

 

 

 

failed state you believe enough to base your business there.  Am I 

right about that?   

 SHARON WAXMAN 

Yeah, I like the weather.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Okay.  [LAUGHTER]  It makes sense, ladies and gentlemen, 

Sharon Waxman.   

[APPLAUSE]   

SHARON WAXMAN 

So before I get going I just want to know if Gray Davis’s relatives 

are going to get to vote this evening?  [LAUGHTER]  If they’re 

filling half the room.  I come to you tonight as a mother, as an 

engaged citizen, and as a journalist who has covered California 

for the past 15 years.  So let’s start with the area I know best that 

I deal with every day and that’s Hollywood.  Hollywood, the 

symbol, a signature of California.   Part of the dream of what 

California represents.  And a symbol of course to the world of 

California’s industry, creativity, prosperity, and the values of 

American culture.  Here’s the only problem with that.   

Hollywood’s not really in Hollywood anymore.  It’s gone to New 

Mexico, and Arizona, and New York, and Vancouver, and London.  

So Avatar, the movie that is now breaking all the box-office 

records was really filmed in New Zealand.  And Twilight, that 

series that all your kids, all your daughters are going to see was 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 15. 

 

 

 

filmed in Vancouver, and Harry Potter, that series of extremely 

successful movies was filmed in London.  So the people who run 

the industry, which is a fairly small number of people,  they still 

live in Brentwood and Bel Air and Beverly Hills and places like 

that but the hundreds and thousands of jobs that produce this, 

juggernaut of—not just of jobs but of tax revenues to the state, 

has largely fled, film production is down to half of what it was in 

California in 1996.   This is the way things are going, and the 

reason for me it has a lot to do with California failing to create a 

sense of connectedness with this incredibly core industry, it’s so 

much of what we ought to be proud of, by the way of course the 

entertainment industry is one of America’s top exports, not only 

California.  But it doesn’t feel like that there is a connection 

between what the state represents, and the identification that we 

have with Hollywood and that vast entertainment industry, with 

the state, and why is that.   It seems to me that the state has 

neglected it as it has neglected so many things.  And that goes to 

me to sort—one of the, one of my big observations about living in 

California especially after having lived around the world for much 

of the beginning of my adult life, is that there isn’t that sense of 

connectedness, as a community.   And the state plays a big role 

in that.  Where we live in California, is largely in gated 

communities, with private security, we live in isolation, and this 

is nothing new, we all know that.  People, you can go to a place 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 16. 

 

 

 

like Koreatown which has the largest ethnic community of 

Koreans outside of Korea, 800,000 people.   That community 

feels extremely Korean.  They feel extremely connected to the 

country of their parents’ birth or of their birth or of their 

ancestors.  I don’t think they feel Californian.  And I think that 

that’s true of so many of the ethnic groups that have come to live 

in enclaves in California.   I see that as a failure of the state to 

create that sense of identity among them.  Here’s another big 

thing that bothers me.  People who know me know that this is my 

pet peeve.  The state has not provided an infrastructure that 

allows us to be a community, and community is all about what 

the state is there to protect, and preserve, and to nourish.   So I 

can’t tell you how many times I have driven up to the edge of the 

10 freeway from where I live in Santa Monica, peered over the 

railing, hoping to go to a Lakers game, or to visit a museum, or to 

go visit Disney Hall for the first time which I would have never 

succeeded in doing when they were actually playing a concert, 

and, dared to jump into that essential parking lot of the 10 

freeway.   That’s because, there isn’t a transportation system that 

works.  We are essentially a city that sits on the roads, and that 

we have of course made a decision not to have a public 

transportation of any significance, and the roads are long-

neglected and the state has not invested in them,  to me, that is,  

as a member of-- somebody who wants to participate in the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 17. 

 

 

 

community, I feel I can’t get to the community, and that to me is 

a failure of the state.  Finally, I want to speak to you as a mother.  

I’m the mother of three children.   And I moved my family from 

Europe actually, to raise them in California, and we all, all of us 

in our family, my husband and I and kids who were then small, 

were aware of what it meant to go pursue the California dream.   

That dream has really turned out to be one that we have to create 

for ourselves.  We came from Europe where public transport was 

something that was a given.  Medical care was a given, education 

was a given.  At the very least, I knew that coming to California, 

that I was moving to a state that had the best public university 

system in the country, if not the world.   Today, that system has 

been, I feel, taken away from us.  Because of the problems with 

the state, they just, again, you probably all read about it, raised 

the fees some 30 percent in the UC system, and, they’re now 

approaching the fees of a private university, it now costs about 

the same to go to UCLA Law School—my son the lawyer, I’m just 

still hoping—[LAUGHS] as it is to go to a private law school.  How 

is it that the state is abdicating its role in creating a generation of 

the best and the brightest in the state of California, which was all 

about what California represented.  So…all of this together, leads 

me to say to you, that California is a failed state.  I commend the 

governor on all of the changes that he’s laying out as hoping to 

come to California, and, as an entrepreneur having started The 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 18. 

 

 

 

Wrap.com, I can tell you that there are wonderful companies 

there—and I chose to start my company in California, however,   

that doesn’t mean that that is because the state encourages us to 

do so or allows us to do so, that is a testament to the innovation 

that the citizens and the residents of California have shown.  It is 

not proof that the state has not failed.  And so I would like you to 

vote for the proposition that California is the first failed state.   It 

has neglected its fundamental industries, it has neglected its 

fundamental functions, and it has neglected its fundamental 

values as a state.    

 JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Sharon Waxman.  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you, Sharon 

Waxman.  Okay, a reminder of where we are, we are halfway 

through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared US 

debate, I’m John Donvan of ABC News, we are listening to 

opening statements from each side.   We have six debaters, two 

teams of three and they are fighting it out over this motion, 

“California is the First Failed State.”  Now on to our next speaker 

against the motion…I’d like to introduce Van Jones, Van Jones 

was the founder, co-founder of the Ella Baker Foundation for 

Human Rights and Green for All.   He was part of the Obama 

administration as special advisor for green jobs, he resigned that 

position after being targeted in a nasty political imbroglio, but his 

standing in the greenest state in the nation is enormously high in

the green movement, and Van, I saw on Facebook only today, a 

“Draft Van Jones for Governor” page?  Would…  [LAUGHS]  

Would you want the job?   

 VAN JONES 

Well, I—it would be and I’ll tell you this.  One of the—I’m not 

running, but—  [LAUGHTER]  Be an honor to serve butt--and I’ll 

tell you why, first of all, California is not a failed state and our 

colleagues have pretty much conceded that they cannot win this 

argument based on the assertion that it’s a failed state so instead 

they point to some failings.   But what they haven’t told you is 

that every single one of the problems—structural and otherwise—

that have been pointed to you, have solutions, and the solutions 

are now on the way.  We have in our state…  We are the biggest 

state—we have some of the biggest problems—we also have the 

biggest potential for problem solving, and the largest number of 

problem solvers.  So every one of the structural problems that 

has been pointed out—from redistricting to the tax issues, to the 

budget issues—have gathered the combined wisdom across the 

political spectrum, there are now ballot measures moving 

forward, there are solutions for these problems.  To say that 

California is a failed state is different than saying it has some 

failings.  We have some serious failings, but we also have a set of 

assets, that our friend was trying to make sure you didn’t pay 

attention to, that will help us solve these problems.

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 20. 

 

 

 

 

First of all, when you look at a state like California, you look at a 

state that, on the three critical issues that are most important for 

our country, California is not failing—it is succeeding and it is 

leading.  What are the three critical issues?  Number one, how 

will we power America, as the governor just talked about.  How 

will we power this country?  Will we continue to rely on the post 

well oil strategy that we have been stuck in, with petroleum and 

coal for 100, 150 years now—it’s the post whale oil strategy—we’ll 

continue with that?  Or will, will we innovate our way out?  Will 

we invent and invest our way out?  In California, that is what we 

are doing.  In a failed state, capital does not flow in—capital flows 

out.  In California, we have quadrupled—in the past two years—

the amount of venture capital flowing into the state, because we 

are trying to solve the biggest problem humanity faces:  the 

problem of global warming, and the biggest problem our country 

faces:  the problem of energy independence.  California is leading 

and succeeding in that.  We just attracted a company, Electric 

Vehicles International, to come and build zero emission cars in 

California.  They could have gone anywhere in the world.  They 

came to California because of the policy certainty, because of the 

consumer demand, because we are on the front edge.  We have 

policies in place passed—despite all the problems with our 

legislature—we have passed on a bipartisan basis with a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 21. 

 

 

 

Republican governor…a Democratic legislature, AB 32, our 

Global Warming Solution Act, which will drive the creation of 

400,000 clean and green jobs.  We have set high aspirations with 

regard to renewable energy.  Possibly, as many as three-quarters 

of a million jobs that will be created there.  15,000 jobs right now 

in solar, in the solar industry, and growing.  A failed state doesn’t 

do that.  That is not a failed state. 

 

Number two yes, Sacramento has a ton of problems.  Help is on 

the way.  Great ideas are on the way.  But the entire State of 

California did not live in Sacramento.  We have an incredible level 

of innovation at the governance level, cities, and regionally across 

the state, because the second big problem is—how are going to 

live together in cities?  How are we going to live together at a 

community level?  Can we solve problems?  You see in California, 

problems are being solved every day—tough problems.  Look at 

the problems with the port of Los Angeles—just to brag a little bit 

on the people of California—where the pollution was so bad that 

little kids who live close to the port of Los Angeles were getting 

asthma and dying, and people said that we can’t solve this 

problem because of the logjams and all the special interests.  

They got together, they sat down, they came up with a Clean 

Truck Program that helped lift the living standards of 10,000 

truckers.  Got new technology in those trucks on the roads, and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 22. 

 

 

 

took asthma inhalers out of little girls’ and little boys’ pockets.  

That is the kind of problem solving that’s going on at the local 

level.  In Fresno, you have a wonderful new mayor, Ashley 

Swearengin, who has been able to pull people together in the 

agricultural heartland of our state, and create 19,000 new jobs, 

through a regional economic initiative.  In Northern California, 

you have mayors like Gavin Newsom, Ron Dellums and others 

who had come together, who have come up with local creative 

financing to get green home improvements going, weatherization 

and solar panels attached to property taxes so people can 

actually get all these new technologies going.  And these are the 

kinds of things that are happening on a daily basis.  And those 

things don’t happen in a failed state.  In a failed state, when 

things are tough, people turn on each other.  In California, people 

are turning to each other, and working together across lines of 

class and color. 

 

And the last thing I want to say is that the, the third big 

challenge for this country and for this world is—how are we going 

to live together?  In the age of this kind of diversity, how are we 

going to live together?  There is a miracle every single day in 

California, a miracle.  And it’s a miracle of cooperation.  In 

Oakland, California, there are 30 to 40 different languages 

spoken in the public schools—30 to 40 different languages 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 23. 

 

 

 

spoken in the public schools.  To the extent that there is 

conflict—it’s not about that…it’s not about that.  We have been 

able to figure out a way to come together, to work together.  That 

is not just a good example for the United States…that’s a good 

example for the world.  There is no place in the world that has 

the kind of diversity and density that we have…that manages to 

do it with elegance, that manages to do it successfully.  And 

when you have a state where 20 years ago there was a 

conflagration over race and ethnicity—people remember Los 

Angeles 20, almost 20 years ago.  Somebody stood up and said, 

“Can’t we all get along?  Can’t we all get along?”  Californians 

have answered that question—yes we can, yes we can get along—

and we do it every day. And it’s out of that community of many 

colors, many classes, with every faith, every sexuality, working 

together on a daily basis, that great solutions have come in our 

economy, have come in local governments, and are now coming 

from our state governance. 

 

This is not a failed state.  We have some failings, but this state is 

a state that is now rallying to solve those problems.  Don’t vote 

against us, vote for us.  Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE] 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Van Jones.  Our motion is, “California is the First 

Failed State.”  And now to argue for that motion, to argue that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 24. 

 

 

 

California is the first failed state, I would like to introduce Bobby 

Shriver, who is a councilman in Santa Monica and co-founder of 

One.org, and a scion of one of America’s greatest political 

families, ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Shriver. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  I also want to put in a plug 

for Red, which I started also with my great colleague, Bono, my 

partner—which I always like saying.  Because most of my life, 

people have been saying other things about me.  I was President 

Kennedy’s nephew.  When my dad started the Peace Corps, I was 

Sergeant Shriver’s son.  When my mom started the Special 

Olympics, I was Eunice Shriver’s son.  And then a terrible thing 

happened in our family—my sister went on national television 

and became the host of the CBS Morning News.  So four 

brothers, very competitive Irish family, were faced with the 

prospect that we were going to be known forever as Maria 

Shriver’s brothers.  [LAUGHTER]  So we had a meeting—what 

could we do about it?  And we had various ideas, none of them 

very good.  And at one point, one of my brothers said, “Well, face 

it, you know, it’s done, and it can’t get any worse.”  And then 

Maria got married.  [LAUGHTER]  So, I love it when I go and see 

in the program that I am Bono’s partner, because I am really 

tired of being Arnold Schwarzenegger’s brother-in-law.  

[LAUGHTER] 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 25. 

 

 

 

 

I appreciated our eloquence of some of our colleagues, but I want 

to point out very, very specifically that all of the answers are on 

the way.  They are not here now.  And I can tell you in local 

government, where I serve on the City Council in Santa Monica, 

that things are bad.  We are lucky in Santa Monica because we 

have a great, diverse tax base.  But just to give you a couple of 

illustrations…  Our redevelopment agency had a budget this year 

of 30 million dollars—the state took 22 million of that.  How can 

you work on that basis?  And this is a reminder also, that when 

you talk about the state, you are not talking about Google and 

Intel…and you are not talking about local government…you are 

talking about the state government.  It’s very important.  The 

state is a constitutional entity, it’s a legal entity.  It’s not 

California.  When Steve Jobs writes on every Apple product, 

“designed in California, assembled in China,” he is not talking 

about designed in the State House of California…he is talking 

about in the culture of California, which I think we all agree is 

the greatest culture in America and maybe in the world.  

[APPLAUSE]  Thank you.  There are local Californias in the 

culture. 

 

Think about it.  Right now…  A good interesting point, segue, I’ll 

go to your idea.  There is no art education in the state in the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 26. 

 

 

 

public schools.  We are the last in the state, in all of the 50 

states.  We are below Guam in arts education. 

 MAN IN AUDIENCE 

Wow. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

I am serious.  I mean, it’s…  It’s kind of a little funny, but it’s 

hard to believe really…  And that’s a state responsibility.  The 

money is not there.  Why is the money not there?  Because the 

people have lost confidence in the government obviously. 

 

I’ll give you another example.  In Los Angeles, we have the biggest 

homeless population in America, 80,000-plus people.  The L.A. 

County Jail is the largest mental health facility in the world…in 

the world.  If you go there, every single one of you—I don’t care 

what your background or point of view on this debate would be—

would be sickened to see what’s going on in there.  There is a 

famous quote from the, uh, I think it’s Hammerati [PH] who said, 

“The purpose…  One of the purposes of government is to protect 

the weak from the strong.”  We have completely failed.  You go in 

that L.A. County Jail and you will see the weakest people in our 

society…mentally ill people living in cages…there are 14 full-time 

pharmacists to medicate them…in Downtown L.A. 

 

Of the 85 or some-odd thousand people that are homeless, about 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 27. 

 

 

 

a third are veterans.  We have a 400-acre property in West L.A. in 

Westwood…that have empty buildings in it…which were built as 

mental institutions for veterans that are empty—and have been 

empty for more than 20 years.  Why is that?  The state hasn’t 

cooperated with the feds to fix that… I don’t know…I can’t come 

here and give you an answer.  I have been trying to fix it for the 

last five years, and so far I have failed.  Although President Bush 

and Secretary Nicholson did designate three of the buildings for 

homeless veterans—which is a positive thing.  And I understand 

that one of the answers on the way—there is 50 million dollars in 

the new defense appropriations bill for that building, which 

would be a great thing.  But the fact that people burnt…  And in 

my little ol’ Santa Monica, a man burnt to death in a 

dumpster…a homeless man, burnt to death in a dumpster 

several months ago…is unacceptable. 

 

And you would say, well, that, you…  as a senior official of the 

state said to me, “Well, Bob, you know, you gotta calm down.  

You know, you gotta…  You are very hopped up about this 

homeless thing.”  And he said, “Why are you so hopped up about 

it?”  I said, “I am afraid my mom—God bless her and God rest her 

soul—is going to hear that a homeless guy burnt to death in a 

dumpster in my jurisdiction”…which is what she used to call it, 

“my jurisdiction,” not “my constituency.”  [LAUGHTER]  Because 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 28. 

 

 

 

she would be enraged. 

 

So, going on to the kinds of things that Sharon said.  The public 

community—which is really the primary goal of the state—not to 

get too esoteric about it—but to have a kind of political 

compassion for people does not exist.  You can’t have that many 

homeless people…you can’t have the underfunding of education 

that exists…you can’t have that many homeless veterans…and 

say that the state has been successful in creating—amongst its 

citizens—a concept of political compassion.  That we are going to 

get together…  We have community interests.  We are going to get 

together and we are going to do something about them.  And 

ideas are on the way…  And green tech, great.  It’s all fantastic.  

For the least of these, it’s not fantastic in California.  It’s really 

not. 

 

I’ll give you another example—a local example.  The City of 

Beverly Hills has a school system, Santa Monica has one.  The 

state is organizing school districts like that.  They had kids from 

out of the City of Beverly Hills in that district, because the state 

used to pay—and still may—a certain amount per student.  So 

you would bring people from out of your district who were not 

there and educate them.  They changed that formula recently, 

and what did Beverly Hills do?—and they are not bad people—



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 29. 

 

 

 

they expelled all those kids.  Why?  We are not getting paid for it 

anymore.  That’s a state failure—not a Beverly Hills failure, not a 

failure of those communities. 

 

So as you think about how you are going to vote, it’s very 

important to say…  And I like to be optimistic—and I am 

optimistic.  When they asked me, which side of this debate did I 

want to be on, I said I wanted to be on this one.  And they said, 

well, don’t you want to be on the optimistic side?  I said, this is 

the optimistic side.  [LAUGHTER]  This is the optimistic side.  

Because if you don’t know that the problem is as bad as it is…if 

you don’t go to the L.A. County Jail and see that…you think—

and I mean this respectfully—that help is on the way.  Help is not 

on the way.  We, this year…I’ll give you one final example.  The 

CalPERS—the pension charged to little, to cities—going up 25 

percent.  In our budget, that’s a breaker, you know?  So it has 

nothing to do, as I said—I am repeating myself—with Google…it 

has to do with, can you run the trains on time?  Thank you.  

[APPLAUSE] 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Bobby Shriver.  “California is the First Failed State” is 

our motion.  And you have all heard all of the debaters but one.  

And next up to argue against this motion, Lawrence ODonnell, 

who has one of these Renaissance men résumés, having held 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 30. 

 

 

 

positions as a political analyst for MSNBC and having served as 

Chief of Staff for the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, and for 

being a writer and producer on West Wing and for being an actor 

on Big Love as well.  It’s a lot.  Thanks for coming by.  

[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE] 

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

Do I…? 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Lawrence ODonnell. 

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

Thank you.  Do I really have seven minutes?  Because, you know, 

on MSNBC, I never get out more than a sentence and a half 

before Pat Buchanan interrupts me, so [LAUGHTER] I don’t know 

that I have seven minutes.  I had some prepared material, which 

I will use some of.  But I would like to very quickly go through 

some of the points that you have heard from the presenters of 

this preposterous idea. 

 

I want to though give you the correct concept that you are aiming 

for here, in that, in the title of this proposition, is it the first, the 

first failed state?  What that means is, is it the worst of 50 states?  

All this side has to do—all it has to do—is give you the idea that 

there might be somewhere [LAUGHTER]…in the 50 states 

somewhere…one—one—that’s doing something worse than 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 31. 

 

 

 

California…or maybe doing everything worse than California.  

And oh, by the way, might also be a slightly less desirable place 

to live.  [LAUGHTER]  That’s our chore.  We have to find you one 

that you don’t want to live in. 

 

And you know, the proposition was defined by Andreas at the 

beginning.  He had to admit that it was a cheeky proposition.  

The backing off from the strength of the declaration and the 

proposition.  He mentioned recidivism rates in California 

prisons—they are not good.  Crime is down, does that count?  

Does it matter that in Los Angeles crime is down dramatically 

because the mayor had the wisdom to import the police 

commissioner that Rudy Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani’s ego couldn’t 

stand in this city, Bill Bratton?  [LAUGHTER]  Bill Bratton came 

out to L.A. in the process… and through an exercise of 

government—local government and local police work—got that 

crime rate down dramatically, as he did here. 

 

You will hear about different problems.  You will hear Bobby 

talking about the homeless.  That’s important.  That is, that is 

tragic.  But remember what the case is here.  The case is, is it 

somehow a California issue?  Is what Bobby talked about a 

California issue?  California has more homeless people than any 

other state.  It has more wealth than any other state.  It has more 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 32. 

 

 

 

poverty than any other state.  It has more agricultural production 

than any other state.  It has more people.  It has more.  Every 

single thing they will tell you about anecdotally—yes, California 

has the most of it. But as we sit here in the lower end of 

Manhattan, is it conceivable…is it conceivable that a homeless 

person has died in gruesome circumstances, in gruesome 

circumstances in this zip code, ever?  Or maybe, how often?  Is 

that the question for this zip code? 

 

You know, Sharon mentions getting around is difficult.  The 

traffic is hard.  It is hard.  It’s hard to get your car to a Dodgers 

game from Santa Monica, where Sharon and I live, that is true.  

What time do you have to leave to get a 7:00 P.M. flight from 

JFK?  [LAUGHTER]  From here.  Not from up in the Upper West 

Side, where it’s even more difficult.  But what time…?  When 

would you leave?  3:00?  [LAUGHTER]  I mean, you know, factor 

in some security issues at the airport…  I don’t take 7:00 P.M. 

flights from JFK, because I can’t get there.  It’s just not going to 

work—I am going to have to surrender too much of the day. 

 

The budget cuts in the university system, budget cuts—

educational budget cuts have been mentioned.  Take your time.  

Take all the time you need to come up with the name of a better 

public university—not in the 50 states, in the world—a better 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 33. 

 

 

 

public university than the University of California at Berkeley.  

Take your time.  We have all night.  [LAUGHTER] 

 

The delicious irony…the delicious irony of having this debate…in 

this state…  [LAUGHTER]  Today’s local paper, The New York 

Times, in its seemingly endless editorial series called “The Failed 

State.”  [LAUGHTER]  It stars—as usual—Albany.  [LAUGHTER, 

APPLAUSE] They have…  This one happens to be about the ethics 

bill that they are… the improvement in the ethics program that 

they are trying to introduce in Albany.  Utterly hopeless.  You 

would think there would be some momentum for that—after Joe 

Bruno gets convicted, [LAUGHTER] of actually running 

businesses out of his office and all other sorts of illegalities—

there would be some momentum for it.  It’s hopeless, it won’t 

happen.  You don’t know what the outside income is of your state 

legislators—and you don’t know it by law.  So when you want to 

have this debate about failed states and failed state 

governments—with the state legislature that you have—having it 

here is cheeky.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE] 

 

I lived here longer than I have lived in Los Angeles.  I worked in 

government with Senator Moynihan.  Very much concerned with 

issues facing this state.  Very much concerned with its fair share, 

for example.  The problem…  And what we discovered…and what 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 34. 

 

 

 

we harped on endlessly back in the ‘80s and ‘90s was New York 

sends more money to the federal government than it gets back—

hence, all of its budget problems.  Well, the problem is much 

worse in California.  California gets 79 cents back for every dollar 

that it sends to the federal government.  So the reason you don’t 

have 40 other so-called failed states is because California tax 

money is paying for Alabama, it’s paying to keep Alaska running, 

it’s paying to keep Arkansas afloat.  You can’t balance any of the 

books in those states without the money that comes out of 

California pockets to fund it. 

 

There is much more to be said about this.  I am running out of 

time to do it.  I didn’t think I had six minutes… seven minutes, 

thank you.  [APPLAUSE] 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Lawrence ODonnell.  And that concludes Round 1 of 

this Intelligence Squared debate.  [APPLAUSE]  This is a debate 

from Intelligence Squared U.S.  I am John Donvan of ABC News, 

serving as moderator.  And our motion is “California is the First 

Failed State.”  We asked you in the audience—who will be serving 

as our ultimate judges—before the debate began…to tell us where 

you stood on this issue.  We had you all vote.  I now have the first 

results of that vote, and we do have a contest.  Before the debate, 

on the motion “California is the First Failed State,” 31 percent of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 35. 

 

 

 

you were for the motion, 25 percent against, and 44 percent are 

undecided.  So it’s really wide open. 

 

Now moving on to Round 2.  And in Round 2, the debaters 

address each other directly, and they also take questions from 

myself and from you in the audience.  When I come to you in the 

audience—which will be in a few minutes— if you raise your 

hand, I will find you.  And we would like you to rise.  If you are a 

member of the news media, we would appreciate it if you would 

identify yourself as such.  And when you take the microphone, 

hold it about a fist’s amount away from where you are speaking, 

so that the NPR stations can hear you clearly, as well as 

Bloomberg.  And I really want to urge you to keep the questions 

to 30 seconds, and really to make them questions.  Don’t argue 

with the panel.  Questions, with a question mark at the end of it.  

[LAUGHTER] 

 

Round 1, our middle round.  And I begin with the question to the 

team that is arguing that California is the first failed state.  You 

have been making an argument—primarily, not entirely—but 

primarily that the failure of the State of California is largely a 

political failure, the failure of the political system leading to 

gridlock, and as a result, lack of services.  The other team is 

arguing about…  They are listing several kinds of successes.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 36. 

 

 

 

They are listing successes in innovation, and in technology, and 

in the development of greening the state, and stem cells, and 

personal connections, political connections on the small scale. 

They are coming back at you with success. 

 

Andreas, clearly, of The Economist, well, what’s wrong with that 

argument? 

 ANDREAS KLUTH 

Well, in particular, Governor Gray Davis was making that point.  

I wrote down a direct quote from you, Governor, “In California, 

the private sector is the envy of the world.  The public sector is on 

the mend.”  You asked me, “What’s wrong with the logic of the 

first part?”  And in fact, I would like to do that, and the second 

part as well. 

 

And we examined the first part, and go and take a larger period of 

history—a few hundred years.  The most elegant leather shoes 

come from a town nearly Bologna in northern Italy.  The best 

violins come from another town in northern Italy.  That’s been 

that way for hundreds of years.  Would you honestly make the 

case…?  Would you have made the case for much of post-war 

history that Italy was not a failed state in the European Union 

because they had a great shoe industry and a great violin 

industry [LAUGHTER] in the northern Italy?

 JOHN DONVAN 

Gray Davis, do respond. 

 ANDREAS KLUTH 

It is irrelevant.  The other point—just briefly.  You cannot 

seriously say that the public sector is on the mend—at the very 

moment when they are dismantling entire government programs 

that were intended to protect the weakest.  And people are 

literally going to die, certain old people at home, because home 

visits are stopping. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Andreas, let’s now have Gray Davis respond to your first point. 

 GRAY DAVIS 

The state is not an abstraction.  It is the sum total of the energy, 

the vibrancy, the creativity and the innovation of 37 million 

people.  It is an exciting place to live because when we have 

problems, we don’t moan and groan.  We don’t bemoan our fate.  

We say, we are going to solve it, we are going to figure it out, we 

are going to do something different.  So for Andreas to dismiss all 

the energy, the excitement, the creativity that is producing the 

iPhone and the social networking, and alternative energy, we…  

My God, we have got ExxonMobil investing 600 million dollars 

into a San Diego project that will turn algae into oil.  I mean, if 

that’s not the establishment saying you are doing something 

smart in California, I don’t know what that’s about.  Now to say 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 38. 

 

 

 

that’s not part of the state, to say that the state is just some civil 

servants and some black boxes, we don’t know anything about it.  

The state are human beings, getting up every day, doing their 

best to make the world a better place.  Expecting to succeed, 

frequently succeeding, but realizing that risk takers though they 

are, failure will eventually…  Well, failure will occasionally occur. 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

Governor, did you say 60 million…? 

 GRAY DAVIS 

Wait, let me just… 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

…or 60 billion?  I just want to point out… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

Let me just say this…  That failure will occur occasionally when 

you take risk.  But they don’t see failure as the end of the 

journey—they see it as an occasional stop on the road to success.  

That’s what separates California from a lot of other parts of the 

world.  And that’s why it is—and will continue to be—a 

successful state, despite what is happening in Sacramento. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Sharon Waxman. 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

Yeah, I had a question.  ExxonMobil, you say was 60 million 

dollars in San Diego? 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 39. 

 

 

 

 GRAY DAVIS 

600 million dollars… 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

600 million dollars… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

…in an algae to oil project. 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

Right, OK.  So the last quarterly statement for ExxonMobil, they 

were…  Their profits were in the multiple billions of dollars.  So in 

terms of their investments…  And that’s a small multiple for… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

Yeah, but algae to oil… 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

…for a company like… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

And they are…  And we are looking into algae and oil in New 

York?  Are we looking to algae and oil in Kansas?  Are we looking 

to algae and oil in Mississippi? 

 ANDREAS KLUTH 

They are in Nevada and Arizona… 

 JOHN DONVAN

 JOHN DONVAN 

Lawrence, Lawrence…

If there is one state that’s doing less… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Lawrence… 

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

…on oil to algae, we win. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Lawrence, I just…  [LAUGHTER]  I just want to make one point…  

I am going to refer to Governor Davis as Gray Davis throughout 

the debate, not out of any disrespect for the office, but because in 

the debates we keep everything on a first name basis, and I want 

to make sure that is clear.  No disrespect is intended, and I hope 

nobody takes it that way.  And Lawrence, I was talking all over 

you.  And it looked great, so go at it again. 

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

Well, you know, you are going to hear a lot about budget cutting 

and they are going to…  You know, they are going to have to cut 

back on home healthcare visits and things like that.  There are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 42. 

 

 

 

43 states—43 states—that have cut their enacted budgets of 

2009.  They enacted budgets for 2009, they have—43 of them 

went back and cut them, OK?  Tomorrow’s newspaper will reveal 

to you that the governor’s latest idea—your governor’s, New York 

governor’s, latest idea—is the largest cut in school aid in more 

than two decades.  That’s the latest idea for how to get things 

going correctly in Albany.  And now in searching for new areas of 

revenue so they don’t have to cut quite so much money, the 

brilliant idea that your governor here in New York is proposing 

is—to legalize Ultimate Fighting.  [LAUGHTER]  Congratulations. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Bobby Shriver? 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

I just…  And since Lawrence is so funny and so experienced, I 

just have to do a few little, catch-ups here.  They don’t win if 

there is another failed state.  [LAUGHTER]  That’s not true.  It, 

it’s whether this is the first failed state.  So he would have to say 

that New—and which he was actually saying… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

That New York was first. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

…right here in New York—that New York is the first failed state.  

Maybe that would give him a little bit of a point.  But I…

 JOHN DONVAN 

Lawrence, I think he has got you on that one… 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

I really don’t think that that’s what it is.  Let me do a couple of 

things.  Berkeley is a great university.  Do you know what it costs 

to go to Berkeley a year?  Who knows?  30-plus thousand dollars 

a year. 

 WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

 Oh my. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

Is that a public university?  It’s owned by the public, but when 

you say “Find a better one than Berkeley…”  [LAUGHTER]  That’s 

not a public university.  The original act that created Berkeley… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

 [LAUGHS] 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

…you went to Berkeley free.  Free is public.  Free is the 

community.  30,000 dollars of after-tax money—per year—is not 

free.  That’s not… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

Bobby, that…  Bobby, that’s… 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

Just, just…  Can I make one other…? 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 44. 

 

 

 

 GRAY DAVIS 

Well, that isn’t right… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Well, let’s let Gray Davis comment. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

OK… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

The under…  The fees have gone up.  As governor, I opposed 

every fee.  But the fee to be an undergraduate in Berkeley this 

year is 10,000 dollars. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

OK.  Well then, I am wrong.  I read that it was… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

Undergraduate. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

… in the L.A. Times… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

The graduate schools… 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

…then it was lies… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

The graduate schools of Law and Business—for several years—

have been allowed to float up.  And they are—as Sharon 

suggested—25, 30 thousand dollars.  But Ph.D. candidates are

very low.  So it’s still a… it’s higher than it should be, but it’s still 

terrific compared to other alternatives available to students… 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

But when you have a student revolt for this… 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

Let me just stop for a second.  You do have a student revolt, but I 

just… 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

That’s true. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

…and I got the number from the L.A. Times, so…  And this is 

after the new editions, so maybe that’s wrong…  [LAUGHTER]  

Even to me, at 10 grand, it’s…  For a people who have modest 

incomes… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

I agree.  And I totally agree with you… 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

…10 grand of after-tax money… 

 GRAY DAVIS 

…that it’s not fair to them. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

…is a real thing.  The second thing is:  I think if you support—

which I do too—a constitutional convention, your…  When did 

people have constitutional conventions?  The National 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 46. 

 

 

 

Constitutional Convention was…when there was a big ol’ mess at 

hand.  You don’t have a constitutional convention when things 

are going great.   [LAUGHTER] So if you support…  [APPLAUSE]  

Right?  Right?  So if you support… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

All right, stop.  Well, let me…  And let me… 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

And let me, and let me, and let me just say.  If you support a 

constitutional convention—and I think you should ask all three of 

these gentlemen whether they support it or not—. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Uh-huh. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

—they have to lose, [LAUGHTER] because now you…  You don’t 

have… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Van Jones. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

…a constitutional convention… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

I would love to bring in Van Jones… 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

…in a successful—or a less than failed state—. 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 47. 

 

 

 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Van Jones is part of the weekend summit… 

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

Well, the rules change by the minute here… 

 VAN JONES 

Yeah.  Exactly.  Well…  First of all… 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

Oh yeah. 

 VAN JONES 

 …you are conceding the point—which is that we have, in 

California, the tools to continue to solve these problems.  One of 

the things that is so exciting about the State of California is that 

people who have ideas get a chance to actually act on them—

maybe to excess at this point.  And I would have no problem with 

rolling back some of the detritus as it accumulates on our 

constitution.  But we actually have the problem solvers, and the 

tools to solve the problems.  And when you say you have a failed 

state—which you are, and which you are suggesting.  First of all, 

you are trying to take off the table the economic successes.  The 

economic successes are a function—especially in the clean tech 

area—of policy successes, of political successes.  We have been 

able to put aside partisan differences on one question, which is:  

If we are going to have the jobs of tomorrow in California, we have 

got to have the technology of tomorrow…make the products of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 48. 

 

 

 

tomorrow…and we have been able to get that done.  And that sets 

the table for the forward motion that you are talking about.  So 

when you try and take off the table…  It’s striking to me.  I have 

never heard of a failed state where the eighth largest economy in 

the world…  I have never heard of a failed state that is literally 

one-eighth of the output for the entire country.  California is to 

the rest of the country what Germany is to the EU.  And I don’t 

hear anybody calling Germany a failed state, whatever problems 

they may be, that may be there.  And so I think again, you are 

conceding—when you talk about the fact that we are talking 

about a constitutional convention, and we are talking about a 

whole raft—that California forward and other folks are talking 

about a whole raft of fixes—we have got the tools and the 

innovation and the determination to fix the problems in 

California. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

So you are saying… 

 VAN JONES 

…and so we are not a failed state. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

So you are saying then that the existence of an ambulance team, 

means that the hospital is basically not shut down quite yet? 

 VAN JONES 

Well, [LAUGHS] well…  [LAUGHTER]  If you want to go with 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 49. 

 

 

 

that…  If you want to go with that analogy… I am saying that the 

patient is not dead. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

OK.  [LAUGHTER] 

 VAN JONES 

And  that’s what these guys are trying to do… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

But that’s…  I think that’s a valid… actually quite cogent 

argument.  Andreas, can you take that on? 

 ANDREAS KLUTH 

Sure.  So if you say [LAUGHTER], if you want to change it to 

California is dead…  And I can tell you we are not debating that, 

and we are not arguing it… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Yeah.  [LAUGHS] 

 ANDREAS KLUTH 

What we are…  By the way, I agree that failure—as you said—is 

an occasional stop.  I happen to be writing a book at the moment 

about how failure and success are imposters.  But you have to be 

honest that a failure has occurred, in order to fix it.  Californians 

are honest about it—that’s why they will pass the two initiatives 

that will call for a constitutional convention—just as Americans, 

after the Revolutionary War, called a constitutional convention 

because the Articles of Confederation were a failure, and they 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 50. 

 

 

 

accepted that and admitted that first, and then you start fresh.  

So you need to admit honestly that a failure has occurred…then 

you move on, move on. 

 

A few…  Just a little bit of mopping up.  About the public 

universities.  What is the still remaining excellence of the 

university system a sign of?  It’s a sign of the Pat Brown legacy, 

when California was not a failed state.  What are they 

dismantling?  I wrote a story about this.  I asked professors and 

the president of the UC system.  A professor at UC Santa Cruz of 

astrophysics told me…the excellence is being lost in her 

department as we speak because of the budget cuts.  The people 

she was hiring to be good professors have defected because they 

know there is nowhere for them to go in their careers.  They are 

going to more competitive, private or other public universities in 

the state and world.  So don’t get confused about this public 

university.  It was a sign of something working well 30 years 

ago…  And you are…  You will see—when it’s gone—that 

something failed today. 

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

And we will patiently await your naming of the state [LAUGHTER] 

that spends more on its university system. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

On a per-capita basis? 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

Spends more on its university system. 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

No, that’s…  [LAUGHTER]  Exactly. 

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

He kinda misses…  He kinda missed that… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

I want to go to the audience for questions now.  And again, raise 

your hand, I’ll find you.  A microphone to your mouth.  There is a 

woman I think in the gray sweater, right?  Yes, that’s right.  And 

ma’am, it’s easier for us—and so for the camera to see you—if 

you stand up… 

 WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

OK. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

And hold that mic close and make a good question… 

 WOMAN IN AUDIENCE 

Well, sure.  [LAUGHTER]  I am sorry?  No one here has raised, 

the issue of what was passed in 1979—and that was a 

proposition where basically, negated the state from raising any 

tax revenues to feed everything that you are talking about, 

whether it’s schools, public universities, services, art, what have 

you.  And I would ask Van Jones, let’s start with you.  Great that 

we have clean tech and we have the private industry and we have 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 52. 

 

 

 

capitalism and competition.  But if you don’t have the public 

monies to support initiatives, where do you get it?  Do you tax 

the capitalists? 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Question mark, very good.  Van Jones?  [APPLAUSE] 

 VAN JONES 

Well…  The problem in California isn’t primarily a revenue 

problem.  I mean, there are…  We had a courageous governor, 

frankly, who was willing to do what needed to be done with 

regard to the so-called car tax.  And the five billion dollars was on 

the table, and that’s off the table.  And we are the only state, in 

California…  The only oil producing state in the country that 

doesn’t tax the oil when it comes out of the ground.  It is a billion 

dollars a year…  There are revenue sources that are available.  

The problem in California right now is—which is why we are 

here—is that we haven’t agreed on the vision for California going 

forward. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Hmmm. 

 VAN JONES 

Now, a crisis of vision is an opportunity.  And that is…  Well, and 

that’s really, I think, what you are seeing in California.  People 

now—and a critical mass of people—are trying to figure out how 

we go forward…  I think obviously Prop 13, from my point of view, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 53. 

 

 

 

it has been disastrous for the State of California.  I think it’s not 

all taxes, but it is property taxes.  And what it’s done is, it has 

put the state on this yo-yo of tax income based on income tax 

and other sources of revenue…  We would have done better, I 

think, if we had a little bit more opportunity to have a property 

tax regime in place.  And also the other problem with Proposition 

13—which was raised—is that it would…it requires two-thirds of 

the legislature to agree to any tax increase.  And in California, 

that’s a very, very difficult thing to do given where the Republican 

Party is. 

 

But what I would say is simply this:  We have an abundance of 

opportunity in the State of California, because of the success of 

not just our clean energy—we brag on our clean tech because we 

are so proud of it—but we have nine different regional economies.  

Which gives us the ability to do what countries do, frankly.  We 

have an agricultural region…we have, manufacturing, etc.  And I 

think that where we are—at this stage in the development of 

California’s economy—is we will fix the tax structure, we will fix 

the budgeting structure.  And we have already got redistricting 

done.  And then, anybody who bets against California right now, 

is going to lose an awful lot of money. 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Another question?  And would you like to respond, to respond on 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

this side before I go to a question? 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

I would like, I would like to start…  

 JOHN DONVAN 

Oh, this is Sharon Waxman. 

 SHARON WAXMAN 

Oh yeah.  I would like to not respond…I would like to ask…  And 

clean tech is…  And we keep hearing clean tech, clean tech…  

How about the industry that I brought up—Hollywood—where 

that is, that is just the subject of the most egregious neglect in 

the years that I have been covering the industry.  This is a huge 

amount of money that the state has just allowed to leave.  And 

only this past year has there been the tiniest, too little too late 

measure to keep it together…by passing a small fraction of the 

kinds of measures that other states have already had in place for 

years to incentivize productions to stay in the state.  That’s 

money…  That’s not money that’s out there to be created, as 

clean tech is a future and building, an economy of where we are 

going…it’s an industry that’s there, that the state has allowed to 

slip through its fingers, and has never actually created a sense 

of—as I keep using that word—connection between the people…  

Yeah, how…?  I mean, California invented the motion picture 

industry.  It created…  It invented the entertainment industry.  

How is it possible that it has been allowed to slip away? 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 55. 

 

 

 

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

Well, that’s a very simple question.  And what Sharon is talking 

about… 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Lawrence ODonnell. 

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

…is what in California is referred to as runaway production.  A 

show like The West Wing, for example, was shot on a sound stage 

at Warner Brothers, and we would go to Washington a couple of 

times a year and pick up some exteriors.  Dick Wolf, who shoots 

Law and Order—the most successful show on television in terms 

of longevity and ratings—wanted higher production values than 

that, he wanted his cameras to be able to go on the streets of New 

York every day.  And where would you suggest shooting The 

Sopranos.  Do you think maybe we should do that on a back lot 

at Universal, you think we can just get the palm trees out of the 

way and give you the right feel, by moving The Sopranos out 

there?   What’s happened is the artists involved in this giant 

industry which is thriving, which has had its biggest box-office 

year of all time this year, in a recession, the artists are looking for 

higher production values and opportunities to shoot in places 

that were never available before.  You couldn’t shoot in Prague… 

25 years ago if you wanted to.

You can now—

That’s—

It has absolutely nothing to do with the management of the

 SHARON WAXMAN  

That’s absolutely false—   

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL  

—nothing—   

 SHARON WAXMAN  

—and you know it.  [LAUGHTER]  The taxes—   That’s completely 

empirically false.  Canada, London, 20 percent tax credits, it’s not 

the artists who make the decisions as you know, Dick Wolf is an 

exception, he’s not the artist in that case, he’s the executive 

producer.   But it’s the producers and it’s the people who sign the 

checks who decide where these jobs go.

years and, and I arrived…feeling very, very excited about the idea 

of direct democracy.   And it seems like we’re avoiding that topic 

because in—to my mind, it is the very prevalence of direct 

democracy that is ruining California and ruining California’s 

political system.  And—

I’m sorry.

I’m answering—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

I—I apologize, Gray Davis, I had a moderator lapse—   

 GRAY DAVIS 

And I—I can speak—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

I just want to ask you—

—with authority on direct democracy because I am a victim of it 

as well as a—  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]    

 JOHN DONVAN  

Can you—Governor, can you…can you take 10 seconds for the 

people who missed civics class that day…  [LAUGHTER]  10 

seconds—   

 GRAY DAVIS 

I can’t answer in—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

—to remind us of what direct democracy involved—   

 GRAY DAVIS 

Direct democracy in California basically means that, all issues 

get to the voters sooner or later, and if they don’t get to them 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 60. 

 

 

 

sooner the voters put an initiative on the ballot and take matters 

into their own hands.  And basically, everything of consequence 

gets decided by the voters.   And I think they make basically good 

decisions, I won an awful lot of elections, I lost my last election.  

But that doesn’t mean, people didn’t have a reason to want to 

change.  What it does mean, however, is they have the power, 

and I would suggest, in our system of special interests, the only 

people who have the power to improve things in Sacramento.   

They’ve already improved them, by changing the way legislators 

draw—legislators will never— no longer draw the districts, that 

means they will lose if they’re unresponsive going forward.  They 

can improve them further, with the passage of the open primary, 

which I assure you, the Republican party will oppose, the 

Democratic party will oppose, which oughta tell you how you 

should vote.  [LAUGHTER]   And on all major issues like the 

constitutional convention, the vote in November will just be to go 

out and come back to us with recommendations.  We don’t like 

the recommendations we will vote them down.   But we know the 

legislature, Republicans won’t allow taxes to increase, Democrats 

won’t allow cuts in major programs—they are immobilized, they 

can’t solve the problem, the only people who can solve the 

problem are the voters, who will I predict with the open primary, 

have already with reapportionment, and will I believe, give voters 

the opportunity to come back to us with recommendations,

hopefully to get away—get away with things like the two-thirds 

requirement to pass the budget.  But if they don’t come back with 

good ideas, then the voters will knock it down, so—    

 JOHN DONVAN 

[01:24:11:21] Andreas—   

 GRAY DAVIS  

—direct democracy can be a problem, but it also can be a saving 

grace.   

 JOHN DONVAN 

Andreas Kluth.   

 ANDREAS KLUTH  

First of all I have to say I agree exactly with you, you’ve—because 

you lived there and because you came from outside as I did you 

saw that direct democracy is a large part of the problem.  Part of 

it is confusion over the word democracy, James Madison didn’t 

want it even used in the constitution of the country, because he 

was afraid—they had studied ancient Athens which was a failure 

because of direct democracy.   They had studied Republican 

Rome, which was very stable, they wanted Rome, not Athens.  

Fast forward to a century ago, the Progressive era.   Californians 

and other western states introduced direct democracy because 

they were afraid of corruption by the Southern Pacific Railroad of 

the young state California, they wanted direct democracies, voter 

directly passing legislation, as a safeguard, as a fourth branch of 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

government to be used sparingly as in Switzerland which was 

their model.   Fast forward again to Prop 13, and onward, and 

you have a circus, earlier I said, an asylum that is run by the 

inmates.  Never mind the attack ads, the demagoguery…  Here is 

the word count of the longest initiative, 15,633 words.   That’s—it 

is, there was a, I remember driving in the car when several 

propositions were decided last year.  An English teacher called in 

and said she’s not able to understand the initiatives in the ballot 

on grounds of syntax.   That’s number one, people vote for double 

negatives when they think they’re voting for the triple negative.  

[LAUGHTER]  There is, it is in California…this is not a statement 

against representative democracy as the founding fathers of the 

nation said.   I’m—this is a statement against direct democracy 

as practiced in California, where the legislature is hobbled, 

because it cannot amend initiatives, and it is unique in that 

respect.  In California it is the least informed way of making 

decisions.   Other people have said tonight, it is curious how 

often the tough-on-crime voters vote for longer prison terms but 

forget the taxes to pay for larger prisons.  Vote for faster trains, 

for smaller school classes, for all these things and somehow 

forget, not only to vote for the taxes, but then also vote for Prop. 

13 so that they can’t even be raised.    

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

Taxes can be raised in California—

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 63. 

 

 

 

 JOHN DONVAN 

Lawrence ODonnell—   

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

—property taxes are the only taxes affected by Proposition 13 and 

what it tells you is how much they can be raised.   When 

Proposition 13 came along and said you know what, you’re sitting 

here, you’re living in your house, you might be on a fixed income, 

your house may have gone up in value dramatically over the 

years while you’re sitting in—living on that fixed income.   And 

now we cannot just come in and raise your property taxes 25 

percent next year, they put a limit in how much you could raise 

them.  Proposition 13 allows them to be raised, and the income 

tax, is sitting there, ready to be legislated at any time and the 

income tax is the fair way to fund government because it is based 

on your ability to pay.   Property taxes are not based on your 

ability to pay, and California does make a mistake in not raising 

its income taxes and making them more progressive, raising top-

end income taxes significantly, because,  those income taxes are 

deductible on federal income tax returns which means at the top 

rate, 50 percent of that money is actually being pulled out of 

what the federal government would’ve taken for taxation.   And 

you can, through a higher top-end income tax in California 

rebalance this relationship to the federal government’s take on 

California’s wealth.  Taxes can be raised—

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

I just want to make one small quibble, actually it’s a large 

quibble [LAUGHS] with Gray which is—he used the phrase, 

“Voters put these initiatives on the ballot.”  The real harsh truth 

I’m afraid is that voters do not put the initiatives on the ballot.  

There’s an—in fact a huge industry, which are in effect sort of 

semi-private legislatures…   You really have to think about that.  

There are people who are very well-financed, may not even live in 

California, who can hire teams of people, which is a business, a 

big business, to write legislation for the state.  They’ve had every 

conceivable, you all probably know, ridiculous things that have 

been put on and defeated.   And some ridiculous things have 

been passed because people as Andreas was saying, can’t figure 

out the syntax, I’m a lawyer, and I can’t figure out some of them,

the book that comes to you when you vote is that big, and you’re 

expected to read in very fine print those documents.   And the 

correlative to this idea is the deprofessionalization honestly of the 

legislature itself which is to some extent the function of the term 

limits law which is going to be extended—  

 ANDREAS KLUTH  

Passed by initiative.    

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

Indeed.  But the point there is that you have these permanent, 

semi-private, or entirely private groups of people, whose business 

it is every year, to make law for the state, who—    

 JOHN DONVAN 

So are you making the argument—   

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

No, and I want to say a second thing now that I hear Van’s dulcet 

tones.  We’re—  [LAUGHTER]  Switching gears a little bit to the—

for saying that the “first” point is a frivolous point which I entirely 

agree with.  What is a state if it’s not the creator of the vision of

ready to get up and walk because we win.

why a constitutional convention probably will pass and that’s 

why—  I mean, here’s the thing, that I always loved, was in the 

Declaration of Independence, not a constitutional convention but 

an important document nonetheless.  Everybody knows the first 

sentence.  Right?   “All men are created equal,” very few people 

remember the last sentence, which is, “To these truths we

think, Sacramento is not acting properly.  And to get the 

constitutional convention on the ballot, they have to get the 

signature of several hundred thousand Californians.  So people 

do put initiatives on the ballot.   Now is it a perfect system, no, 

and do we have a lot of shysters out there, misrepresenting 

what’s on the ballot, absolutely.  My, one of my…a sister of a dear 

friend of mine signed the recall petition against me.  And I said 

how could that be and she said because—

But people do put the initiatives on the ballot, people will solve 

the problem through the open primary and the constitutional 

convention, and I have great faith that Van will wisely use the 

remainder of our time.   

 VAN JONES 

Well, I just wanted to point out this is classic California.  Here 

you have the people who are saying, the ballot initiative is 

terrible, it’s awful, we’ve gotta get rid of it.  So we’re going to use 

the ballot initiative to get the constitutional convention that we 

want.   That’s exactly the beauty of the system that we have.  Is 

that we, in California we have big problems but we also have big 

tools to solve those problems.  And, I would, I’m shocked to

see some curtailment of some of the abuses of the initiative 

process but I think, in California we should be proud.  You say 

that people are ill-informed, et cetera, well that’s true about, you 

know, people going into the malls and making purchases.

 JOHN DONVAN  

I want to go to another que—also I want to point out that 

Lawrence ODonnell’s tactic of playing with the word “first” has 

been tried here before, we had a debate on whether George W. 

Bush was the worst President of the last 50 years, here in New 

York City.   Karl Rove spent the whole night talking about Jimmy 

Carter.  And he won the debate.  [LAUGHTER]  So whether it 

works tonight is up to you, one more question, just down, this 

gentleman, yeah, with the laser.    

 MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

I’d just like to ask both of you whether you think California will 

go bankrupt.  And if it does go bankrupt does that mean it’s a 

failed state.   

 JOHN DONVAN 

Great question.   

 GRAY DAVIS  

I’ll answer that—  

 JOHN DONVAN 

Gray Davis.   

 GRAY DAVIS  

I can say with no fear of contradiction that it won’t, because, it 

can’t.  It can’t legally go bankrupt but more importantly…  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 73. 

 

 

 

[LAUGHTER]  It’s technically true.  [LAUGHTER]  More 

importantly—  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]  it’ll work its way out of 

these problems and if you’re thinking of buying a California bond, 

I can assure you that the legislators understand the importance 

of lending to get them through these tough times.   Bonds come 

not after schools, the first dollar goes to schools, that comes in 

the door, the second dollar goes to pay GO bonds, the third 

dollar’s the school, the fourth dollar—  So as long as we have 

about 60 cents on the dollar in Sacramento we probably have 

about 85 to 95 percent extension now.  Your bonds are in good 

hands.  Buy California bonds.  [LAUGHTER]

Remember—because, it’s true, technically, legally a state cannot 

go bankrupt.   [01:35:25:18]   The order of payments is indeed 

correct.  Remember that California has the worst credit rating of 

the 50 states…that is a superlative.  It has just been lowered to 

one notch above junk, by the time this debate is over it probably 

is junk, so—  [LAUGHTER]   Even in the order of payments that 

you’ve just heard which was correct, it may indeed go, you know, 

the bonds may indeed default, which we don’t even need to prove, 

to carry our motion.

question is, “California is the First Failed State” and I’d like to 

focus the panel on the word “is.”   Are we being asked to decide 

whether California at eight p.m. on January 19th, 2010, is failed, 

now, or are we being asked to cast a vote on whether you think, 

the proposition is that California is now and will be irredeemably 

or for some time to come, a failure—

 SHARON WAXMAN  

No, I think, I—  [LAUGHTER]  Not at all, I—

 SHARON WAXMAN  

We’re clearly saying, from a position of people who live in 

California, who believe in California, who’ve spent—who have 

decided to spend our lives there, that California is currently a 

failed state, it makes me very sad to hear the other side of the 

panel…giving, paying truly lip service to the notion that yeah, it 

has some problems.   Talk—that’s about the understatement of 

this century, this early part of the century or the new decade.  If 

you live in California and you read the news every day, it is a 

litany of failures, rogue laws, gridlocks, budget…  Pick your 

billion, 20 billion this week, 30 billion last— three—six months 

ago, whatever the hole is that has to be filled, the latest service to 

be cut, the latest milk and cookies that will not be served.  It is—

this is the lives of the people of the state of California, it’s not a 

joke.  It’s not, how bad is New York or how bad is Arkansas.  It 

is—this is where we are spending our lives, and for us to be

arguing this, it is because we believe that California does hold the 

promise of being the greatest state in the nation, not because we 

believe it is irredeemably failed and cannot be saved.   But to 

hear people who are in our government, on the other side of, of 

the panel, suggesting that it’s all cheer, cheery and roses, is very 

disheartening I have to say for me as a resident of the state, the 

state is stuck.   And it is not working, and if you live there, and if 

you pay attention at all, you have to know that.

lotta love for Sharon Davis.  [LAUGHTER]   

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL  

As do we all.    

 SHARON WAXMAN 

 But you’ll still vote for our side—   

 GRAY DAVIS  

But here’s the point.  I think you can see it in your first sentence.  

We live in California.  We believe in California.  We know it will 

solve its problems and get better.  From 1998 to 2008, according 

to The Wall Street Journal two days ago, California’s economic 

growth was 25 percent, the rest—the national average was 16 

percent, that’s real after inflation adjustments.   Everywhere you 

look, people are doing their best to make this world a better place 

in California, and they’re doing it in other states as well.  We are 

doing the best we can, in a very difficult time.  I’m sure Sharon 

has noticed that there’s a national recession.   We have 10 

percent unemployment, there are problems all over America.  We 

are bigger than other states and the problems sometimes are 

bigger in California.  But they’re not too big for us to solve, and 

along the way, we are contributing enormous productivity and 

innovation to America.   And I suggest to you, as we get more 

global, we’re going to rely more and more on states that can 

innovate.  Because you can’t out-source an idea, until someone 

invents it.

we will hear brief statements, closing statements from each of the 

debaters in turn.  They’ll be two minutes each.  And this is their

State,” 31 percent of you agreed with the motion, you were for it, 

25 percent were against it, and 44 percent were undecided,  

you’ll be asked to vote again in a short, few minutes from now, 

but, on to Round 3, closing statements from each of the debaters 

in turn and speaking first, against the motion, Lawrence 

ODonnell, senior political analyst for MSNBC and former 

Democratic Chief of Staff of the US Senate Committee on 

Finance.    

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

First failed state—  

 JOHN DONVAN 

Oh, Lawrence, you can—the—we sit on all of these.   

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

Okay, sorry—

 JOHN DONVAN 

Sure, no problem.   

 LAWRENCE ODONNELL 

I thought…I’m sorry, I’m from the state where words matter.  

[LAUGHTER]  Same with you.  So some people have doubts about 

what does “is” mean, that’s a familiar question.  Some people 

have doubts that “first” should be in here which is to say, it’s 

allowable then if we drop “first” that there are other states doing 

things much worse than the California government is doing 

things.   In the fiscal years that cover this current recession, 

2009 through the 2010 fiscal years, states have faced $256 

billion in budget gaps…nationwide, $256 billion.  They’ve solved 

$73.1 billion of those budget gaps so far.  They have a lot of work 

to do to close those gaps, this is one of those states, where we sit 

right now.  Now, California, in its riches, just like New York in its 

riches, has been generous.  It has a Medicaid formula that is 

more generous than other states.   If you’re on Medicaid in 

California you get more benefits at a higher level of income, the 

high—the income cutoff is a higher level than in these other 

states.  And so if you want to say to Alabama, go ahead, 

Alabama, keep it up…   Keep it up, don’t let people have 

Medicaid—or if they make as much as $15,000 a year for a family 

of four, don’t let them have it.  If you want to vote that way, and 

say, I’m going to penalize the state that has tried and in its 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

trying, has to struggle then in this anti-tax environment in this 

country of raising the money to pay for what it has promised,  

and then ends up in this very difficult fight every year about how 

do we balance this budget that doesn’t seem to be balanceable—

which is exactly what happens in this state every year, exactly 

what happens.   If you want to penalize those governments, those 

liberal governments over generations of liberal advance in social 

programs, for overfunding health care for the poor if you want to 

call it that, because now it has to be cut back, or overfunding 

public education because now it has to be cut back under these 

burdens that they face today, then go ahead.  Penalize those 

states.  Declare here tonight, that Alabama has done a better job 

than California—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Lawrence ODonnell, your time is up, thank you very much.  

[APPLAUSE]  Our motion, “California is the First Failed State,” 

summarizing his position in favor of this motion, The Economist’s 

West Coast correspondent, Andreas Kluth.   

 ANDREAS KLUTH  

I don’t want to summarize it because, I don’t think I need to, I 

want to say thank you to you, sir, for focusing our, our attention 

again on the proposition that you’re now deciding in this binary 

way, “California is the First Failed State,” you wanted me to focus 

on “is” and “first.”   California is the first failed—failed state 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 82. 

 

 

 

means simply that tonight as we speak it is a failure.  It does not 

mean that, five years from now, it cannot have made a fresh 

start.  In fact, the most important prerequisite for making a fresh 

start and insuring, just as it came up earlier-- in Pat Brown’s 

day, California was not a failure, today it is.   Things can change, 

however, you have to take a a vital step first.  You have to admit 

that something has failed for you to change it.  This is sort of a 

microcosm of two organizations in California, one called 

California Forward, one called Repair California.   The names will 

tell you nothing what they stand for, one wants to deny that the 

failure is fundamental and wants to fiddle, wants to fiddle here, 

fiddle there, muddle along, and hope that it’ll get better, the other 

is Repair California which is the organization now pushing the 

initiatives for the constitutional convention.   They want you to 

say that the failure is fundamental, and therefore we need a new 

constitution because ours is unmanageably complex, with 500 

amendments…in half the time that it took America’s constitution 

to have 27 amendments, all because of initiatives.   The people of 

California will pass those initiatives calling for a constitutional 

convention…in any poll, opinion poll that you may now read.  

And that is because the people of California take it for granted, 

they just assume, there is a consensus that the failure is as of 

today, in fact there, that California has failed, and that we must 

start fresh with a new constitution, to prevent it, finally, “first”

simply means, the other states, the other 49 have to watch out so 

they don’t repeat our mistakes.   

 JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Andreas Kluth.  [APPLAUSE]  Making his 

summarizing statement against the motion that “California is the 

First Failed State,” Van Jones, former White House Special 

Advisor for Green Jobs and co-founder of the Ella Baker Center 

for Human Rights and Green for All.   

 VAN JONES 

Well, first of all I just want to say, I do think that the question is 

properly stated about the present moment.  I want to say that, 

it’s been posed that if you don’t believe that we are in …sub… 

collapse, that we don’t care about the people who are suffering in 

California, that’s not true.   People are suffering in California 

right now.  There are people who are suffering in prisons, way too 

many people, we’re spending way too much money, they have 

way too little hope and way too little help when they get out.  But, 

I also know that we have great ideas, we have people throughout 

the state of California moving restorative justice ideas to fix that.  

Even the governor now says maybe we should make it 

unconstitutional to spend so much money on prisons, more than 

we spend on our four-year colleges and universities.   When you 

are looking at how you evaluate any situation in your own life, 

you look at your problems, you look at your deficits, but you also 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 84. 

 

 

 

look at your assets.  And as long as you are breathing, as long as 

you have the ability to confront your problems, you’re not a 

failure.   And, I’m going to say, anybody in this room going 

through anything, you’re not a failure, until you quit.  People in 

California have not quit, we are moving forward, we are coming 

together in ways that are extraordinary, and we will solve these 

problems.   And I ask you to vote to support us, to encourage us 

and say, that we’re not failures, you’re not failures, this country 

is not a failure, we have problems that we have to solve and we 

will solve them together.    

 JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Van Jones.  [APPLAUSE]  Making her summarizing 

statement for our motion, “California is the First Failed State,” 

Sharon Waxman, editor-in-chief of The Wrap.com, an 

entertainment and media business news source.   

 SHARON WAXMAN  

Well, I believe the other side has actually made our point this 

evening.  They’ve said that California is full of innovative people, 

it’s full of ideas, its culture is rich, that invention is still vibrant 

in the state and the lifestyle is beautiful.  All of that is true and 

that’s why we all choose to live there.   But all of that is despite 

the fact that the state has failed.  And it’s not bec—and we stay 

there for all those reasons because, we continue to push forward, 

but not because the state lends a hand, plays its role in providing 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”

education, transportation, security, a prison system, a medical 

system, the things that are the state.   That is what we’re here to 

talk about tonight, it is a very serious matter for those of us who 

live and who have engaged our lives in the state.  And to hear 

Van say that we are coming together in ways that are 

extraordinary, it sounds really lovely, I have no idea what that 

means.  [LAUGHTER]   We’re not coming together, and there’s 

nothing extraordinary about what’s happening to California as a 

state except extraordinarily bad, I’m sad to say.  So I ask you all 

to vote for this proposition as a gesture, of not only that we have 

proved the case, but as a gesture of helping take the step of 

consciousness, and of moving California toward the right future, 

which is not the path that it’s on.    

 JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Sharon Waxman.  [APPLAUSE]  The motion is, 

“California is the First Failed State,” and summarizing his 

position against the motion, Gray Davis, the 37th governor of 

California, also served as Lieutenant Governor, State Controller, 

and State Assemblyman.   

 GRAY DAVIS  

I want you to vote against the proposition, because the 

proposition is what it purports to be, California…supposedly is 

the first failed state.  By any measure, we are more generous 

than virtually any other state, I was proud to provide health care

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 86. 

 

 

 

to 900,000 youngsters that didn’t have it when I became 

governor.   Occasionally there’s talk that maybe we have to 

reduce that by a little bit.  I don’t like it, but we’re living in tough 

times.  As Mr. ODonnell said, we’re more generous in our 

Calworks program, we have our own separate welfare program to 

tag onto what the federal government does.   We’re more 

generous on our health care programs, we supplement what the 

federal government does.  So sometimes in tough times, we’re not 

able to do all the things we would like to do.  But we’re not sitting 

around moaning and groaning.   We’re solving our problems, the 

people are taking matters into their own hands, I’m confident 

that they will adopt an open primary, I’m confident that they will 

give voters the chance to go out and make recommendations to 

change…what’s happening…because of the shortcomings of 121 

people in Sacramento.   But I just want to assure you that you’re 

going to be in very good company if you vote no, Time magazine 

would have you vote no.  Wall Street Journal two days ago said, 

California, failed state, it’s such a big subsidizer of the other 

states that are in trouble in this country, it oughta secede.  Now I 

don’t want us to secede because I don’t think we’re in great 

shape today.  But we’re on our way to being in great shape again, 

and we’re going to be a very important part of America, going 

forward in our global economy.   So I would ask you to look at the 

proposition and say to yourself, California’s doing a lot of things

better than most other states, I’m not going to say it is the first 

failed state in America.  Please vote no, which I think is number 2 

on your list.  [LAUGHTER]    

 JOHN DONVAN  

Very good, Gray Davis, thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Our final 

speaker, summarizing for the motion that “California is the First 

Failed State,” Bobby Shriver, Santa Monica city councilman, and 

co-founder of One.org and Red.   

 BOBBY SHRIVER 

Thank you.  I also appreciated the “is” question.  Because, and I 

appreciate also Sharon’s seriousness about this matter, I mean 

we’ve had a little fun, which is great.  But the truth is tonight, at 

this moment, people are suffering in really unimaginable ways, 

and this is a pretty wealthy crowd, a powerful crowd, we’re here 

in New York, it’s all good.   The people that the government and 

the sense of political compassion is created to serve are really, 

really bad in California.  Calworks that Gray mentioned’s about 

to be defunded entirely.  The reason that we have a lot of 

homeless in people is not because LA is big as Lawrence 

suggested.   It’s because the policies of the state, don’t work.  

Mental health financing is with the county, housing is with the 

city.  They don’t work together, they haven’t worked.  There’s 

been no progress made, enormous progress has actually been 

made in New York, on homelessness.  Despite what other things 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “California is the First Failed State” (1/19/10) Page 88. 

 

 

 

New York hasn’t done well.   I want to reiterate, we’re the 

optimistic people, we’re not moaning and groaning.  We’re not, 

oh, woe is us, California doesn’t have a lot of brilliant people, a 

lot of venture capital, a lot of cool companies, we acknowledge all 

that.   We’re not talking about that, we’re talking about the state 

which is a revenue-collection mechanism.  It disperses money to 

people, to do things that the community wants done.  If that isn’t 

happening, the state, not the people, not our energy, not our 

optimism, not our tools, none of that, is relevant.   It’s a revenue-

collection thing based on principles.  We are not collecting and 

distributing the revenue to the most vulnerable people in the 

state today by an immense margin.  The suffering…here, is 

immense.  And that’s  why you have to vote, to give a wake-up 

call, to the people who hold the power in the state and the people 

of California, so that they can feel comfortable to say you know 

what, we’re optimistic, we’re going to get it done, but we got a 

problem.    

 JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Bobby Shriver, and that concludes Round 3 of our 

debate.  [APPLAUSE]  And now it’s time to find out who our 

winners are, you in the audience will choose our winners, I’m 

going to ask you to go again to the keypad on the right arm of 

your seat, at each seat you will register your vote.   And we will 

get the read-out instantaneously, practically.  Vote number 1 if

you are for—our motion is “California is the First Failed State,” 

vote number 1, push number 1 if you are for the motion.  Push 

number 2 if you are against the motion, and number 3 if you 

remain undecided—   

GRAY DAVIS  

[INAUDIBLE, VOICE OFF-MIC]  We’d like ‘em all to stand, 

because they’re New Yorkers.  [LAUGHTER]  New Yorkers, they 

get to vote.    

 JOHN DONVAN  

You know, I just want to thank this panel for the level of game 

they brought to this debate, they really put the intelligence in 

Intelligence Squared.  It was really excellent.  [APPLAUSE]  And 

also you in the audience, your questions were excellent tonight.   

But before I announce the results of the vote which I’ll have in 

just a minute, a few things to take care of, our next debate will be 

on Tuesday, February 9th, our motion is, “The US Should Step 

Back from its Special Relationship with Israel.”   Panelists for the 

motion are New York Times columnist Roger Cohen and Columbia 

University professor Rashid Khalidi, against the motion are 

Ambassador Stuart Eisenstadt who served under both Presidents 

Carter and Clinton, and Israel’s former ambassador to the US, 

Itamar Rabinovich.   Individual tickets are still available for that 

one by visiting our website and also at the Skirball box office 

outside.  And you can follow, join, become a fan of Intelligence

upcoming debates.   All of our debates as you know because 

we’ve talked about it tonight can be heard on NPR stations, now 

on more than 200 stations across the nation.  I guess they’re 

going to have to edit around that dating thing that you did, but 

they can work.   You can also watch the spring debates on the 

Bloomberg Television Network, airdates and times can be found 

in your program.  And also don’t forget to read about tonight’s 

debate in next week’s edition of Newsweek, and there are copies 

in the library that you can pick up on your way out.   So, now the 

results are in, they’ve just been handed to me, and remember the 

team that changes the most minds is the team that is declared 

the winner.  Now our motion is, “California is the First Failed 

State,” when you voted before the debate, 31 percent of you were 

for the motion, 25 percent against, and 44 percent undecided.   

After the debate, 58 percent are for the motion, 37 percent 

against, and 5 percent undecided.  [APPLAUSE]  The team for the 

motion, wins our debate, thank you very much to all of our 

panelists, to you in our audience, from me, John Donvan, thank 

you from Intelligence Squared US.
