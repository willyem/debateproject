John Donvan: 
And now I'd like to introduce, to set up and frame the debate, the chairman of the 
board of Intelligence Squared U.S., Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. 
 
[applause] 
 
Robert Rosenkranz: 
Well, thank you and welcome.  You know, my own experience of college football 
consisted of attending occasional games at Yale Bowl.  When I was lucky enough to have 
a date, she usually knew more about the game than I did.  I was a bright, nerdy kid.  And 
when I got into a position to hire people, I looked to hire people like myself.  But with 
maturity and experience, I came to value a varsity football background very highly 
indeed.  Often that bespoke the discipline to work very hard, the perseverance to suffer 
defeat and endure pain, the personality to be part of a team and sometimes the 
charisma to lead one.   
 
18:45:48 
 
A healthy mind and a healthy body.  What's wrong with that ideal?  Well, nothing, 
except it has very little to do with college football as played at the big state colleges, the

Texas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan and the recently infamous Penn State.  
These are big businesses.  They generate profits of 40 to $50 million a year, sometimes 
more.  The coaches are paid more than university presidents.  And the athletes are 
offered all manner of tawdry inducements, often making a sham of their amateur 
status.  They can emerge with little real education, but often with some very real brain 
injuries resulting in elevated risks of dementia at a young age.   
 
18:46:41 
 
Libertarians would argue that all sorts of sports and recreational activities are risky; 
motor car racing, downhill skiing, climbing mountains and on and on.  And a decent 
respect for human liberty dictates allowing adults to assume the risks they choose.  But 
query if a small -- if a poor high school student offered an athletic scholarship to play 
big-time football is making an informed choice or a mature one.  And for the colleges, is 
big-time football a valuable source of funding for other athletic programs?  Is it an 
object of school pride that drives bigger donations from alumni and more generous 
funding from state legislatures?  Or is it a corruption magnet, corrosive with the 
meaning and purpose of the university itself. Clearly, there's a huge public interest in 
these issues.   
 
18:47:41 
 
We've rarely had a debate that was sold out so quickly or that garnered so much pre-
debate publicity.  So let the game begin. Panelists, John, over to you. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you very much. 
 
[applause] 
 
And I'd like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Yes or no to this statement, "Ban college football," and jaws drop all over.  Yes, we are 
talking about that time-honored sport, football in the place where it first mattered, 
college. And we are talking about banning it.  Welcome to Intelligence Squared U.S.  I'm 
John Donvan.  We have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two.  And for a 
taste of the kind of poetry and passion and pain that comes to bear when we discuss the 
meaning of football, I just want to give you a taste, a sample of what one NFL player 
wrote back in 2001 about playing through pain.

He said, "To this day, I will encourage people to feel the knob below my neck where the 
collarbone was sprung free from my sternum in the middle of a game against the 49ers. 
That was pain."  And he loved it.  So are we talking about madness, or are we talking 
about courage when we debate the question of banning college football.  Let's meet our 
debaters. On the side arguing for the motion to ban college football, Buzz Bissinger, a 
Pulitzer prize-winning writer and author of the book, "Friday Night Lights."  His partner 
is Malcolm Gladwell, a staff writer at the New Yorker and author of four best-sellers, 
among them "The Tipping Point."  Arguing against the motion, arguing not to ban 
college football, Tim Green, a college football hall-of-famer and former Atlanta Falcons 
defensive end. 
 
18:49:48 
 
And his partner, Jason Whitlock of foxsports.com, national columnist and former 
offensive tackle for Ball State University.  Our motion is, "Ban college football."  Let's 
talk to our debaters.  Let's talk to our debaters.  First, Buzz Bissinger.  And Buzz, in 1990, 
you wrote a book called "Friday Night Lights."  It is considered a classic of sports 
journalism about a small town, Odessa, Texas, and the trials of its high school team.  It is 
considered by Sports Illustrated the fourth greatest sports book of all time.   
 
18:50:45 
 
A movie came from it, a television show.  And you have said that you, while critical of 
what you saw, you have said that you love the sport and that violence is why we like it.  
So are you on the wrong team here? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Well, I don't think so.  I think violence is why we like it.  And, look, nobody has ever 
accused me of being consistent about anything.  I also think there's a vast distinction 
between what we're arguing here, which is college football versus pro players who are 
being compensated very, very well for what they do and know the risks going in.  
College players receive nothing beyond a scholarship that is really of questionable value 
because of the demands placed upon them.  So I think what I've said is very consistent. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, Buzz Bissinger, let's meet your debating partner, Malcolm Gladwell.  Malcolm 
Gladwell who can't seem to help but writing best-selling books, "Blink,"  "Outliers," "The 
Tipping Point."   
 
18:51:41 
 
In the New Yorker, you've written about everything from innovation to ketchup to social 
media and, of course, your piece that helped inspire this debate, the one where you 
compared college football to dog fighting.  You're also Canadian.

Canada has football.  Is it any different in Canada? 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Well, the difference in Canada is that we don't care about football. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Malcolm Gladwell.  Our motion is "ban college football."  And here to meet 
the team arguing against the motion in support of college football, Tim Green.  Now, I, 
earlier in the program, read a quote from somebody who said, "Come touch the knob 
on my neck." And that was you, Tim Green.  And we're all going to line up and do that 
afterwards, but -- this paean to punishment you wrote. 
 
Male Speaker: 
I'm not touching his mouth. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
I -- I -- 
 
Tim Green: 
You're going to go there already?  Come on, we've got to have some class on this side of 
the auditorium. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jason, I totally deliberately stayed away from that line myself.   
 
18:52:42 
 
So this paean to punishment that you wrote, what is that about?  Why -- why the glory 
of the pain? 
 
Tim Green: 
It's how much can you take, how much can you take and keep going?  And I think that's 
one of the great lessons of the sport of football, and I think that's why it's great for our 
youth.  It's great in little league.  It's great in high school.  It's certainly great in college 
because it teaches kids that life is tough.  Things are tough.  And then you pick yourself 
up, and you go on.  I think it's the greatest lesson in the game, and I think it's the 
greatest game that we play.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Tim Green.  And let's meet your debating partner arguing against banning 
college football, Jason Whitlock.  And Jason, you are also a former player.  You were an 
all-state offensive lineman in high school and an offensive tackle at Ball State University 
where you got a degree in journalism.  You are on record, Jason, as saying that you are 
in favor of paying college players to play the game.  So if you were given the choice 
nowadays back at Ball State, would you play for free? 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
If we were playing back in the '80s, early '90s when I played, absolutely, because I 
thought the exchange was fair then.   
 
18:53:48 
 
Coaches and football wasn't generating as much money.  And I was prepared to take 
advantage of the currency that they were paying me in education.  Not all of my 
teammates were.  So yeah, I would do it all again. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Thank you, Jason Whitlock.  Ladies and gentlemen, our debaters.  So this is a 
contest.  And in this debate, one team will win.  The other team will lose.  And, our live 
audience, will choose our winners by your vote.  Let's go to the first round of voting 
now. The keypad at your seat will register where you stand on this motion at this point 
as you come in off the street.  The motion is "ban college football."  And if you agree 
with the motion, press number one.  And if you disagree with the motion, number two.  
And if you're undecided, push number 3.  And at the end of the debate we will have you 
vote a second time and at that point we will reveal the results of both numbers and the 
team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner.   
 
18:54:48 
 
So we go in three rounds.  The first round is uninterrupted statements by each debater 
in turn.  They are seven minutes each.  So on to round one.  And speaking first for the 
motion, "Ban college football," like to introduce Malcolm Gladwell.  He is a New Yorker 
staff writer. And, Malcolm, you can make your way to that lectern.  Malcolm Gladwell is 
a New Yorker staff writer, chronicler of the counterintuitive, and author of "Outliers 
Blink" and "The Tipping Point."  Ladies and gentlemen, Malcolm Gladwell.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Thank you.  I should say before we start that I haven't debated since college and that 
was many years ago.  And that was in Canada, and in Canada a debate isn't really a 
debate, it's simply an alternate mechanism of reaching consensus. 
 
[laughter] 
 
So this is all very new and exciting for me.  I want to make one thing clear before we 
start and that is that this is not a debate about banning football nor is it a debate about 
whether there are merits to playing football.   
 
18:55:50 
 
You will hear I'm quite sure from Mr. Green and Mr. Whitlock that all kinds of wonderful 
things happen when you play football, you learn camaraderie and discipline and 
teamwork. All of those things are true, and neither Buzz nor I are going to dispute any of 
them.  This debate is about a very specific question.  Right now in colleges across the 
country schools field football teams for the purpose of offering recreation to the players 
and offering entertainment to fans and students and alumni.  And the question is, is that 
appropriate. Buzz is going to say, "That's not appropriate because the players are 
exploited," and I'm going to say that, "It's not appropriate because schools should not 
be in the business of encouraging young men to hit themselves over the head."  Let's 
talk a little bit about hitting over the head.  Start with a very simple -- the simple physics 
of football.   
 
18:56:42 
 
The human brain is a mass of soft tissue that is suspended within a hard skull, right?  
Every time you get hit, that soft tissue rattles around inside your skull.  And the effect of 
that rattling around is to stretch and sometimes tear the connections between your 
nerve cells. In the course of everyday life, that almost never happens.  In the course of 
playing football, that happens all the time.  It is not unusual in the course of a game for 
a player to sustain hits to the head of between 40 and 100 Gs.  To put that in 
perspective, if you were to get in your car and not put on your seatbelt and drive at 25 
miles an hour into a brick wall so that your forehead struck the dashboard of the car, 
that would be a hit of 100 Gs, right?  If you reversed your car and went and did it over 
and over again so that you hit the brick wall 30 to 40 times at speeds between 20 and 25 
miles an hour, that would be the equivalent of a football game.  If you reversed your car 
and over the course of the next three months drove it at 25 miles an hour into a brick 
wall 1,000 times, that would be the equivalent of a college football season.   
 
18:57:50 
 
Now, you're going to hear from Mr. Whitlock and Mr. Green, they're going to try and tell 
you that there are ways around this fact, that if we have better rules or better 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

treatment of concussions or better helmets, the effect of that kind of injury can be 
minimized.  That is a fantasy.  There are ways to cut down on the number of 
concussions, but concussions are only a small part of the problem.  The real issue is all of 
those thousands of tiny hits.  There isn't a helmet in the world that can be designed that 
can take the sting out of those hits, and there is no way to play this game of football and 
remove those hits without turning tackle football into touch football, and the last I 
checked this was not a debate about whether we should ban touch football on college 
campuses.  I once watched a football practice at the University of North Carolina where 
the players were playing without pads; they were just doing a simple scrimmage.   
 
18:58:44 
 
In the course of 20 minutes, one of their running backs sustained hits to the head of 79, 
60, and 30 Gs.  In 15 minutes, he had the equivalent of three car accidents.  Now, what's 
the effect of all of that neurological trauma?  Well, we know.  It's a condition called, 
"CTE," which brings about premature death and the equivalent of Alzheimer's in people 
who are as young as 40 years old.  I've seen pictures of the brain scans of people with 
CTE and it looks like someone drove a truck across their brain.  Now, we don't know how 
many ex-football players have this condition because you can't diagnose it until they die, 
until you do an autopsy of your brain, but there are people who estimate there are as 
many as 20 percent of football players who have this condition.  And we also know that 
there are players as young as 18 years old who have been diagnosed with CTE.  It’s a 
problem that begins in high school and is made worse during college.   
 
18:59:40 
 
Now, I have no problem whatsoever with grown men in full possession of the facts and 
risks of the game choosing to participate in a potentially lethal profession, right?  I have 
no problem with people who smoke cigarettes, I have no problem with people who do 
deep sea diving, I have no problem with people who want to drive their motorcycle 
without a helmet on.  If you want to play Russian roulette with your brain, fine.  But 
college is a very, very different matter.  Every single college in this country, rich or poor, 
big or small, is supported by the taxpayer dollars of the people in this room.  They are 
subsidized by us, they are given immunity from taxes, they are supported by laws of 
Congress, by acts of local legislatures.  They are in every way funded by the people in 
this room.  And the reason for that special relationship between us and the world of 
higher education is that they are charged with a sacred trust, and that is to prepare the 
minds of young men and women to lead lives -- the minds of young -- to lead productive 
lives as full citizens of the United States.

And nowhere, nowhere, in that social contract does it say that it’s okay to promote and 
encourage young men to hit themselves over and over again in the head in the name of 
entertainment.  Thank you. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Malcolm Gladwell.  Our motion is "ban college football," and here to speak 
against the motion, Tim Green.  He’s a college football hall of famer, a former Atlanta 
Falcons defensive end, a lawyer, the author of 26 books.  He has been called the 
renaissance man of sports by both Sports Illustrated and The LA Times.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, Tim Green. 
 
Tim Green: 
Thank you.  Can I have the two minutes Malcolm didn’t use?  Okay.  When I was first 
asked to do this, I -- of course I asked permission from my wife, as any good husband 
will, and when she said, “Well, you know, what’s the debate?”  
 
19:01:46 
 
I said, “Ban college football or not.”  She said, “Well, that’s ludicrous.  You know, you’ll 
win that debate.”  I said, “Yeah.”  She said, “You can win the debate, can’t you?”  I said, 
“Absolutely.”  She said, “Well, who are you debating?”  I said, “Buzz Bissinger, Malcolm 
Gladwell.”  She said, “You’ve had too many concussions.” 
 
[laughter] 
 
And I have.  And I have.  And I agree with our opponents, Mr. Gladwell and Mr. 
Bissinger, in a lot of ways.  Football is a brutal game and I have grave concerns about 
concussions and the impact of concussions.  I also agree that I think college football 
players, because of the revenues that they generate, should be paid I think a small 
stipend.  I think that they deserve that. 
 
[applause] 
 
And so in some ways I do agree with them.  But banning college football -- I mean, so I 
had to first -- I had to get over my initial horror at the notion because, of course, football 
for me has done a lot of tremendous things.   
 
19:02:50 
 
And then I looked at, you know, just our country, our society in general, and I thought 
about football and what it does in the colleges and how it’s a unifier.  Not just the guys 
on the teams, not just unifying people from different places and different ethnicities and 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

different religions into one solid unit that learns to work together, but unifying a 
campus, unifying the students, unifying the faculty, unifying the alumni, unifying 
sometimes entire towns, communities, and whole cities.  And so, in that respect, to me, 
I said, you know, “How could we?  How could we ban” -- college football is a wonderful 
thing.  But then I wanted to look at it and I wanted to look at the numbers, because 
obviously my opponents are highly intelligent men, they’re passionate men, they’re very 
learned, and I said, you know, “What is it?  What’s behind this?”   
 
19:03:45 
 
And so I looked into the numbers as far as what does college football -- what are the 
benefits of college football and what are the detriments?  Well, the detriments certainly 
are the head injuries.  Now, I’ve got to say this because we’ve got to get things straight 
from the beginning about the concussions and the g-forces, because Mr. Gladwell talked 
about 100 g-forces when you hit your head into a brick wall at 25 miles an hour 30 times 
a game.  That does not happen in a college football game.  That does not happen in an 
NFL football game because when you get hit at 120 -- at 100 Gs, you get a concussion, 
and when you get a concussion, now more than ever, you are taken out of the game and 
you are put into some rehab program.  Now, back when I played, back when Jason 
played, it wasn't like that.  It was -- do you know where you are?  No.  How many fingers 
do I have up?  Four.  Okay. That's close enough.  You're ready to go back in.   
 
19:04:44 
 
It's not like that anymore.  And so the game is evolving to become safer and safer, as 
safe as it can be.  But it will never be completely safe.  It won't be completely safe.  So 
what I said to myself is, well, let me look at some things that are maybe as unsafe or 
maybe even more unsafe than playing the game of football.  And so, of course, 
automobile accidents came to mind because the mortality rate is about a hundred times 
higher for men in that age range that they're going to die in an automobile accident 
than they're going to die on the football field.  And then I said, well, look, how about -- 
how about going out and riding your bicycle?  That's right.  That's more dangerous, or 
downhill skiing.  And then I said, well, let me look at sports.  And so I went to the NCAA, 
and I looked at their sports, and I looked at a study that was done at the University of 
North Carolina.  I looked at the study of the fatalities, direct fatalities and the sports that 
are more dangerous than football.  Equestrian riding, female downhill skiing, lacrosse, 
water polo and baseball.   
 
19:05:48 
 
And then I went to indirect fatalities, and I looked, and I found that rowing, basketball, 
skiing, water polo and swimming are all more dangerous than football.  And so if we're 
going to say, well, football has to be banned, then I think it's only right that we pretty 
much have to ban all college sports if we're going to do it based on the risks and the 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

safety.  The other thing that I just have to disagree with, with Mr. Gladwell -- and I know 
this is dangerous territory for me -- but he talked about grown men. And to suggest that 
college football players at the age of 18, 19, 20, 21 are not grown men, it's -- that's just 
not true because we'll take 18, 19, 20-year-olds, and we'll send them off to Afghanistan 
or wherever in the world we need them to help protect our country.  And those are 
grown men.  And so at the age of, you know, majority, at 18, I think that they have the -- 
they have the right to make that decision.   
 
19:06:46 
 
So those are the things that are maybe against.  And I don't think that it's that 
dangerous. What are the things that are for?  Education.  Mr. Bissinger said, well, you 
know, all you get is a scholarship.  All you get is a scholarship?  If you go to my alma 
mater, that's a $250,000 plus scholarship.  That's the value of that education.  So you do 
get an education.  How many scholarship football players are there in this country every 
year?  23,000.  And the surplus from the game of football is used for what?  Well, maybe 
it is for research, maybe it is for physical [unintelligible], but a lot of it is also used for 
Title 9, for opportunities for women athletes to enjoy scholarships and enjoy educations 
that they might never have had before.  And to suggest that football and sports aren't 
educating, especially football, aren't educating students, I looked at that too.  In the 
general population, students have a graduation rate of 55 percent in this country, and 
it's going down.   
 
19:07:47 
 
It's of grave concern.  NFL -- college football players in the last 25 years have gone from 
a 60 percent graduation rate to a 70 percent graduation rate.  So not only are they being 
educated, they're being educated at a higher and better rate than their peers.  For me, 
the game of football -- and I -- well, I was serious about the lessons of football on an 
individual basis of teamwork, hard work, perseverance and tolerance.  And I know my 
partner, Jason is going to talk more about that when he has his turn.  Those are 
wonderful lessons that, for me, were an education in and of themselves.  So I hope that 
you will all vote tonight to not ban college football.  Thank you.

Thank you, Tim Green.  And here's a reminder of where we are.  We are halfway

19:08:43 
 
We have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion, "Ban college 
football."  You have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

debating in support of the motion, "Ban college football," Buzz Bissinger.  He is a winner 
of the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting and author of several bestsellers, 
including "Friday Night Lights," his newest book is called "Father's Day."  It's due out on 
Sunday.  Ladies and gentlemen, Buzz Bissinger. 
 
[applause] 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Thank you.  You know, it seems to me that given that this debate is taking place at a 
university that is one of the greatest and most innovative in the country that doesn't 
have football, I think this debate ends right now.  Our nation is at a cornerstone.  There's 
no doubt about it.  We are questioning everything, tax rate, rich versus poor, who are 
we? What are we?  In a very intense— the most competitive global economy we have 
ever faced.   
 
19:09:44 
 
And one of the things that we are looking at and must look at which makes this debate 
pertinent is the role of the university.  It is pivotal.  Questions over course offerings, 
allocation of resources in a very difficult era as governors are slashing to the bone, 
dwindling money, rising tuition.  And yet, a recent book by two sociologists, Richard 
Arum and Josipa Roksa says that basically undergraduates embrace college life, and it is 
shaped and oriented to nonacademic endeavors.  The amount of study time has gone -- 
and this was by two labor economists. Study time in colleges has gone from over 40 
hours in the 1960s to 20 hours in the 1980s to currently 13 hours of study time.  And I 
believe that at the top of what has become the university distraction, the distracted 
university is football, is football.   
 
19:10:51 
 
It sucks all the air out of the room.  The amount of money that coaches make is 
insulting.  It is insulting when a coach is making five to 10 to 15 times more than a 
college president. What does it say?  What does it say about the priorities of a 
university?  It says that the head coach runs the school.  And make no mistake.  That 
was the tragedy of Joe Paterno. He did run Penn State.  He did run Penn State.  And I 
know he ran Penn State because when Graham Spanier went to his house in 2004 and 
said, "Joe, it's time to retire," he threw him out.  They never spoke for 10 years.  Joe ran 
that school.   
 
19:11:40 
 
And when it was his chance to do what was the morally right thing to do, which was to 
go to the police, the culture of omerta that surrounds football, he did nothing except 
harbor a suspected child molester.  This is what we're dealing with in football.  A few

facts in what they call the football bowl subdivision, the big 125 schools.  Spending per 
student in those schools, $13,471.  Spending per athlete, $91,053.  6.8 times as much 
for a student athlete.  In the famed SEC, 11.6 times as much.  It's become a facility arms 
race. $15.2 billion spent on new athletic facilities, in particular, stadiums between 1995 
and 2005. 20 percent of current spending that by the way is not included in a lot of the 
revenue statements you'll see in NCAA reports.  And that's not from me, that's from 
Andrew Zimbalist who is considered the leading sports economic professor in the 
country from Smith College.   
 
19:12:51 
 
20 percent of current spending is on facility expansion, which is wonderful except what 
happens if these teams stop winning?  People will not go.  They will not go.  From USA 
Today June 16, 2011, more than $470 million, more than $470 million, most of it in 
student fees by students who do not play sports went into subsidized college athletic 
programs, in particular in football.  And this is in the era, a national trend of declining 
state support, tuition increases and salary freezes.  How many football programs have 
cut their budgets?  A few did in 2010, but it's back up.  It is back up.  It is back up.   
 
19:13:41 
 
Salaries of coaches, I mentioned it, average salary for a football coach, $1.47 million.  
That's up 55 percent in six seasons.  A professor, 1986 to 2007, his salary went up 30 
percent.  The college president, 100 percent.  The football coach, 500 percent.  500 
percent.  And I defy both of you to tell me why Urban Meyer deserves, of Ohio State, 
$24 million over six seasons.  I defy you to tell me that.  I defy you to tell me why Mack 
Brown deserves $5.192 million, not to mention the $850,000 bonus he will get.  And I 
can go down the ride.  Not to mention David Cutcliffe at Duke, which has a terrible 
football program, but we're seeing $1.762 million.   
 
19:14:40 
 
And there are all these myths, all of these myths, character, character from CBS/SI poll 
in 2011, 7 percent of college football players, 7 percent have criminal records, 7 percent. 
2,837 players, they studied the top 25 programs, at the top of the list, Pitt, Pitt, 22 
players on the team in 2010 have been charged with a crime.  Myth, increased alumni 
giving, myth, 2005, Robert Frank of the Johnson School of Management at Cornell, 
existing empirical literature supports that success of big time athletics has little if any 
systematic effect on the quality of incoming freshmen in institutions able to attract.  
That's the -- one of the things about football is it attracts better students…it does not.  It 
attracts more applications but the students are of low caliber.  Myth, football gives back.

Untrue, untrue, and I'll go into that later.  Graduation rates, graduation rates.  NCAA has 
the most ridiculous formula, the graduation success rate, now they've included the Ivy 
League, it's ridiculous.

John Donvan: 
Thank you, Buzz Bissinger.  The motion is, "Ban college football."  Our motion is "Ban 
college football," and our final debater against the motion is Jason Whitlock.  Jason is a 
national columnist with foxsports.com, he's a contributor to Fox Sports Radio, he 
lettered as an offensive tackle for Ball State University, and he was the first sportswriter 
to win a National Journalism award.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jason Whitlock.

Jason Whitlock: 
See, I mean, if we lose the debate, I should be blamed because I anticipated all of their 
arguments and if I do it justice, I will prove how ridiculous their arguments are or just -- 
not ridiculous because -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
No, ridiculous. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
-- Mr. Gladwell and Mr. Bissinger are two of the brightest minds that dabble in sports.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I did not mean that dismissively.  Trust me, if 
you've read their work, if you've read their work, they do much higher end stuff than 
just sports, and I'm -- they're lending their brains to sports occasionally.  But again, I 
don't mean that -- I mean that with all due respect.  We need to keep him -- I will not 
match Buzz's intensity or passion.

I think I can match wits with him and Mr. Gladwell.  Keep in mind, Mr. Gladwell is a 
Canadian and you guys are -- I'm not playing this for jokes, I'm being serious.  We live in 
a republic, a democracy.  Capitalism is our economic system.  The thing we value the 
most is freedom.  We're American and if you believe in freedom, you can't have the free 
without the dumb.  You can't have it.  They go hand in hand.  Freedom allows you to do 
dumb things, things we find reprehensible. 
 
[applause] 
 
And I would agree, you can put football right in there with cigarettes, alcohol, porn, 
everything else, things that we tolerate and enjoy here in America, but you cannot 
separate them.   
 
19:18:46 
 
And everything in America is connected to freedom and to capitalism and to democracy. 
And so you can't remove our institutions of higher education from capitalism and from 
freedom.  You can't.  We don't do that in America.  We let capitalism exploit everything 
whether we like it or not.  And so football has to be tolerated no different than Ronald 
McDonald.  Ronald McDonald has done far more damage to America than any football 
coach, any of these overpaid coaches that he's talking about. 
 
[applause] 
 
Mr. Bissinger argues rightfully, these coaches are overpaid.  Ronald McDonald was 
overpaid, Hugh Hefner’s overpaid, Jenna Jameson’s overpaid, what -- Charlie Sheen’s 
overpaid.  That’s America.  
 
[applause] 
 
19:19:46  
 
Mr. Bissinger argues in the Wall Street Journal and a little bit today that football is 
removed from the academic experience.  He is wrong.  People don’t understand 
football.  Many football players don’t even understand football.  But, and I mean this 
respectfully, I’m not playing this for laughs, I’m not trying to be dismissive, Mr. Gladwell, 
Mr. Bissinger, some of our brightest minds, have not participated in football.  And many 
of you in this audience have not participated in football.  Football, whether we like it or 
not, whether you understand it or not when I say it, but football is America.  It is the 
melting pot.  College football is the highest level of the melting pot.  Football is the 
Statue of Liberty.

College football.  Your huddled masses, your poor, your tired, people yearning to breath 
free.  I was one of those kids.  Football was my access into the mainstream and a better 
life. My dad didn’t graduate from high school, my mother was a factory worker.  I was 
the first person in my family to go off to college.  Football brings the poor and the rich, 
the black and the white, the Jews and the gentiles -- it brings everybody together, 
particularly at the college level.  Your high school experience, for the most part, is 
segregated.  Your little league experience is segregated.  Once you go all the way up to 
the pros, it’s more segregated because football is a game best played -- pardon, Tim’s an 
exception -- by the most desperate people on the planet.  It’s like boxing.  That’s why so 
many of the football players have hard luck stories in the National Football League.   
 
19:21:42 
 
They came from nothing, they had no other choices, so they had to be good at football.  
But on the college level, everybody comes together.  And I personally played next to -- I 
was a tackle, the guy next to me, right guard -- keeping it real, don’t laugh.  The guy next 
to me was a bigot.  His mom left his dad for a black man and he couldn’t get over it, and 
he was a bigot.  We were very good friends.  We’re still very good friends.  We found 
common ground through football.  College football, the bringing together of this diverse 
cross section of people pursuing one goal.  If they understood it on college campuses, 
they would teach college football, they would come and study college football and learn 
things so that -- I’m a part of the media.  I watch our major broadcast media and I watch 
the clueless, people that don’t have the diversity of experience that I have through 
college football and through life and I watch them consistently tear this country apart.   
 
19:22:53 
 
I watched them do it with George Zimmerman, OJ Simpson, Rodney King.  Whatever the 
big media story.  Barack Obama.  Consistently tear this country apart.  The reason why -- 
and if people have ever read my column and understood my perspective, the reason 
why I never lose faith in America is because of my college football experience.  I have 
seen people of different backgrounds overcome tremendous differences to compete for 
one goal. That’s what we allegedly are trying to do here in America.  I think the 
argument to ban college football is being argued by well-intentioned people who don’t 
clearly understand the sport.   
 
19:23:44 
 
America is imperfect.  The Statue of Liberty does not promise perfection.  Our 
Constitution doesn’t promise perfection.  We pursue perfection.  College football needs 
to be reshaped, remade, less games, less practice, less padded practice -- 
 
John Donvan:

Jason Whitlock:

John Donvan: 
-- I’m sorry, your time is up.  Jason -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
It does not need to be banned. 
 
John Donvan: 
Your time is up.  Let’s give a round of applause.  Thank you, Jason Whitlock. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  And now we go 
onto round two, which is where the debaters address each other directly and also 
answer questions from you in the audience and from me.  We have two teams of two 
who are arguing out this motion, "ban college football."  Arguing for the motion, we’ve 
heard from Buzz Bissinger and Malcolm Gladwell.  They’re arguing that college football 
is something like a kind of toxic spill in this society.   
 
19:24:39 
 
They make two kinds of arguments, one, the medical argument that it abuses the 
players, hurts them physically, literally is rattling the brains in their heads, and a 
financial argument that college football twists universities' priorities so that these 
schools are less in the education business than they are in the football business, that in 
these -- on those campuses, football becomes a distraction.  The team arguing against 
the motion, Jason Whitlock and Tim Greenfield, they both played in college, and they 
are arguing that football is a great unifier for the players and for schools.  For the 
schools, they provide identity and loyalty.  For the players as individuals, they provide 
character and discipline and a shot at education that many of them may not have had.  
And they also dispute almost all of the medical claims made by the other side.  So we 
want to have them mix it up now.  And I want to go to the side arguing against the 
motion.  Your opponents are making a very broad philosophical argument that college 
football, as it stands now has no place on university campuses because it makes the 
schools more about football than it does about education, that this actually causes harm 
-- you make the argument that it's good for the players.  
 
19:25:47 
 
They're making the argument, maybe so, but it's bad for everybody else because it just 
messes up what the school is supposed to be about, messes up the finances.  And they

broke this down to a very specific question: Why should these coaches be making 
millions of dollars and millions of dollars more than the president of universities? 
 
Tim Green: 
Why shouldn't they be making millions of dollars more?  Why -- I mean, this is America.  
And Jason said it.  This is a country where we allow pop stars and rappers and hedge 
fund managers -- we allow people to make whatever the market determines that it 
should make.  And I don't understand why we would begrudge anyone any amount of 
money -- 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Wait.  That’s your defense, that hedge fund managers are just as bad?  At this point 
can’t we declare the debate over? 
 
Tim Green: 
What I'm saying is I don't -- I wouldn't begrudge -- I don't begrudge you the revenues 
from your wonderfully successful books or Buzz, "Friday Night Lights."  We're all big 
fans.  I don't begrudge you that.  Whatever you get is what you get. And whatever the 
market determines, that's what you earn. 
 
19:26:45  
 
John Donvan: 
Buzz Bissinger. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
I understand, but first of all, these are not for profit institutions.  Second of all, athletic 
departments are notoriously bureaucracy heavy, notorious.  Ohio State has an athletic 
department of 478 people which is twice as much as the English department at Ohio 
State. So let's face it.  It ain't about capitalism because they're nonprofit institutions.  
They're not responsible to stockholders.  Plus, the Knight Foundation, which has studied 
football and sports more than any entity in the country in the past 20 years has said 
there is absolutely no correlation between a winning record and the amount of a 
coach's salary. 
 
Tim Green: 
You talk about what's wrong -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Tim Green. 
 
Tim Green: 
-- with football with academics, right?  You talked about --

Buzz Bissinger: 
Yes. 
 
Tim Green:

19:27:42  
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
20. 
 
Tim Green: 
40.  40 hours a week.  I talked about the graduation rate -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
40 hours a week what? 
 
Tim Green: 
You talk about the bureaucracy and the money that's spent on football, maybe that 
money, maybe the general student population -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
40 hours a week doing what? 
 
Tim Green: 
40 hours a week studying, 40 hours -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Where'd you get that from? 
 
Tim Green: 
-- a week playing football.  From the NCAA. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
I think -- personally, I think --

Listen, you know, Buzz, let's not get into where we got stuff, where you got your 
numbers where I got mine.

Buzz hang on a second and just let -- Buzz, hang on a second.  I'll come back to you.  
Okay.  Go ahead, Tim.  Finish your point. 
 
Tim Green: 
So -- so football's doing a good job.  They're doing a good job educating their players. 
They're educating them at a better and a higher rate than the general population.  
Maybe academia should take a page out of the playbook from the football program. 
 
John Donvan: 
Malcolm Gladwell, your opponent said -- your opponent's made the point -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Your opponent's made the point that football players' rate of graduation is actually 
increasing.  Can you take that on? 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Well, first of all, that's small comfort if you get a degree in a short term and a massive 
brain injury in the long term.   
 
[laughter] 
 
But secondly -- 
 
19:28:45  
 
Tim Green: 
You can't -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let him finish. 
 
Tim Green: 
But you can't say that. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let him finish. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
The other thing that I -- almost everything that our two opponents said, I agree with if 
they simply substituted in another sport for football, right?  The issue is not that football 
does all kinds of wonderful things.  Of course it does.  Do football players graduate?  Of 
course they do.  Do they learn all kinds of wonderful character things?  Absolutely.  But

do we have to bash them over the head in order to communicate those virtues?  Why 
can't they row? Why can't they kick a soccer ball?  Why can't they -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
They can, but those sports won't generate -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Jason Whitlock. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
They won't generate enough money to sustain themselves.  And again, I just want to go 
back to -- 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
It's about money now?  They have to get hit over the head because they can't get 
money otherwise? 
 
John Donvan: 
[unintelligible]. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
In terms of funding all the other sports you're talking about that you like.  Yes, they do 
have to get hit over the head on Saturdays to pay for that, absolutely. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
But Jason, Jason, you're -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
To pay for the rowing team and the soccer team and all the other sports that no one 
cares about.  Yes. 
 
19:29:48  
 
John Donvan: 
Buzz Bissinger. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Your argument is a perfect argument for why football should not be at academic 
institutions. Make it into a minor league system then.  You'll get the same benefits that 
you're talking about.  The melting pot -- by the way, the melting pot also, I think, 
includes Latinos and Asian-Americans.  And if you can name four Jews who played 
football, you win the debate.

why couldn't they be rowing?  Per hundred thousand students, student athletes, in 
rowing, how many indirect fatalities a year?  16.  How many in football?  2.2.  So why 
are we going to let them row?

But you, it's --  
 
Tim Green: 
Look, you've got to look at numbers.  You can't just say -- you can't just throw it out 
there and say, oh, it does all this damage, a hundred Gs which is -- that's not correct.  All 
this damage to the head.  Look, if there is long-term damage to the brain, okay, and 
maybe I'm living proof of it.  But if there is long-term damage to the brain, I'm the first 
one to say, boy, maybe we should look at it.  But do we eliminate all these other -- 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Well, you can't -- 
 
John Donvan:

Tim Green: 
-- sports as well? 
 
John Donvan:

Malcolm Gladwell: 
Here's the thing.  At that moment in your -- in your remarks when you were comparing 
fatality rates between sports, I was incredulous. 
 
Tim Green: 
I was too. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
We're not talking about -- I'm not talking about fatalities on the field.  We're talking 
about long-term health consequences that show up 20 and 30 years later. 
 
19:31:43  
 
Tim Green: 
Show me the studies. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Here's why we don't know what the long-term consequences of football are, because 
you have to shoot yourself and have an autopsy before we know whether you have CTE 
in your brain.

Yeah, but -- you know what?  Let me --

John Donvan:

Jason Whitlock: 
I think, though, we're so caught up in the Junior Seau, Dave Duerson and the 
aberrations.  I don't think that's the norm.  I don't think that -- and yes, they make news, 
and they -- we can write about them, and people will be interested in it.  I think what 
we're arcing, Malcolm, is that's not the case for the overwhelming majority of people 
that play football, because the overwhelming majority stop in high school.  And then the 
next big group stops at college.  And now we have some examples of a few pro athletes 
that have had these amazing problems.  We haven't seen the studies that say college 
athletes -- 
 
John Donvan: 
The two -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
-- in any significant number have these problems. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jason, the two of you who have played, I want to ask you, I mean, given the arguments 
made on the other side, you both probably hit your head a bunch of times.   
 
19:32:48 
 
I mean, they're arguing you're two very successful guys, you might be a lot more 
successful if you hadn't played football.  But do you actually worry about the statistics 
that Malcolm is citing, since you both have played the game?  Do you worry about it? 
 
Tim Green: 
I have concerns, but this is the cell phone syndrome, folks.  Ten years ago, people said, 
"Cell phones, cell phones next to the head.  It's brain cancer.  Cell phones, brain cancer." 
And everyone said, oh, my gosh, cell phones, brain cancer.  And I'm walking around, my 
wife's saying, "You can't use your cell phone.  You can't hold it next to your head."  And I 
started to believe it.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, I've got to use my speakerphone.  I've got to 
use the thing.  Guess what?  They've done studies, long-term studies, and they found 
there is no correlation between cell phones and brain cancer.

There are 64 players in the National Football League who are currently suing the league 
over their brain injuries, right?

That is the thin end of the wedge.  We don't know how large the group of affected 
players is.  And the question for us is --

We can't use lawsuits.

development of young people?

Buzz Bissinger: 
Well, I mean, listen, our -- have the studies been definitive?  No.  However -- 
 
Tim Green: 
Thank you. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
-- of the -- but wait a sec.  BU has studied the brains of 44 players who died early either 
because of Alzheimer's, suicide, which is a very, very complex issue, I agree with Jason 
about why Junior Seau died.  We don't know.  But in each of those 44 brains, they found 
advanced CTE.  Their brains were shriveled.  The first case was Andre Waters who shot 
himself at the age of 43.   
 
19:34:44 
 
Forget suicide, when they looked at his brain, they said he had the brain of a 67-year-old 
man, and you know, you know how Andre Waters played, he probably suffered 25 to 30 
concussions during his career.  So you have 44 cases in which there were advanced signs 
of CTE in players who either had Alzheimer's, early Alzheimer's, or died.  So there are

There are 6,000 former NFL players over the last 20 years, and you're talking about -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
A thousand are filing suit. 
 
Tim Green: 
Take 6,000 clergymen, 6,000 university professors, 6,000 bus drivers, here's -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
But Tim, there's a class action suit filed by a thousand NFL players. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
I don't want to be this cynical, but -- I don't want to be this cynical, but this is also 
America. We sue over everything. 
 
[applause] 
 
You get broke and desperate, you -- seriously, I've written about this in the past, about 
remember we had this whole deal about the old NFL players not being taken care of by 
the current players.

And I called it "The old NFL --" they want reparations because they're jealous of how 
much money the current players are making. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Do you honestly think -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
Absolutely, absolutely. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Tim, now, let me ask you, you played. 
 
Tim Green: 
Is suing a good thing, like cigarettes, porn, and football? 
 
[laughter] 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
No, but it's just what we do.  Everybody -- if you can't earn it, you'll sue somebody to get 
it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Malcolm Gladwell. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
That's America. [laughs] 
 
John Donvan: 
Malcolm Gladwell. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
I think all of you are -- the two of you are sidestepping the crucial fact here, and that is, 
yes, this is a complex topic, yes, this is clearly a heated topic, yes, we don't know what 
the full extent of this damage is, the issue is what do we do at our institutions of higher 
learning in the interim. 
 
Tim Green: 
That's what I want to respond to.

Tim Green: 
That's what I want to respond to. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
What is the prudent step?  And you guys seem to take the position that until we have 
definitive proof -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
The appropriate step to take is to walk things back.  They're playing too many games, I 
agree.   
 
19:36:42 
 
They should walk it back to 11 games.  The coaches are earning too much.  They should 
share some with the players.  They should have less padded practices and less contact -- 
they should walk things back until we figure it out.  You don't just jump to banning -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
Right. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
-- we would have banned cell phones 10 years ago -- 
 
John Donvan: 
You're yielding --

Male Speaker: 
Neither of you -- 
 
John Donvan: 
You're actually yielding a lot of their points, that there's a real problem there, so you do 
yield -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
No one denies there's a problem.  
 
Tim Green: 
There was a problem back in 1976 --

John Donvan: 
So the head injuries are real and the money problem is real. 
 
Tim Green: 
Look it, helmets have got better in 1976, the rules changed in 1976, absolutely.  I mean, 
we're not saying, "Oh, you know, just go on -- carry on as usual."  Yeah, change the rules 
a little bit, continue to modify, have the strike zone, no helmets to helmet hits -- hang 
on, Buzz -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
I'm with you. 
 
Tim Green: 
Yeah, modify the rules, pay the players, keep making the helmets safer and safer which 
they are, do everything we can to protect, but don't -- this is America. We don't ban 
things.   
 
19:37:44 
 
People can burn the flag.  We don't ban that.  You don't ban college football. 
 
John Donvan: 
Buzz Bissinger. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
But the greater issue, which neither of you have answered, is what is the academic 
purpose of football on a university campus, and why are we the only nation in the world 
that looks to universities to provide a primary source of athletic entertainment?  You 
talk about kids getting -- you know what the graduation rate of football players should 
be?  100 percent.  Do you know why?  They get a free scholarship, not only that -- 
 
Tim Green: 
It's not free, Buzz. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
They get a -- 
 
Tim Green: 
It's not free.  You work for it. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
-- Tim, I didn't interrupt you.  Do not interrupt me.  They get a scholarship.  Beyond that, 
you have the Phil Knights and the University of Texas.  Phil Knight built a $44 million Taj

average student?  They get tutors. 
 
19:38:44  
 
John Donvan: 
Tim Green. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
They get every ancillary benefit. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
And the graduation rate -- and, by the way, the federal rate is 56 percent because the 
NCAA has all sorts of gimmicks called its graduation success rate. 
 
John Donvan: 
Buzz, Buzz, this is landing well.  I want to let him respond. 
 
Tim Green: 
I'll concede that instead of 55 it's 56, all right? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
As a -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Take on the question.  Why -- he's talking about a great imbalance in disparity and 
where the investment goes. 
 
Tim Green: 
The money goes to where people pay for it.  People want -- look, this is America. People 
want winners.  They wanted the programs to win.  And they'll pay for it.  I agree with 
Jason, the coaches should split some of that salary, create a stipend for the players.  I'm 
in full agreement.  Again, look it, you guys can't just say, "Well, football needs to change, 
there's bad things about it."  Yeah, there are.  There are some things that are dangerous, 
that's unsettling.  Are we going to not allow -- no students should allowed to be driving 
motor vehicles.  That is 100 times more dangerous.

I want to ask Buzz -- just one second.

Don’t ask, don’t tell, Buzz. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
-- would you -- Buzz, would you agree that Boobie probably required more support if he 
-- did he deserve an opportunity -- if he had been good enough to go onto college, 
would he not deserve perhaps a little more support academically to get through school?  
I mean, considering his background.  And Boobie was a great character in Buzz’s “Friday 
Night Lights” book. 
 
19:40:42  
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Because -- would he have gotten more support?  Yes. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
No, would you say the kid deserved it, though?  Wouldn’t that be a good thing? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
If he effectively used it, sure, but I think they are given that support to pass them 
through and make sure that they are eligible -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
Having experienced -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
And, Jason, the graduation rates for African American players is -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
Complex reasons, Buzz.  Complex reasons.

John Donvan: 
I’m going hope -- Tim. 
 
Tim Green: 
-- quickly throw -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Tim Green. 
 
Tim Green: 
-- two numbers at you.  Since 1984 the graduation for football players across the board 
has increased 10 percent.  That’s a good thing.  It’s a good trend.  In the last 10 years.  
So that’s 25 years.  In the last 10 years there has been a 15 percent increase in African 
American football players alone.  So it’s not perfect, but guess what?  Against the 
general population, which is going down, the football players are going up.  And maybe 
it does require a little bit more money to get them there with the tutors and the 
academic centers but they are earning it.  They are paying for it with their efforts in 
practice and in the games on Saturday afternoon. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Buzz, do you have something further to say on that -- do you have something to move 
that forward?  Because I think you’ve stated your case.  I want to put a question to this 
side because there’s something about your argument that I realize I’m not clear on.  Do 
you believe that athletics have a place, a formal place, in education, period?  In the 
same way, for example, that music, painting, performance may?   
 
19:42:43 
 
Do those things belong on campus?  Is athletics part of an education in the college level? 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Absolutely. 
 
John Donvan:

Malcolm Gladwell: 
For all -- 
 
John Donvan: 
How does it fit in, then? 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Malcolm Gladwell: 
For all of the reasons I think that were so articulately stated by Mr. Green and Mr. 
Whitlock. They are opportunities to build character, to learn teamwork, to bring people 
from different backgrounds together.  All of that’s true. 
 
John Donvan: 
So you’re saying it’s -- Buzz, you’re saying it’s the way in which football is happening 
now? In other words, if you went back 50 years -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Well, I mean, it’s the way -- no, because there is -- the myth of the student athlete is a 
myth. In the early 1900s, when the Ivy League ruled football, you know what they did?  
They hired these kids, they gave them a shared of the gate receipts, they never went to 
school, and they were not expected to go to school.  This is a myth propagated by 
people like Grantland Rice, who raise these players to Biblical proportions and Ronald 
Reagan playing win one for the Gipper.   
 
19:43:48 
 
Now, in 1950 the average SAT score of an athlete was 18 points below the average 
student.  It is now exponentially lower and I’m not sure -- and Tim played.  But what 
does football -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait, wait, Buzz, just -- I just want to finish up the -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Sure. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- point that Malcolm started.  So where does athletics in general and football 
specifically fit into the process of education? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Football does not fit into the process of a college education, not when we rank 14th in 
the world -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But rowing does? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Rowing may to some degree.  
 
John Donvan:

Why? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
They could all be college sports. 
 
John Donvan: 
What’s the -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
They could all be club sports.  Honestly, we are so athletic-obsessed, and for what?  For 
what?  I mean, the number of scholarships that we give out, does Penn State really need 
29 varsity sports?  Does it?   
 
19:44:43 
 
Is it right that the single biggest individual contribution given was $70 million for 
establishment of a Division 1 hockey program at a time when tuition is going up?  And I 
imagine a lot of those students are leaving because they can no longer afford school, 
unlike your football players. 
 
John Donvan: 
Tim Green. 
 
Tim Green: 
I just don't -- I honestly -- I don't understand why opportunities for student athletes 
makes you so angry.  I don't. I don't understand why you begrudge college athletes 
scholarships, especially when part of your own argument is that these guys -- these 
football players and basketball players are being exploited because the revenues that 
they generate.  Those revenues that they generate are used to pay for -- you talked 
about the expenses that are there, the expenses, it's all part of the show.  And they pay 
for it dearly. They work very hard and you do take risks.   
 
19:45:43 
 
You don't take risks, you know, any more than a lot of other sports.  You take less risks 
than riding a bicycle or driving a car, but you do take risks, and you put forth 
tremendous effort. And from those efforts, you should -- we're in agreement.  You 
should get something back. So which one is it, Buzz?  I mean, do you want -- do you 
want players to -- football players to have the opportunities of education as 
compensation for their efforts or don't you?  You're mixing messages. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  I want to go to questions from the audience, but first I want to tell you, so we 
are now in the question and audience section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.

debating this motion: "ban college football."  And how this will work, if you raise your 
hand, I'll call on you.  Just wait till a microphone comes to you.  And you're being filmed 
too, so please stand up so that we can see you.  Hold the microphone about a fist's 
distance from your mouth so that it can hear you clearly.  We'd appreciate it if you could

And I really urge you to make your question a question, and you'll recognize it as such 
because a question mark naturally goes at the end of it. 
 
[laughter] 
 
And try to keep it on topic.  You know, there's a lot of places we could go with this.  We 
really want the question to get these guys talking about in a way that helps you make 
your decision on whether to ban college football or not to.  Sir in the far back, you're 
wearing a black sweater with horizontal white stripes.  I can't see you, by the way, if

on you.  Sir, go ahead. 
 
Rick Levy: 
Yes.  My name is Rick Levy.  I'm not a member of the media, but I do have a question 
regarding the health of a football player.  With the exposure in the New Orleans Saints 
for pay for injuring players, is this, in your experience, happening in college as well?  Are 
college players being rewarded for injuring their opponents? 
 
19:47:48  
 
John Donvan: 
Which brings us to the large area of corruption which we haven't discussed greatly.  
Which side would like to take that first?  Because we can take it to either side.  Buzz

Well, I don't -- I would think not.  I mean, I would think not.  But you know, if you want 
to talk corruption, if you want to talk academic cheating, the numbers --

Wait.  Let me just -- let me just answer.  Let me answer his question, because I do -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Buzz, I will come back to you. 
 
Tim Green: 
-- I do happen to know that.  In the National Football League, what happened with the 
New Orleans Saints was an aberration.  In my eight years of playing in the NFL, in my 10 
years as a broadcaster for FOX Sports and knowing players intimately throughout the 
league, I never heard of anything quite like it, neither did anyone else.   
 
19:48:43 
 
By the way, people knew about what was happening with the New Orleans Saints for 
the past three years.  And they were warned over and over again, "We hear this.  You

guys better stop.  This is absolutely crazy."  It's crazy.  It's wrong.  It was despicable.  It's 
an aberration.  It doesn't happen in pro football, other places, and it certainly has no 
place, and it has not happened to my knowledge in the college [unintelligible]. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Now you know if anybody wants to stand up and say, "Buzz, what about 
corruption?" he's ready to go.  So -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger:

How many is that?  I know you'll say that's anecdotal.  Academic cheating, Florida State, 
61 players took online courses where they received answers beforehand or did no work.  
The team had to vacate wins during those seasons.  UNC which has been invoked, all 
these football players for some reason were taking --

But the vast majority of college football players.  You said 7 percent of college football 
players have been arrested.  That's about -- that's probably about the average in the 
college male population.   
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
No actually it’s not. 
 
Tim Green: 
Wait a minute.  Hang on.  You're talking about all these people that have -- look, you've 
got to add the numbers up.  If you've got 30 that broke the rules, how many hundreds 
do you have who didn't break the rules?  If you've got a handful of players who 
committed suicide and then had serious brain damage, which that makes sense, right? 
and that horrible tragedy, how many didn't commit suicide?

accept? Because they actually are talking about let's make some changes.  Can --

There are suggestions [unintelligible] reform. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  What would be -- let's do it that way.  What would your suggestions about and 
what -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
I've answered that previously.  I think a shorter season, less practice time, sharing the 
wealth with the athletes would be some -- I think in my day we played 11 games. Now 
they play 14 or 15 games.  It's ridiculous.  It's complete and total exploitation.  You could 
-- 10-game season is completely appropriate.  To go to a bowl game, you play in 11. You 
know, just the more contact, the more likely you are to get injured -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
-- so less games would be -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Wait, let me just see if there's anything else on their list. 
 
Tim Green: 
I think the colleges should continue to work and with the NFL to continue to research 
and find better and better equipment to protect the players and to continue to -- to kind 
of tinker with the rules, create the strike zone for the quarter back, eliminate -- try to 
eliminate helmet to helmet.   
 
19:52:53 
 
You're never going to eliminate it completely, but have a strict liability code where 
players who do hit helmet to helmet, you'll remove them from the game, suspend them 
the next time, and then make it very serious. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  Would any of those steps make a difference to new your conviction to ban 
college football?

Buzz Bissinger: 
This is a very radical solution.  It's got all sorts of problems.  I understand that.  But 
people are talking about universities.  You license out your name.  And basically you're 
creating a de facto subsidiary.  The universities are out of it.  You still call it USC.  You still 
call it whatever.  You still call it Nebraska.  You still call it Syracuse.  But it's out of the 
university system.  The university gets a licensing fee.  They negotiate it.  It basically is a 
minor league system that is separate.  Or, you know what?  You get rid of it.  You don't 
penalize the players.   
 
19:53:41 
 
You know who the biggest villain in this is?  The NFL.  The NFL does not pay a single 
dime for what is the greatest boondoggle and farm system ever created. 
 
John Donvan: 
And Malcolm, Malcolm -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
So make the NFL pony up with a developmental league. 
 
John Donvan: 
Malcolm, the other -- the other part of their -- many of their suggestions are related to 
making the game safer, so can you take that on? 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Well, I would -- the thing that I would be happy with is intramural flag football.

Thank you.  Yeah, Tim Green would like a chance to respond to that. 
 
Tim Green: 
Can I -- in your farm team system, where every school gets to have their own farm team, 
do the players get to go to class?  Do they get an education at the same time? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
I would think you would give the -- you know, it's an unwieldy mechanism.  I think you 
give the players that option.  If they want to be called, "student athletes," and they're 
actually going to class and they're interested in getting an education, fine, if they don't 
want to go, don't make them because I have a feeling that most of them probably don't 
want to go.

Yeah. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Why? 
 
Tim Green: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 
Buzz Bissinger. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Because it's a game and because the NCAA knows and college football knows that we're 
under a lot of scrutiny for our graduation rates so they push him through.  Why does 
Stanford have an easy class list that football players -- "Here are the classes you take." 
Why?  Tim, why?  Why would they?  Why would UNC --

some people get their degrees in -- I don't want to disparage any other degrees, but 
there are all kinds of things.  You know, if you're -- if you get a degree in business or a 
degree in the liberal arts -- 
 
Male Speaker: 
But I -- 
 
Tim Green: 
-- an English degree. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let's go to another question.  Right in the aisle, there.  Yeah. 
 
Female Speaker: 
Hi, I also am just an average person and a sports fan.  My name's Ashley.  There is a 
scholar out of Duke University who has correlated the top 25 universities in the world, 
22 -- 21, 22 of them are in the U.S., with the big sports programs, having an effect on 
bringing the community together and getting behind even if it doesn't directly 
contribute to the bottom line of the university or show honor. And that's one of the 
reasons that even though our recent numbers haven't been great, our overall numbers 
of top universities are indeed higher. 
 
19:58:40  
 
John Donvan: 
So what is your question? 
 
Female Speaker: 
So the question is do you feel that, that holds any weight, one of the questions that 
you've posed several times is what is the purpose of football and other athletics in 
higher education, and if it's overall to bring our universities to the top of the line -- 
 
John Donvan: 
So is your question is -- and I may be wrong -- but is your question what about the -- and 
this side has made this case -- the beneficial effect on bringing a university together, 
giving it an identity, giving it a sense of purpose and unity -- 
 
Female Speaker: 
Right. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- so you think that's real, and you're asking this side if that is -- if they think it's real and 
if they think it's worth it.

Female Speaker: 
Right. 
 
John Donvan: 
Malcolm Gladwell. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
I -- you know, the thing that I always come back to that has mystified me throughout 
this whole debate is what on earth is so special about football?  I mean, if 50 years ago 
or 75 years ago the major colleges had all decided that they would compete at 
Monopoly -- 
 
[laughter] 
 
-- and that somehow Monopoly had gotten lodged in the imagination of the American 
scholar Monopoly player.  And that they started to give out scholarships for Monopoly 
players and then the Monopoly coaches earned millions of dollars and they built large 
stadia, which 1,000 people would come to watch the Monopoly players compete against 
each other.   
 
19:59:51 
 
And then suddenly it was observed that Monopoly had gotten out of control and we 
said, “Maybe it’s time for us to turn our back on Monopoly.”  I can imagine the two of 
you just standing up there and saying, “No.”  There’s something magical about this 
game. 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah, but her question for -- 
 
[applause] 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
My point is there is nothing -- it’s just a game.  Replace it with another game. 
 
John Donvan: 
But her question persists that she -- whether it makes no sense to you or not -- 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Yeah. 
 
John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

-- her question is she feels that this effect is there and is real, and I want to ask you if 
you think it’s there and if it’s real and if it’s worth it. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
My point is -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me take -- well, go ahead. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
My point is it’s probably real but you could get it with something else.  Monopoly.  Let’s 
try it. 
 
[laughter] 
 
John Donvan: 
Buzz Bissinger. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Well, I mean, I think, you know, it’s like anything in life.  If a team is winning and 
successful with certain exceptions like a Texas or an LSU or an Alabama, if you’re 
winning students go, alumni go, if you’re losing they tend not to go.   
 
20:00:45 
 
I’m not sure if you’re saying that the 25 biggest, best universities in the world have 
superb football programs because I don’t think that’s correct.  I just don’t, because on 
that list is Harvard, Yale, Penn, University of Chicago, and last time I checked the Ivy 
League sucks. 
 
[laughter] 
 
But, anyway, it does bring students together.  But -- however, there was a study done at 
the University of Oregon by several economists that was in the National Economic 
Review that showed when the Oregon football team was winning men’s grades went 
down significantly. They did -- you might think it’s a laugh but it’s not.  By an equivalent 
of 27 SAT points, they studied half as much, and they drank twice as much.  So that’s 
what football does.  It makes you drunk and stupid.

Tim Green: 
Malcolm, you asked what’s so special about football and I want to seriously try to 
answer that because I’m a dad and I encourage my kid -- I don’t -- if they don’t want to 
be athletes and they don’t want to play sports, that’s fine.   
 
20:01:51 
 
They can do whatever they want to do.  But if they want to be athletes, I encourage 
them.  I’ve coached a lot of sports and I’ve coached football.  And the thing that I love 
about all sports is one of the things Jason said. Teamwork.  Bringing people together for 
a common cause, working together, learning that even if you’re not the most important 
part of a team you can make a difference and help that team win, learning that you have 
to get along with people even if you don’t like them, to have -- if you have a common 
goal.  The perseverance element of sports.  And I think the thing that I love most about 
football is, and this is what I say to the kids I coach, I say -- and the parents.  I say, 
“You’re going -- when you go out into the world you are going to be knocked down.  You 
are going to be knocked down and guess what?  It’s not always going to be fair.  And 
sometimes you’re going to be cheated.  And sometimes people are going to do things to 
you that they shouldn’t do."   
 
20:02:44 
 
And all of this happens in a game of football, and it happens in a very confined, intense 
experience.  And I’m telling you that, as a football player and football players, you learn 
to get knocked down -- 
 
John Donvan: 
But, Tim -- 
 
Tim Green: 
-- “and get back up.” 
 
John Donvan: 
-- that doesn’t beat the Monopoly argument because -- 
 
Tim Green: 
Oh, it does. 
 
John Donvan: 
No, I mean, seriously.  
 
Tim Green: 
No, it does.

Oh, okay.  No, you’re right. 
 
John Donvan: 
-- what’s good for the rest of the university. 
 
Tim Green: 
I thought he meant what’s so good about football as a player. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Look, I mean, football is a part of the American soul.  It goes to, frankly, our celebration 
of -- we like being a violent, hard-assed country.  What I resent is that why don’t you get 
all those things in the school newspaper when you put on a play? When you’re in the 
orchestra you get all these things.  Perseverance, caring.  Football players don’t really 
have to deal with people. They’re told by 23 coaches what to do and all those pursuits 
have much more long-lived academic pursuits. 
 
20:03:47  
 
John Donvan:

Buzz Bissinger: 
You have to write. 
 
John Donvan: 
Jason Whitlock. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
You have to learn critical thinking. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
Well, I think on a college campus a lot of those endeavors that you’re talking about, and 
some of them -- I participated in my school newspaper.  Again, those tend to be 
segregated endeavors that don’t reach the cross section of people that football does 
and, you know, that’s unfortunate.  But it’s the American reality, and football is the one 
thing on the field and even in the stands that seems to bring America together across a 
lot of different backgrounds.

Buzz Bissinger. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Henry Gates, Sports Illustrated 1981.  And we all know who he is and I think we respect 
him obviously.  “The blind pursuit of attainment in sports is having a devastating effect 
on our people.  Imbued with a belief that our principal avenue is to face and -- is to 
profit through sports, far too many black kids treat basketball courts and football fields 
as if they were classrooms in an alternate school system."   
 
20:04:54 
 
That's Henry Gates.  Henry Gates.  Now, Henry Gates also -- and then I'll stop.  Henry 
Gates, he went back to his hometown.  He asked people, how many black pro athletes 
do you think there were?  The guesses were wild.  Half a million, 50,000.  But what he 
was distressed by -- no one believed him when he said there are 12 times more black 
lawyers than pro athletes.  20 times more dentists and 15 times more doctors.  So I 
frankly think that you are selling a bill of goods to inner city kids that athletics is the way 
out because there are a lot of other ways out. 
 
[applause] 
 
John Donvan: 
Jason.  Jason Whitlock. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
There's many -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Jason Whitlock. 
 
20:05:39  
 
Jason Whitlock: 
Because it's America, and because of freedom, you have to take responsibility for 
yourself. And so trust me, having gone through the athletic and academic experience, 
Ball State University and every other university that my friends attended, they put all 
the academic goodies right on the table for you to take.  And sometimes they put you in 
a -- you know, get your head and try to stuff the academic -- it's up to you to open your 
mouth and take it. That's America.  And so these issues, whether we're trying to reduce 
to black and white sometimes are far more complicated, and it has to do with -- for me, 
I tried to quit college football.  My parents wouldn't allow it.  Would not allow it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Why did you want to quit? 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 53 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

 
Jason Whitlock: 
Because it was hard.  And me and my coach didn't get along, and I had a big mouth.  And 
I tried to quit.  And my parents are like, "Good luck, buddy.  You're on your own."   
 
20:06:43 
 
And luckily I had those kinds of parents.  They wouldn't let me quit.  I played with a lot 
of guys that didn't have those kinds of parents or didn't have parents.  And so we're 
blaming institutions a lot of times for things that a foundation with a kid has to be 
established from birth all the way up until the point you hand them over to the 
institution.  And if that foundation is not there, if that support system is not there, 
you're going to fail.  That's America.  And so it's -- we can demonize the universities and 
the institutions.  But, you know, there's clearly a breakdown in family throughout 
America that is most acute in African American community.  And it contributes to a lot 
of these problems that Mr. Bissinger's talking about. 
 
John Donvan: 
Okay.  I want to do a -- I want to do a -- a break to -- we're going to take a quick break.  
Now the quick break is over.   
 
20:07:44 
 
And I just want to ask you to give us a round of applause to lead me back into it.  
Thanks.

So we are in the question-and-answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  
I'm John Donvan.  We have four debaters, two against two, who are arguing it out over 
this motion: "Ban college football."  We're doing questions from the audience.  Front 
row.  Makes me nervous when I see that you've written out your question.  I hope it's 
like only four lines.  No, go ahead.  Start again, please.  Sorry. 
 
Jason Troklis: 
Jason Troklis [spelled phonetically].  I'm not a member of the media.  A question for 
Jason Whitlock, actually: You've been talking a lot about freedom and American values, 
capitalist and so forth.  I think we can all agree that college football is not -- and pro 
football is not a free labor market.  People have to play for three years in the NCAA 
before they can be eligible for the draft.   
 
20:08:41 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 54 -

  Arlington, VA 22203 

The fact that there is a draft is a little bit ridiculous.  I think most labor economists would 
agree.  My question to you is, would you do away with these restrictions on freedom for 
the players, number one?  And number two, would college football exist if you did? 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
I would not do away with them because, you know, I am pro restraint on freedom 
within reason.  And so no, I actually think it's for the players' best benefit to go on and 
participate in college football.  You know, so no, I'm not for capitalism.  We need a 
system of checks and balances throughout our society.  And so there need to be -- 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Wait.  Now I'm really confused.  I've just been listening to you for the last half hour 
going on about freedom and dumbing.  And all of a sudden now you're not for freedom 
any more. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
Well, no, I am for freedom, but -- 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Except when you're not. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
No.  That's why we have government and rules and regulations.  And there are restraints 
on freedom.  We can't kill each other. 
 
20:09:45  
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Well, then Jason, let me ask you this. 
 
John Donvan: 
Buzz Bissinger. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
And no offense.  You definitely had concussions when you played.  I'm convinced of 
that. But anyway, I know that was inappropriate.  All right. 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
No.  That was a good joke.  Buzz and I are friends. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Anyway, I was doing so well up until then. 
 
Jason Whitlock:

Buzz plays rough, I can handle it. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Are in favor, then of an antitrust exemption and many labor economists are who study 
sports in which no head coach gets more than $400,000 a year, which is a lot of money.  
Are you in favor of that? 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
400,000, I don't know if that would be my limit.  But yeah, I'm for -- I wish Congress or 
our government would step in and put some restraints on the NCAA and college 
football. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
And let's face it.  The only reason that three-year rule is in effect is because -- and I think 
Tim will agree -- you need that amount of time to develop as a football player. 
 
Tim Green: 
Right. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
-- to be ready for the pros.  So that's the only reason.  You know, it's what the NFL 
wants. And basketball, which frankly -- major college basketball is in worse shape than 
football because of the one year and out.   
 
20:10:45 
 
You know, the five starting players of Kentucky, all the freshmen are leaving school.  So, 
you know, everything is done basically for the sake either of money or so-called 
branding or the pros. 
 
John Donvan: 
Sir, did you come all the way down from the back?  I'm -- you've earned your question. 
 
Vince Percoccio: 
The question is actually -- my name is Vince Percoccio [spelled phonetically].  I'm not a 
member of the media.  It's actually to Mr. Whitlock, and it's on the topic of freedom.  
But if you do have a ban, how do you craft legislation that would make the rest of us 
feel somewhat uncomfortable about over [unintelligible] -- 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
Setting a precedent that could be used to ban basketball next. 
 
Vince Percoccio: 
Exactly.  Exactly.

Jason Whitlock: 
That they decide that they don't like it. 
 
John Donvan: 
And it's the message from the other side is we don't like to ban things, even though we 
do ban things, it doesn't -- it always smells bad so -- 
 
Vince Percoccio: 
So how did properly craft legislation to do this? 
 
20:11:42  
 
John Donvan: 
Well, can you take on -- can you take on -- you're talking about a slippery slope 
obviously. So take on -- take it on [unintelligible] Buzz Bissinger. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Tim has played football.  He has spoken, I think, very eloquently about why it is a special 
game.  It is a special game.  I love football.  I do not think it has any academic purpose.  
And -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Yeah, but he's asking about all the other sports. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Wait.  Other teams -- but you know, you do it.  You do it.  The University of Chicago 
which was in the Big 10, and Jay Berwanger had won the Heisman trophy six years 
earlier in the Big 10.  Robert Hutchins said, you know what?  This serves absolutely no 
academic purpose, no academic purpose.  And he said, I know a lot of students at my 
school who can win 12 letters but don't know how to write one.  And you know what?  
They got rid of it.  They got rid of it.  Schools can get rid of it.  BU got rid of it.  
Northeastern got rid of it.  Schools get rid of it.   
 
Vince Percoccio: 
Chicago, how do you do it globally for the entire country?  Do you have to have federal 
government come in and say, everybody is banning football programs? 
 
20:12:45  
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Well, people can sue.  They can do this.  They can do that.  I think college presidents get 
-- the problem is with those salaries is they're terrified of head coaches.  They're 
terrified of college coaches.  They know at the big schools, they bring in a lot of bucks.

John Donvan: 
Yeah, but Buzz, you're giving the reasons not to do it. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
You ban it. 
 
John Donvan: 
But what are the reasons -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
You know what you do?  You ban it.  College presidents ban it and then let people sue 
and let -- then it takes -- who knows? 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
Two weeks ago at the University of Florida, they shut down their computer science 
department, and they added $2 million a year to their athletic budget, bringing their -- 
the football program share of that budget to $78 million.  Now, they didn't think of the 
banning of computer science at the University of Florida as setting a dangerous 
precedent. 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Let's hear from the other side. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
So if that's the case, I'm not so worried about the football -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Tim Green. 
 
Tim Green: 
Why can't we -- to Jason's point about freedom, why can't Florida spend their money on 
one thing instead of another?  Why can't the University of Chicago discontinue football 
and focus on academics?   
 
20:13:42 
 
This is -- why can't we choose?  Why can't we choose? And if someone is -- if a football 
program is losing money, and a school wants to discontinue it, well, why don't they?  
Why don't they?  They don't because somewhere along the line some benefit is inuring 
to that university.  And that's why they do it.  And I just don't understand why you'd say, 
well, let's ban it.  If it's so unproductive, if it's so counterproductive to everything that's 
going on, it would ban itself.

  Arlington, VA 22203 

John Donvan: 
Hmm. 
 
[applause] 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
But, you know, it's not going to ban itself because the amount of money that is now 
involved that has been poured in that certainly wasn't there in the '60s by ESPN and CBS 
-- is so enormous that it's just going to create a bigger and bigger monster.  And I guess, 
I don't know, call me silly.  These are difficult times for this country.  We can put our 
head in the sand, and sing the National Anthem, and say everything's going to be great, 
and we can believe in myths, a great country changes.   
 
20:14:48 
 
There was no China in the 1960s that was competing.  There was no India.  There was no 
South Korea.  And, call me naïve, I really do think that these universities have to be 
almost exclusively about education.  And one other thing, you asked about getting rid of 
sports?  I'll tell you why it wouldn't be a bad idea, because then, that's actually the best 
argument for keeping football, you keep football, you keep basketball, you get rid of all 
the other sports that they pay for so that money at least goes into the general fund so 
the average student is getting something out of it. 
 
John Donvan: 
Do you want to add something?  Because he had a long run. 
 
[applause] 
 
Tim Green: 
Well, I mean, that's another debate, whether -- 
 
John Donvan: 
Tim Green. 
 
Tim Green: 
-- we want to ban all non-revenue producing sports.  Again, those are -- create 
opportunities for people, and for men, and for women, and I think universities are about 
opportunities.  
 
20:15:39 
 
And the other thing, I just want to say this because you mentioned something that's 
absolutely wonderful, Buzz, before every football game and before every athletic 
contest at the high school level and in the college level, everyone, everyone, both sides, 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 59 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

we stand up and -- if we don't sing, at least we stand and respectfully observe the Star 
Spangled Banner, this country's song.  And, you know, our National Anthem, what a 
beautiful thing, that's the only place where a community, where an entire school comes 
together and stands up and respects the National Anthem.  You don't do it anywhere 
else in the college experience. 
 
John Donvan: 
Malcolm's not singing it, though.  Sir, question. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Actually, Mr. Bissinger, I did go to the University of Chicago and I did play football there. 
They reinstituted football in 1969 -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
But on a very, very minor, minor scale. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Yes, so it's Division 3. 
 
Male Speaker: 
But they wear a helmet and hit each other. 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Male Speaker: 
And, Mr. Whitlock, I do work on Wall Street as well, so actually I think I had some 
success in my career after graduating from the University of Chicago.   
 
20:16:41 
 
I can tell you this much, the University of Chicago athletes in general, not just football 
but athletes overall, have a higher GPA when I graduated in 2000 than the overall 
student body. So your question, the argument of athletics in education, there is a 
correlation of your education -- 
 
[talking simultaneously] 
 
Male Speaker: 
So the question is this, now, it is also true that Division 1 programs without football, no 
one makes money.  Football programs pay for all the other sports.  So once you ban 
football, how do you pay for women's swimming, how do you pay for every other sport 
there is because there is a correlation between athletics and academics. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 60 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

How do you pay for women's swimming?  The way you pay for a lot of things. 
 
Male Speaker: 
Taxes? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
No, you get a rich benefactor, and there are plenty out there who will pay for the 
program because frankly that's what's happening now.  The next phase of college 
football will be Boone Pickens.  Why is Oklahoma State so good?  Because he's given 
$300 million to the football program.  The University of Oregon, it came out of nowhere 
to be a football power.  Why?  Because of the hundreds of millions given by Phil Knight.  
If you want to have women's swimming, you have a benefactor pay for it.   
 
20:17:42 
 
And you know as well as I do that Chicago is in a very, very different place than the 125 
BCS schools.  There is no question that places like Chicago and Harvard and Wesleyan 
where kids don't think that they're going to be pro football players, the most formidable 
person I have ever met is an athlete because they don't quit.  But you know what the 
problem with athletes are?  You know where they do the best?  Wall Street.  And you 
know why Wall Street is so screwed up?  It’s because athletes -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
-- it's true, athletes don't know when to quit.  They're only about winning. 
 
[applause] 
 
Female Speaker: 
One of the greatest American philosophers, John Dewey, wrote a book called, 
"Democracy in Education," and he discusses the importance of sport in play in the -- 
both K through 12 education as well as the system of American higher education. 
 
20:18:47 
 
And I'm wondering what the side for banning college football would think John Dewey 
would think of the idea of taking sport in play out of the curriculum of American higher 
education when it actually is a really important part of the higher education of an 
individual, whether it's intramural sports or -- I don't know what the level of college 
sports is, but -- 
 
John Donvan: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 61 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

Okay. 
 
Malcolm Gladwell: 
We're not talking about taking sports out of the curriculum.  We're talking about 
banning semi professional -- or -- Buzz might have a slightly different interpretation of 
this than me -- but I think that if you look at schools like for example MIT, which has one 
of the highest participation rates in intramural sports in the country, their level of play is 
far higher than everybody else's, perhaps as a consequence of the fact that they’ve 
turned their backs on big time college sports.   
 
20:19:42 
 
So I think you could -- if we focused on precisely what John Dewey was interested in 
doing, which is bringing sports down to the level of the average -- the ordinary student, 
then that would be more easily achieved if we got away from this preoccupation with 
these enormously costly and dangerous spectacles. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
And just to clarify, I mean, you could have -- people might not like it -- you could have 
wonderful club sports that could be very, very competitive.  I mean, you can have a 
schedule.  The amount of travel the teams do is ridiculous.  You can have a schedule 
where you’re competing against regional teams.  I think John Dewey was talking about 
the development of the whole individual.  The fact is, there’s no phys-ed anymore in 
schools. Everything is about and by and for the athlete.  And what happens is you create 
the athletic culture. 
 
John Donvan: 
Let me put to the other side.  So the solution of having club sports as opposed to sports 
at the level that you guys played, what would that do? 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
You’re limiting access for a lot of people, so -- 
 
Tim Green: 
You’re not going to have college scholarships for the athletes.   
 
20:20:43 
 
And, I mean, one thing I do want to say, though, is almost this line.  I mean, are we 
talking about banning college football or are we talking about only banning college 
football if it’s Division 1 college football?  Are we talking about Division 3, Division 2 
football?  That’s okay?  But Division 1 -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 62 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

No, because, I mean, I -- 
 
Tim Green: 
No? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
You know, I think the model of Division 2 and Division 3 is better.  I think if you read 
William Bowen’s book, I think it’s called “Game of Play,” it’s a fantastic book based on 
data that he got from the Ivy League and from Duke.  I mean, the one thing he did point 
out, and the little three, he said, “It’s a total fallacy to think that the Ivy League does not 
recruit and does not play games with scholarships and that Williams actually gives more 
athletic preference to athletes than the University of Michigan.”  I think all these 
programs are loss leaders and, you know, look -- 
 
Tim Green: 
You’re saying ban college football -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
I’m advocating -- here’s what I’m -- 
 
Tim Green: 
-- entirely? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
No, but I’m advocating that there are other ways to do it.  Whether it’s a minor league 
season, whether it’s an NFL developmental system, why not the European model?   
 
20:21:44 
 
The European model.  They don’t use their colleges and universities to create soccer 
players.  They have sports academies, they have schools.  They’ve plucked players as 
young as six because they say, “All right, you want to be a soccer player, you’re showing 
talent,” and they go to school there.  And the other thing they do that is smart and 
beneficial is if you’re not going to make it, you’re weeded out early so you learn -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right.  Buzz -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
-- at an early age -- 
 
John Donvan: 
-- because of time -- 
 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 63 -

Buzz Bissinger: 
All right, sorry. 
 
John Donvan: 
Only because of time, I want to give you 15 seconds to respond if you want to. 
 
Tim Green: 
So we’re not going to ban college football, we’re just going to change it?  Because we’re 
going to have colleges that have football teams and some of those players, the players 
who want, get to go and get their education so they still have -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
No, I think we ban college football and then you have a developmental system for those 
who are -- 
 
Tim Green: 
That are -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
-- at the higher echelons of competition.  And for the rest of the schools -- 
 
Tim Green: 
That are called Syracuse University, Texas Longhorns -- 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Yeah, you -- 
 
Tim Green: 
-- Oklahoma Sooners? 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
I mean, you license it out. 
 
Tim Green: 
Okay. 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
You license it out. 
 
Tim Green: 
As long as they can go to school and so those 70 percent that want to get their 
education can get it, I think it’s great.

Buzz Bissinger: 
Yeah, that [inaudible] -- 
 
John Donvan: 
All right, that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared US debate. 
 
[applause] 
 
And remember how you voted at the beginning of the debate.  We’re going to ask you 
to vote again in just a few minutes after the closing statements, which will come 
immediately and be briefly.  Round three, closing statements.  Two minutes each, 
uninterrupted.  Our motion is ban college football, and here to summarize his position 
against the motion, Tim Green, a bestselling author, former Atlanta Falcon, and college 
football hall of famer. 
 
[applause] 
 
Tim Green: 
There is no question that there are problems with college football, as there are 
problems with almost every institution in this country.  But I hope that, after some of 
the things you’ve heard tonight from Jason and from me, people who’ve benefited from 
the education of college -- the education we had on the football field with the 
perseverance, the hard work, the teamwork, the tolerance, and the benefits that 
accrued to us through our education, where we earned the opportunity to get college 
degrees, where -- and sometimes some of the people who get those degrees wouldn’t 
have another way to get them except through football scholarships.   
 
20:24:08 
 
So there are great things.  They unify our communities in many instances.  They unify 
campuses and colleges, and the reason why it’s there is because it is doing good things 
and yes it’s making money and yes the coaches are making money and this is America.  
It’s capitalism, I’m sorry.  Brad Pitt makes $25 million to make a movie.  That’s just our -- 
that’s our society.  So we pay people what the market says we should pay them.  
Football, there are concussions, but there are no studies so far that link that to anything 
other than some isolated instances.   
 
20:24:49 
 
So football -- and it's evolving.  With the equipment and the rules, it can continue to get 
better.  But to end it, to me -- Malcolm Gladwell may be best known for his book called" 
Blink."  And in that book, it says that when you're faced with a crucial decision or any 
decision, just listen to the premise and then give your immediate impression.  So that's 



Intelligence Squared U.S. - 65 -  

Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016 

  Arlington, VA 22203 

what I want to ask you to do tonight.  Think about this.  Think about, are we going to 
ban college football, and in a blink, I think you'll vote that we will not. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Tim Green.  Our motion is "ban college football."  Here to summarize his 
position in support of the motion, Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Price-winning journalist, 
sports columnist for "The Daily Beast" and author of "Friday Night Lights." 
 
[applause] 
 
Buzz Bissinger: 
Look, there's no question, this is a radical solution.   
 
20:25:47 
 
But I think it is called for in what are radical times.  I am surprised that Tim and Jason 
seem not to be affected at all about our lagging academic performance, that we're now 
14th in the world in math and reading and science when we used to be first, that we're 
16th in educational attainment, meaning that other countries are catching up and 
catching up rapidly and exceeding us when we used to be first.  We simply do not have 
time to waste. Universities were set up for a primary academic purpose.  They were not 
set up as sports factories disguised as universities.  And I understand the graduation rate 
is 69 percent.  I think it's ginned up.   
 
20:26:40 
 
I think a lot of players, and I think even Tim would -- he'll admit this to me privately 
afterwards -- a lot of players are pushed through and passed through with no demands 
placed upon him.  And I know the impact.  I did write a book called "Friday Night Lights" 
in which the cornerstone character was a black running back named Boobie Miles.  Now, 
this was high school.  And I saw what happened as many college players are when you 
are treated as a football animal, when you pass -- because the word on the street is -- 
with the professors is, "You better pass that kid or there's going to be trouble."  Boobie 
Miles got no education.  He was a football animal.  He was considered dysfunctional, 
basically an idiot, which he was not.  And I'll tell you, with no education, his life has been 
nothing, nothing but a horrendous hell and a lot of broken dreams that football 
propagates more than any other sport. 
 
20:27:43  
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Buzz Bissinger.  "Ban college football," that is our motion.  Here to argue his 
position against this motion, Jason Whitlock is a national columnist for foxsports.com 
and an All Sports insider and contributor to FOX Sports Radio.

[applause] 
 
Jason Whitlock: 
I want to start where I began by -- Mr. Gladwell, Mr. Bissinger, Malcolm, Buzz, two of 
the brightest minds I have ever encountered.  And I -- when I said that comment about 
them dabbling in sports, it's because most of the time they apply their mind to much 
bigger issues than sports.  And so it's been a worthy debate.  Mr. Gladwell began talking 
about the purpose of schools.  And overall education is about preparing you for life.  
And I think if they had a bit more experience with college football, actual participation, 
and then I don't mean that in any kind of dismissive way.   
 
20:28:48 
 
But it's something you have to experience, because I don't think most people 
understand the educational benefits of college football.  And it's dismissed as a bunch of 
dummies. Brady Hoke, the head football coach at the University of Michigan is a very 
good friend of mine.  He played football at Ball State University.  He had been the head 
coach of Ball State University.  I have watched him up close and personal in this era 
reach kids at Ball State University and San Diego State University and now at the 
University of Michigan, with an entire leadership program and men-building program 
that he and his strength coach implement throughout a player's four and-five-year 
career.  And it helps develop the overall person.  And it helps prepare the athlete for life 
in the real world.   
 
20:29:47 
 
That is a school's purpose.  If we truly understood football and what was transpiring, I 
don't think anyone would argue that it's not part of the academic experience.  It may be 
part of the academic experience that some people don't respect because they don't 
understand it, but trust me, it is a big part of the academic experience.  It's not perfect.  
It can be improved.  It can be more like the Ivy League system.  But there's no way we 
should ban football. 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Jason Whitlock.  Our motion is "ban college football."  And here to 
summarize his position in support of the motion, Malcolm Gladwell, a New Yorker staff 
writer and author of "The Tipping Point."

  Arlington, VA 22203 

The most surprising thing about this debate to me at the send that we only mentioned 
the name Junior Seau twice.  And to my mind, Junior Seau's shadow is cast over this 
whole evening.  Last week he shot himself in the chest.   
 
20:30:44 
 
And he played four years at the University of Southern California, over which I'm 
guessing he was hit in the head about 4,000 times.  He's not the first.  Before Junior 
Seau, there was Dave Duerson, played four years at the University of Notre Dame, 
during which time he was probably hit in the head around 4,000 times.  He wasn't the 
first, either.  Before him, there was Andre Waters.  Shot himself in the head.  Played four 
years at Cheyney University over which time he was probably hit in the time at least 
4,000 times.  I could go on and on and on right down to the captain of the Penn football 
team who hung himself in his room a couple years ago.  Someone did an autopsy on his 
brain.  What did they find?  They found evidence of long-term neurological damage that 
was the result of being hit in the head too many times.  Now, I have sat, and I have 
listened to some -- some of the things that the other side has said have been 
extraordinarily eloquent.  I think some of the things that both Tim and Jason said about 
what this game can do are absolutely true.  It is, in many ways, a beautiful game.   
 
20:31:48 
 
It's a game that teaches all kinds of powerful and fundamental lessons.  It's a game 
that's a central part of our culture.  But at a certain time, I think this debate comes down 
to one thing, and that is you have to look at the collateral damage this game has left in 
its wake. And you have to ask the question, is it time to say, enough? 
 
John Donvan: 
Thank you, Malcolm Gladwell. 
 
[applause] 
 
And that concludes our closing statements.  And now it's time to see which side you feel 
has made the best argument here.  We want to ask you again to go to the key pads at 
your seat to register your vote.  This will be your second vote.  Our motion is, "Ban 
college football."  If you feel that this team presented the stronger argument, press 
number one.  If it's this team, number two.  Decide against.  If you are undecided or 
became undecided, push number three.  And you can ignore the other keys.   
 
20:32:42 
 
And if you press anything by mistake, just correct yourself, and system will lock in your 
last vote.  So we'll have those results in about 140 seconds from now.  And while we're 
waiting for the votes, I just want to ask -- this debate was actually one of our best ever.

And part of it was because they really heard each other.  They didn't agree, but they 
listened to each other.  And that made it a far more interesting debate.  I just want to 
thank them and a round of applause for both [unintelligible]. 
 
[applause] 
 
Also just a little secret.  There was a wager placed in the back room before the debate 
began.  Everybody -- these four guys put up 20 bucks each.  So there is a $40 cash prize 
in it for whoever -- whoever wins this thing.  We want to thank our media partners 
Slate, especially Jacob Weisberg and his exceptional editorial staff.  They've been with 
us all season. 
 
[applause] 
 
And this is our last debate here at the Skirball Center at NYU.   
 
20:33:43 
 
It's been our venue since the fall of 2009.  Thank you to the staff and crew for six great 
seasons here.  We really appreciate it. 
 
[applause] 
 
And I have a very, very short side competition.  I'm going to ask a question.  The first 
person in the audience who can answer this question correctly, you'll have about 15 
seconds, will get two free tickets to the first debate in our next season.  And the 
question is this.  It's football related.  "What does the Heisman trophy have to do with 
the man named Ed Smith, and who was he?" You got it?  Yes.  He was a football player 
and -- sorry? 
 
Male Speaker:

That's on West 67th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, and dates are 
set, and tickets are already on sale.  We're going to be following the presidential 
election particularly closely this fall, and that means we're going to be doing topics like, 
"Super PACS," and "Health Care," and "Taxing the Wealthy."  The motions and debaters 
will be announced this summer.  One other thing, we are very, very delighted to 
announce a new partnership.  It is with the Richard Paul Richmond Center for Business 
Law and Public Policy that's a joint venture of the Columbia Business School and the 
Columbia Law School. The Richmond Center is going to co-sponsor two debates during 
the fall 2012 and spring 2013 season, beginning with an October 24 debate on domestic 
tax policy that will be featuring Glen Hubbard, who is dean of Columbia Business School. 
Glen Hubbard previously served as deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of 
the Treasury and as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors.  And, once again, we 
are partnering this evening with New American Tavern around the corner to host a post 
debate reception at Amity Hall.   
 
20:35:41 
 
That's the locale around the corner, a block away on 3rd Street, between Thompson and 
Sullivan.  Details for that location are in your program, but it's just really literally on the 
other side of this building.  And there you can continue this debate with your fellow 
audience members over complementary appetizers and discounted drinks.  And I'll be 
there along with some of the other members of our staff for a little bit.  We did it last 
time, and it was great.  People just wanted to keep debating the issue with each other.  
So we hope that we'll see you there.  So that's it.  I'm just waiting for the results to 
come.  And here they come, for the $40 cash prize, glory.  All right.  It's all -- and you 
have heard all of the arguments, two teams of two, trying to change your minds 
throughout this debate, "Ban college football."  That is our motion, ban it or not.  Here
