BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Hi, my name is, uh, Bernie Weinraub and I’m the moderator of 

this, uh, panel.  And, um, uh, first of all, I want to say something 

that I’ve wanted to say for many, many years, and that’s to, uh, 

please turn off your cell phones and beepers.  [LAUGHTER]  And 

unwrap all cellophaned items, because, uh, there’s, there are, 

um, microphones all around here.  And, um, this is going to be 

broadcast over, um, NPR.  Um, so we have to sort of unwrap any 

kind of cellophaned items and candy and all that stuff.  Um, and 

it would ruin the mood to hear cellophane.  Um, uh, and I, I’ve 

been asked to have people come down forward, uh, but I guess 

you guys are okay.  Um, I want you guys to, um, get your 

questions ready for the Q&A after the opening statements and not 

to be shy about asking the panel anything, anything that you 

want to ask.  Um, if you want three by five cards to write your 

questions down, um, the ushers will hand them out.  Um, now 

I’m pleased and happy to introduce the man responsible for this 

debate and all the other debates, Robert Rosenkranz, who will 

make some opening remarks.  [APPLAUSE]    

ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 
Well, good evening and thank you all for being here.  I’m Robert

Rosenkranz, Chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate 

Forum, which is an initiative of the Rosenkranz Foundation.  I’m 

here with Donna Wolfe, our Executive Producer, who has, been 

with me from the creation of this series.  This is the fourth debate 

of our, uh, fall season.  There are going to be four more in, in the 

spring and probably an even expanded program next year.  We’re 

thrilled that WNYC is, uh, recording this series of debates, 

producing them as radio programs, which through the good 

offices of NPR, are distributed nationally to a majority of the 

largest radio markets in the country.  Um, we also value the 

sponsorship of The Times of London and I especially want to 

thank our moderator, Bernie Weinraub, who I will formally 

introduce momentarily, as well as the extraordinarily able group 

of panelists who are the true stars of tonight’s evening.  Let me 

begin by saying what’s to, what tonight’s debate is not.  It is not, 

Resolved:  Movies Should Be Censored and Their Export 

Restricted.  It is not, Resolved:  George W. Bush Has Fueled Anti-

Americanism Abroad.  Rather, it’s about the connection of two 

pretty clearly indisputable facts.  First, that the American 

entertainment industry, Hollywood, has been highly successful in 

creating a product with deep appeal for a global audience.  Those, 

like myself, who have a commitment to free markets and free 

expression would be hard put not to say, Two cheers for 

Hollywood.  But why not three cheers?  Well, because billions of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad Page 3. 

 
 
 

people around the world get their primary impressions of 

American life and culture from our movies and television shows, 

which leads us to a second indisputable fact -- a rising tide of 

anti-American sentiment, particularly in Europe and the Middle 

East.   It’s challenging for us as Americans to understand why the 

world so often views us differently from the way we view 

ourselves.  With that in mind, the motion tonight is intended to 

explore what relationship exists, if any, between these two 

phenomenon.  Content aside, is Hollywood’s dominance of global 

entertainment perceived as a hated form of cultural imperialism?  

Does the content of Hollywood films and television, taken as a 

whole, reflect a distorted picture of American life?  And does this 

picture matter in terms of the rise of anti-American sentiment?  

Well, let’s see what the evidence shows.  I’d now like to introduce 

our moderator for the evening, Bernard Weinraub.  Bernie 

became, began as a copy boy at The New York Times, served 

abroad for The Times in Saigon, London, New Delhi and 

Washington.  In 1990 he moved to Los Angeles, where he’s been 

covering Hollywood for The New York Times until his retirement 

about a year ago.  Uh, he recently wrote a play, The Accomplice, 

which will open in New York in March 2007.  So I’m happy to be 

able to plug that.  And I’m very pleased now to, uh, hand the 

evening over to Bernie.  [APPLAUSE]

BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Thank you.  Thank you.  The one, um, thing that I’ve been told 

that I forgot in the introduction is, um, because we’re going to be 

on, on NPR, um, we’ve gotta sort of, I guess, fake it a little bit and 

we have to a lou…a loud round of applause for NPR and for the 

radio broadcast.  [LAUGHTER]  So, please, a round of applause.  

[APPLAUSE]   

 MAN  
All right, whoo.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Great.  Um, let me give you a brief rundown of the evening.  First, 

the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of 

the argument.  The opposition will follow.  Each person will get a 

maximum of eight minutes and we’ll go and back from one side to 

the other.  When all six speakers are finished with their opening 

remarks I’ll open the floor to brief questions from the audience.  

Third, when the Q&A is complete each debater will make a final 

statement lasting not more than two minutes each.  Fourth, 

during the closing arguments ballot boxes will be passed around 

for voting and you’ll put in either the for piece, the against, the 

against piece or the whole ticket if you still don’t know which side 

you favor.  If anyone doesn’t have a ticket ballot an usher will get 

you one at the appropriate moment.  [CLEARS THROAT]  Fifth 

and last, after the clo…after the final closing argument is made, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad Page 5. 

 
 
 

uh, statement is made, I will announce the results of the 

audience vote and tell you which side carried the day.  

[00:07:17:13]  I will now introduce the panel.  For the motion, 

which is, "Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad" – 

author, commentator, news ana…analyst and law professor, 

James Hirsen.  [APPLAUSE]  Now, I’m, I’m going to break my 

impartiality here -- and I’m not going to do this with anybody else 

-- except to say that James Hirsen, whom I do not know, has a 

very unusual sidelight to his background.  [SOMEONE 

CHUCKLES]  Because prior to him becoming, you know, uh, very 

prominent on FOX News and all that stuff, um, he worked as a 

pro…professional musician and for a number of years was a 

keyboardist for one of the most legendary groups of all times, and 

one of my favorites – and, uh, it goes way back – The 

Temptations. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]  So… 

 MAN  
All right.    

BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Okay, that’s the big surprise of the evening.  [LAUGHTER]  Next, 

um, the art critic, essayist, social commentator and co-editor and 

publisher of The New Criterion, Roger Kimball.  [APPLAUSE]   

Resident Scholar at the American Ent…Enterprise Institute for 

Public Policy Research, Joshua Muravchick.  [APPLAUSE]  

Against the motion, the Executive Director of The Creative

Coalition, a social and political ad…advocacy organization for the

film producer, director and political activist, Robert Greenwald.  

[APPLAUSE]  And writer of fiction, non-fiction and screenplays 

and Chairman of the Graduate Program in Screenwriting at 

UCLA, Richard Walter.  [APPLAUSE]  Um, now for the motion, 

um, let’s call up Roger Kimball.  [APPLAUSE]   [PAUSE]   

ROGER KIMBALL  
Good evening.  I’d like to, uh, thank Mr. Weinraub and Bob 

Rosenkranz, uh, Dana and all the IQ staff, IQ2 staff, um, for 

organizing this event and keeping alive the tradition of civil 

discourse and debate in New York.  Um, it’s, it’s a tradition that 

is, uh, unfortunately, uh, fallen out of favor in recent years.  Um, 

now, contemplating the motion before us, that Hollywood has 

fueled anti-Americanism abroad, I have to admit that when I first 

contemplated this I thought of the cartoon strip Calvin and 

Hobbs.  Maybe some of you know this strip.  I’m thinking in 

particular of that, that, uh, cartoon whose first frame shows the 

little Calvin – he’s six years old, quite a demon – hammering, 

furiously, nails into a board.  And then in the second frame 

Calvin’s mother runs into the room, screaming, Calvin, what are 

you doing to the coffee table?  In the third frame, Calvin looks up 

with a look of extreme bemusement on his face, saying, Is that a 

trick question?  [AUDIENCE RESPONSE]  Now, we all know that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad Page 7. 

 
 
 

Hollywood in its current incarnation, uh, boasts a, a large 

quotient of anti-Americanism.  Uh, the names Matt Damon, 

George Clooney, Alec Baldwin, Barbra Streisand, Michael Moore, 

Susan, Susan, Susan Sarandon – the, the list goes on and on.  

We also know that anti-Americanism is alive and well in the world 

today, alas.  Now, what is the connection?  I want to be clear 

about what the resolution before us – a resolution, by the way, 

that I, I hope you will support.  It is that Hollywood has fueled 

anti-Americanism abroad.  This is, this is where it gets tricky.  

This is not a referendum about the Bush Administration, the war 

in Iraq or any, uh, evils, real or supposed, of American society.  It 

is a resolution about the effect of Hollywood movies and the 

Hollywood mindset on this phenomenon of anti-Americanism 

abroad.  Now, the first thing to note is that anti-Americanism is 

what we might call a hearty perennial.  It does not need 

Hollywood to thrive.  It has a long pedigree, born of wealth and 

power.  One thinks of Pericles and what he had to say about, uh, 

the way in which distinction bred envy, envy bred resentment and 

resentment, if not checked, bred hatred.  Athens, in her day, was 

cordially hated.  Rome, in her day, was cordially hated.  So was 

the British Empire.  As the authors of that great satire, 1066 and 

All That, reminded, remind us, after the first World War America 

emerged as what they called top nation.  So it, it assumed the 

mantle of Great Britain’s, uh, pre-eminence and it also has 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad Page 8. 

 
 
 

passed the scepter, uh, as it were, of the world’s antipathy.  And 

that has been something that’s been pretty constant from that 

time on.  There have been intervening moments of gratitude, after 

1918, for example, after 1945, for example.  But basically then 

the world slips back into disliking us.  Um, so that’s, that’s no, 

uh, just a kind of common reality which we,  which we live with.  

That’s one form of anti-Americanism.  In our, in the current form, 

anti-Americanism, I think, was born domestically of the Sixties.  

It’s a product in part of what the literary critic Lionel Trilling 

called the adversary culture of the intellectuals – um, fed by the 

Vietnam War, fed by the radicalism of the Sixties.  We all can 

remember the students demonstrating in the street, spelling 

America with a K and so on.  Um, something more radical 

happened abroad.  But this is not new either.  You go back to the 

Carter years.  There are plenty of people chanting in the streets, 

down with the great Satan, death to America, burning American 

flags.  Same thing in the Reagan administration, same thing in 

the Clinton administration.  The same thing in both Bush 

administrations.  Hoards shouting “Death to America” is always, 

seems always to be with us.  So anti-Americanism, domestic and 

foreign, is like a, a kind of rank garden.  It thrives.  Hollywood 

merely supplies a layer of what you might call fructified, fructified 

manure.  Anti-Americanism abroad would exist without 

Hollywood, just as cancer would exist without cigarette smoke.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad Page 9. 

 
 
 

But Hollywood tends to make the malignancy worse.  And it does 

this I think in two ways.  One way is what we might call cultural 

anti-Americanism.  By making so many trashy, vacuous movies, 

Hollywood uh, fosters a view of American life that is really at odds 

with the reality of American society.  It um, shows this society to 

be largely sex-obsessed, violence-obsessed, a society shot through 

with cynicism about its founding institutions.  And by and large 

portrays a decadent society in love with nihilism.  That’s one way 

in which Hollywood fuels anti-Americanism abroad, by portraying 

America as a society that has lost its soul.   

 

Another way and perhaps a more virulent way, a more political 

way, is the way Hollywood, by attacking those institutions of 

American life uh, shows America to be a bankrupt, corrupt, 

venal, savage uh, mercenary society.  Um these, this side of 

Hollywood really sort of took off I think in the 1960s during the 

Vietnam War.  Is there a Vietnam film uh, that shows America as 

anything other than a horrible, savage, misguided society?  

Maybe one or two.  One thinks of the Hanoi Hilton but of course 

that was instantly savaged by critics.  Stanley Kaufman, for 

example, dismissed it as filth.  By and large I think any movie 

that deals with American society from the 1960s on deals with all 

of the institutions of American life as something not to be 

admired but to be disparaged.  When was the last time you saw 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 10. 

 
 
 

the president of the United States in a movie portrayed in a 

favorable light, or the military?  It’s very rare that this happens.  

Oliver Stone, I think summed up what, what Hollywood is like 

now when he says “We have become the enemy.”  Hollywood has 

fueled anti-Americanism abroad to such an extent that for 

example, German schoolteachers show Bowling for Columbine by 

Michael Moore as an accurate portrayal of American society.  One 

thinks, for example, of the movie Syriana which blends 

incomprehensibility with anti-American animists to an 

extraordinary extent.  Charles Krauthammer said that this movie 

could have been scripted by Osama Bin Laden and I believe that 

movies like this, that the general spirit of Hollywood today 

actively fuels anti-Americanism abroad.  And I hope that you will 

support that motion.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Okay, against, we have Richard Walter.   

RICHARD WALTER 
Thank you.  You hear it all the time: Hollywood films are 

corrosive, destructive, decaying.  You hear it all, all the time.  You 

hear it from our noble opponents here and you hear it in right-

wing talk radio shows.  I guess that’s a redundancy if ever there 

was one.  Um I just wonder if it, it worries our friends even just a 

little bit to find themselves in lock step agreement with Osama 

Bin Laden.  The fact of the matter is there are a lot of bad movies 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 11. 

 
 
 

out there.  There are also a lot of bad paintings, a lot of bad 

sculpture.  You know, most art sucks, excuse me.  But here in 

New York, I stopped in at the Metropolitan Museum, my favorite 

museum in the world.  And I didn’t see one work of art that 

wasn’t worthy.  And you get the impression in museums that all 

art is fantastic, is beautiful, is wonderful.    When in fact, for 

every one of those paintings at the museums, there are 

thousands, indeed tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of 

thousands that just don’t deserve to be there.  With film, because 

it’s contemporary, even more so in, in television, with television, 

we don’t have the time to do the culling and the selecting where 

the best kind of falls away, drops away.  People like to look back 

at the forties and the thirties and say, why don’t they make great 

films like they did back then?  The fact is they made a lot of lousy 

movies back then as well.  I think in 2060 they’ll be saying, why 

don’t they make great films like they did back there at the 

beginning of the new millennium?  We hear about sex and 

violence in films as if this was invented by Hollywood.  The fact is, 

dramatic narrative has always been brutal, always been ugly, 

always been bloody and sexual.  Oedipus Rex, he kills his father.  

You know what he does to his mother.  He pokes his eyes out 

with jagged, rusty spikes.  Medea murders her own children in a 

jealous rage against her philandering and faithless husband 

Jason.  Uh, not just the Greeks but Shakespeare.  I'm talking 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 12. 

 
 
 

now about the greatest, most venerated, most honorable, the 

most loved dramatic expression of all time.  Hamlet ends up with 

nine corpses on the stage.  We counted them up in class.  Some 

of them had been run through on swords, some of them had been 

poisoned.  Macbeth kills his own king who is a guest in his 

house, and he does it out of pure ambition, out of pure greed.  

Richard III killed his own nephews who were boys, nine and 

eleven years old.  Um, this was not invented by eleven Jews at 

Paramount Studios a couple of weeks ago last Thursday.  This is 

the way dramatic uh, expression operates.  It’s all about conflict, 

and uh, you know nobody wants to see the village of the happy 

nice people.  Rational discourse, even handed discussion has its 

place, for example right here.  But art is not it.  Certainly 

dramatic art is, is not it.   

 

Now what you hear about Hollywood all the time is crass 

commercialism, all they care about is, is making money.  Oh 

Hollywood just obsesses about the bottom line.  Now, Hollywood 

care about the bottom line?  Of course it does, but what business 

doesn’t?  That’s not unique to the entertainment business.  The 

dry cleaner at the corner has to make the bottom line.  The 

insurance business has to meet the bottom line, manufacturing, 

uh, construction.  If you don’t make the bottom line, you're out of 

business.  Everything stands on the bottom line, that’s why it’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 13. 

 
 
 

called the bottom line.  And Hollywood’s interest in the bottom 

line is no different from any other business enterprise.  And it’s 

interesting to me that people who consider themselves 

conservatives and very pro-business, not what I believe is 

America’s greatest business, which is information and 

entertainment, which is what I mean when we talk metaphorically 

about this thing uh, called Hollywood.  So really there is, there’s 

absolutely nothing unique to that.  I think what the problem is 

has a lot to do with the fact that we are so now inundated with 

images.  We see so much media everywhere you go, even a man at 

a urinal, excuse me again, will see advertising.  I’ve even seen 

digital screens.  Um, a guy my age has plenty of time, let me tell 

you [LAUGHTER] to look at all of that stuff.  And we can’t tell any 

longer the difference between what’s real and what’s not.  There’s 

no more East and West.  You go to Beijing and you can be in, in 

uh, you know, at Banana Republic and J. Crew.  There’s no more 

men and women, that is to say, women do what men used to do 

and vice versa.  Uh, no more renters and landlords.  I know there 

are but in another generation it was, it, it, it was like that.  Now it 

really, for many of us, maybe most of us in this room, it is not.  I 

think people can’t tell the difference any longer between images 

and the actual things that the images represent.  I was 

approached by a boxing, the management for a boxer, a very 

famous prizefighter.  It doesn’t matter who it is, his initials are 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 14. 

 
 
 

Evander Holyfield.  [LAUGHTER]  And they wanted him to move 

into an acting career and they were looking for material because I 

see a lot of new screenplays by a lot of new writers.  And they 

wanted, they warned me though, they cautioned me that he 

considers himself a very religious man and a role model for young 

men and therefore he refuses to be seen in a movie that depicts 

him as causing damage, as causing harm to anybody.  A 

prizefighter.  I mean he’s made, he’s made his living, he’s 

achieved his fame, he has a management team that’s able to 

approach the professor because he has literally beat men into 

unconsciousness with his fist.  And this is not a diatribe against 

the fight game.  God forgive me, I love a great prizefight.  In Los 

Angeles, it’s now impossible to, it’s illegal to own a lookalike 

replica handgun.  You can’t tell if it’s real or not.  It could be used 

in a crime.  A real one that can actually blow your brains out is 

absolutely legal.  I, I hold this up to you as an example of how 

people no longer can tell the difference between symbols of things 

and the things that these symbols represent.   

 

And likewise, lets look to anti-American sentiment abroad.  What 

could be causing that?  It couldn't be the ruinous policies of this 

recent administration.  It’s got to be Hollywood movies.  So much 

easier to, to believe that.  I must tell you I’ve traveled all around 

the world, I'm privileged to travel all the world and, and to lecture 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 15. 

 
 
 

on screen writing issues and talk to film development 

corporations.  And we are very much loved all around the world.  

I had the privilege of teaching Masters classes last spring in Paris 

and London and imagine my good fortune that I could stand in 

front of you and actually truthfully pronounce that, that sentence 

to you.  And in the lobby of the conservatoire in Paris, there are 

two dozen posters of movies all around the room.  And this is in 

mean old America-loathing France.  And twenty-one of the movies 

are Hollywood movies, are American films.  Only three of them 

were French films.  The truth is we are loved all around the world 

for our, our film.  The films show that we’re an open society.  Do 

we want to go back as Jim suggested in the piece that I read to 

the good ol’ days when everybody was white and women knew 

their place?  I don't think so.  Thank you very, very much.  

[APPLAUSE]  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Okay, now for the motion, Joshua Muravchick.  [APPLAUSE] 

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
I was going to tell you a great joke to start off with but there’s not 

enough time, so just laugh please. [LAUGHTER]  I want, I'm going 

to start off with a movie that I enjoyed very much and that made 

me laugh a lot, uh forty ideas ago.  But I think it symbolizes a 

great deal of the problem which we’re speaking about, and that 

was the movie Dr. Strangelove.  The thesis of that movie was that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 16. 

 
 
 

the American nuclear arms and American armament in general 

was not driven by any real danger to our country but was rather 

driven by the militarism, chauvinism, paranoia of American 

officials, even with some bizarre root or connection in Nazi 

Germany.  And this film in fact symbolized a thesis about the 

Cold War and America’s role in it that was believed by many 

Americans, but even more by foreigners, and that was propagated 

again and again by Hollywood films, namely that the two parties 

to the Cold War were equally guilty, equally afraid of one another.  

They were like two scorpions in a bottle.  Unlike most historical 

interpretations, this was one where we’re able to find out at the 

end the truth of falsity.  That is, we found out it was utterly false.  

We found this out in 1989 when there came to the fore in the 

Soviet Union a ruler, Gorbachev, who no longer wanted to wage 

Cold War against United States.  And the moment that he 

stepped forward and was prepared to solve the issues of which we 

were at odds and to uh, and to stop being competitors, the Cold 

War ended instantly because it never was an equally two sided 

war.  It was a war of offense on the other side, aggression on one 

side and, and defense on the other.  A uh, a point that was 

consistently misrepresented by Hollywood.   

 

Still worse than that kind of moral equivalence that you could see 

again and again in films were people who, whom there were many 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 17. 

 
 
 

in Hollywood.  And uh, whose ideas were represented in many 

films, that said in fact, we were the bad guys.  And the good guys 

in the Cold War were the Uncle Joe Stalin and the Soviet Union 

and his heirs, the emblematic figure of this view of the world was 

Lillian Hellman, who was a Communist but pretended not to be.  

And who uh, and who in fact even once, wrote a film called Song 

of Russia.  And the film Song of Russia, Mr. Walter, was exactly a 

film portraying a village of the happy nice people.  Except this 

village of the happy nice people was a collective farm which in fact 

in reality was a form of uh, death dealing slave labor.  But 

brought to the screen in Hollywood as a kind of a, a Brady Bunch 

lifestyle, speaking Russian.  This, but Hellman was far from alone 

in this.  In fact the view that supported the other side in the Cold 

War was widespread in Hollywood.  And in fact, a subsequent 

mythology was created and is perpetuated to this day by 

Hollywood about the reaction against this support for the other 

side in the Cold War.  That is, we hear a lot about and we still to 

this day, hear about the Hollywood Ten who have been presented 

in one after another Hollywood film over the decades, including 

this decade as ten idealistic, humanitarian liberals who were 

persecuted by the authoritarian state of the United States with 

the consistent obfuscation or outright denial of the now 

documented fact that all ten of these Hollywood Ten were 

Communist Party members, and were themselves engaged in a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 18. 

 
 
 

collective effort to blacklist and suppress people who were anti-

Communist and prevent them from advancing their careers in 

Hollywood.  

 

But you don’t have to love Stalin to hate America, and in a later 

era we got people who made famous and popular Hollywood films 

that hated America without loving Stalin, of whom the 

emblematic example is Oliver Stone, who created these various 

films of paranoid fantasies, purported to be actual history.  And, 

and one of which the murder of President Kennedy was a coup 

plotted by Vice President Johnson, and another which has 

implied that the murder of President Kennedy was in fact carried 

out by President Nixon or inspired by President Nixon.  

Elsewhere, Mr. Stone has told us that the murder of the 

President’s brother, Robert Kennedy, was carried out by the FBI.  

And when you look around the world and see in places like the 

Middle East the kind of paranoid, bizarre theories about 9/11 or 

other things that go on in the world, these are things that I think 

in all likelihood are fed and encouraged by these very popular 

presentations in American films, by the likes of Oliver Stone, 

which in fact are just as far fetched as the theory that four 

thousand Jews didn’t show up to work at the World Trade Center 

on 9/11.  As I said, Mr. Stone parades as if he’s a historian.  

Other Hollywood film makers are much more modest and don’t 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 19. 

 
 
 

pretend to be making anything other than entertainment.   And 

yet if you watch the uh, the thriller genre in recent years, you see 

that there’s a kind of set pattern that reappears again and again 

and again.  That is, well as you go along in the film and you find 

out who is the real evil force at the inner sanctum behind the bad 

guys in the film, it is invariably the CIA.  The Pentagon, the 

President, some aide to the President, or American multinational 

corporations.  This uh, uh, this uh, current, this genre being 

epitomized recently by Syriana that was referred to.  But I think 

the best representation of that is by the remake of The 

Manchurian Candidate.  Manchurian Candidate was a film in the 

fifties which showed someone being manipulated and 

brainwashed and used for diabolical purposes by the government 

of Communist China, of Mao Zedong.  In the twenty-first century 

version of The Manchurian Candidate, it’s no more Mao Zedong, 

it’s some multinational corporation vaguely reminiscent of uh, 

Halliburton or the Carlyle Group.  So here we have a new 

sensibility, that is on the one hand, we have this evil Halliburton, 

Carlyle, whatever people who have actually done such terrible 

things as gouging on contracts that they have fulfilled with the 

US government.  And clearly this is supposed to be more horrible 

to us now in our new modern sensibility than the government of 

China of Mao Zedong.

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Josh, it’s time.   

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
I didn’t hear you say one minute.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
I said one minute before.   

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
Um, alright my, I'm sorry I didn’t hear you.  My closing had to do 

with the clown prince of anti-Americanism, Michael Moore.  But 

I’ll save it for the question period.  [APPLAUSE]  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
I said one.  Um, okay against is Robin Bronk.  [APPLAUSE]  

ROBIN BRONK 
I wanted to take ten seconds of my time for a nod to my esteemed 

colleague, Mr. Kimball for the ex-, due expression that I hope that 

we can all take with us, fructifying manure.  And I will try and 

use it in every one of my speeches.   Has Hollywood fueled anti-

Americanism abroad?  Where’s the evidence that we should be 

asking this question at all?  Yes, there’s a lot of anti-

Americanism, yes Hollywood exists.  But where’s the connection?  

What’s the cause and effect?  We have the peoples, we have 

people’s responses to why they’ve become anti-American in the 

past few years.  None of them mention Hollywood.  What’s the 

problem with the data?  Now if you were to posit Hollywood as the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 21. 

 
 
 

problem, even though there is no data to support this thesis, 

what would be the tipping point?  In other words, Hollywood has 

been around since the early twentieth century.  Anti-Americanism 

has peaked in recent years.   And in a way we last saw during the 

Vietnam War.  Would anyone wish to argue that Hollywood has 

fundamentally changed in the past six years?  What films would 

you point to, to support the contention?  Well if you didn’t like 

Fahrenheit 911, what about Flight 92 and the spade of extremely 

patriotic movies that have recently come out?  Men of Honor, 

Thirteen Days, Saving Private Ryan, Patriot.  Well of course 

Hollywood releases lots of different kinds of films.  But where has 

any reputable study anywhere found a direct tie between the 

kinds of films being produced at the given moment and a rising 

anti-American sentiment around the world?  In fact, the opposite 

appears true.   Hollywood is frequently what appeals to foreigners 

about America, even those who detest our foreign policy.  It’s 

called show business.  Hollywood Studios are owned by global 

multinational conglomerates whose goal is to maximize their 

shareholder value.  They do this by trying to produce a product, a 

product that will appeal to the widest possible audience.  To do 

this, they must do their respective best to appeal to the most 

broad marketplace, here and abroad.  And unless you believe that 

Hollywood is run by a conspiracy, then all Hollywood is doing is 

reflecting the values of the people to whom it seeks to appeal.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 22. 

 
 
 

 

Now if you would argue, again, absent any data or evidence of any 

kind, that this somehow increases the incidence of anti-

Americanism, then what you're really arguing is that American 

values and the values of the global marketplace are the cause of 

anti-Americanism.  And if that’s the case, and I would contend 

that it’s not, then you're really objecting both to capitalism itself 

and to the way that Americans like to think of themselves as 

citizens and consumers.  That sounds kind of anti-American to 

me, and moreover, it sounds like you're shooting the messenger.  

In America against the world, how we are different and why we 

are disliked, based on ninety-one thousand interviews conducted 

in fifty nations from 2002 to 2005 by the Pew Research Center, 

the authors write that “while the first hints that the world was 

becoming troubled by America came soon after the election of 

George W. Bush, and that whatever global goodwill the United 

States has in the wake of the September 11th attacks appears to 

have quickly dissipated after the Iraq invasion.  Favorable 

opinions had more than slipped.  They had plummeted.”  And it’s 

grown worse since May when that was published.  The most 

recent Pew finding showed that favorable opinions of the US had 

gone from eighty-three percent in 2000 to fifty-six percent in 2006 

in Britain, seventy-eight to thirty-seven in Germany, sixty-two to 

thirty nine in France.  When one looks at the results of these 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 23. 

 
 
 

surveys, you see tremendous international opposition to the War 

in Iraq and America’s policies on global warming.  If you speak 

with foreign leaders, you hear genuine concerns about specific 

aspects of US foreign policy, the refusal to agree with the Kyoto 

Treaty and global warming.  The withdrawal from the 

International Criminal Court, the War in Iraq, difficulty getting 

visas to visit the United States.  Perhaps I'm looking at the wrong 

polls or talking with the wrong foreigners.  But I’ve yet to hear 

anyone mention Everybody Loves Raymond reruns as the fuel 

feeding the anti-American fire raging across so much of the globe.  

And that’s leading the whole world to, I was going to say that 

word but I guess I can’t say that word since this is on NPR but 

that’s a different uh, subject.  Taking to that place down below in 

a hand basket.  [APPLAUSE]   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Thank you.  Okay now um, for, we have James Hirsen.   

JAMES HIRSEN 
Now that Pew Poll that uh, was cited by Robin, uh, I have to say 

has some statistical problems because in terms of France, 

Germany, and Britain, they over-sampled the Muslim population, 

sampling them at levels close to fifty percent.  And that accounts 

a great, for a great deal of the change.  When considering this 

motion, whether you're going to support it, the real question is 

whether the America that you see in the generic Hollywood that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 24. 

 
 
 

constitutes television shows and movies and music, is the same 

America that we all live in and work in.  I mean what if your only 

glimpse of the United States was the latest report of Britney 

Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton and their boycott of 

underpants?  Um in nations around the globe, there are lots of 

people who have never been to the United States.  Now Richard 

Walter has traveled the world and he said he was privileged to do 

so, but there’s lots of people that have not.  And they’ve never 

come here, they’ve never met you.  And so their only impression 

is the export of the pop culture by the Hollywood community.  

And that includes all of this product.  It includes television, and 

music, and movies.  Uh, an appearance on The View by Danny 

DeVito.  And once upon a time, as Richard Walter alluded to 

talking about the thirties and forties in Hollywood, there’s a 

nickname for this, it’s called a Golden Age.  It’s for a reason 

because iconic images were sent around the world, images of 

Henry Fonda, images of Clark Gable, images of John Wayne.  And 

the world fell in love with America, and they fell in love with those 

Hollywood images.  And there was a, a set of values.  There was 

optimism and there was courage.  And there was unshakable 

belief in freedom, and unshakable belief in fairness.  To, to show 

you how much it shifted um, in the period, is it, John Wayne who 

was made into the symbol of America by director John Ford, the 

cowboy was rugged and independent and gallant and true.  We 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 25. 

 
 
 

move forward to 1969 when the first film that was X-rated wins 

the best picture.  Uses the name cowboy, it’s Midnight Cowboy.  

And here the cowboy’s profession is relegated to that of a male 

prostitute.  The cowboys uh, follow in the long way.  But things 

continued in what Roger Kimball called the cultural anti-

Americanism.  Since the 1960s, that what people see around the 

world is an America of extreme violence, of rampant crime, of 

unapologetic narcissism, of licentious exhibitionism, and self-

loathing.  And this is misshapen.  It’s distorted.  It’s a place where 

even Tony Soprano would run to his therapist.  And look at rap 

lyrics.  I mean rap lyrics…not all of it, but a lot of it, have themes 

of assaulting women, dealing drugs, killing the police.   In many 

cases—well, actually, almost all cases—women are described 

either as female dogs, or garden utensils.  [LAUGHTER]  And 

the—and the export of this pop culture has increased.  Um, 

multiplexes were built in Europe, and, uh, the, the exports have 

gone up to a level of 40—to 50 percent of film box office, is on 

foreign shores.   That includes the films that my colleagues 

brought up, uh, Syriana and Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11 

which has been very popular in the Afghan case.   Um, America’s 

recent film exports, though, took the idea of artistic license in 

relation to violent scenes to a whole new level.  We have a whole 

new genre of films that are doing big box office abroad, and they 

deal with nothing but…sadistic, senseless, sickening torture.   I’m 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 26. 

 
 
 

talking about films like Hostel,  which did $33 million abroad, the 

Saw series, there’s three of them, they did $160 million abroad.  

These films, Hostel’s plot is a group of young people who are 

traveling, who are taken prisoner by an organization that allows 

businessmen to torture and kill for entertainment.   There’s no 

plot.  And they lead our neighbors abroad to believe, that America 

is deviant, and despicable and violent.  It’s no wonder that, we 

have, uh, heard this nickname of Israel as “the little Satan” by 

some of the people we’re fighting against, and they call us “the 

great Satan.”   As a matter of fact, uh, Robin referred to 

studies…this isn’t a poll but it certainly is an event when, right 

after 9/11 one month later, angry mobs went to the local 

cinemas, and burnt down five of them that contained American 

films.  I guess they gave it a thumbs-down.   The, uh…the, the 

other aspect of Hollywood that’s very disturbing, is the way 

representatives of free enterprise are depicted.  Business people, 

executives, and corporations.  Um, you know, I—I would expect 

that in a town that, that writes scripts that every once in a while 

we’d see, uh, a corporate executive as a villain.   But it’s almost 

always that way.  Oliver Stone made Wall Street, named his main 

character Gekko, and he extolled the virtues of greed.  In Syriana, 

as, um…you know, uh, my colleagues have brought up, which, by 

the way, George Clooney used the Charlize Theron formula to win 

an Oscar.  That’s you pack up the—pack on the pounds and then 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 27. 

 
 
 

pick up an Oscar.  And in, in that film, there’s a business 

executive with a suit that explains anti-Americanism.  Explains 

the reason America is successful, he says, “Corruption is why we 

win.”   Hollywood hasn’t even left their remakes alone.  When they 

remade The Fugitive, all of a sudden they have to have a 

pharmaceutical corporate as a co-conspirator with the one-armed 

man that was not in the original television show.   Uh, my 

colleague, uh, Josh brought up The Manchurian Candidate.  

Which inexplicably changed the villainous totalitarian 

government, into a corporation.  The Manchurian Corporation, 

what do they manufacture?   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
One minute.   

JAMES HIRSEN 
So apparently in Hollywood wealth is taken for granted, it’s a 

zero-sum game, a finite pie, where if one person wins, then 

another loses.  Uh, last year, there was a remake of a famous 

American symbol.  Superman.  And Superman has always been 

associated with the phrase, “Truth, justice, and the American 

way.”   And if you went to the film, you noticed, there was no 

American way, or it was taken out.  And maybe that’s because, 

Hollywood has manufactured a new American way that does not 

fit with either truth, or justice.  [APPLAUSE]  



Media Transcripts, Inc.

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Okay, and Robert Greenwald.  [APPLAUSE]    

ROBERT GREENWALD 
Thank you.  Somehow it seems that, um… our panelists, some of 

our panelists have the notion, that the only America people 

around the world see, is the one in movies and television.  Do 

they truly believe, that these people all over the world are idiots 

and morons, who have no idea what is going on with this horrific 

war?   Do they really believe that over and over again it’s a 

Hollywood movie, rather than the killings, the terrorism, the 

bombings…the friends, the relatives, the relatives that people 

know, who are being…subjected…and dying in this horrific 

situation?   Do they really think that an hour in front of a TV set 

counters all of the news, and all of the TV reports, and all of the 

paper reports?  Truly hard for me to imagine.  Does Josh really 

think that the war that he advocated for has less of an effect on 

people than watching a movie?   Or that if we follow his lead and 

go to war with Iran, that that will in any way…any way do 

anything but continue to destroy the country that we love?  The 

country that Oliver Stone loves?  The country that Michael Moore 

loves?   The people in the community in Los Angeles who love, we 

may disagree with them, but the notion that we say they hate 

America, is one I personally find disgusting.  Let me go back to 

9/11 for a minute.  We all remember…I was not in New York, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 29. 

 
 
 

many of you were here, the terrible time, the tragedy.   And then 

this amazing, amazing outpouring, around the world.  Embracing 

us.  Supporting us.  Offering help to us.  The spectrum of 

countries who came forward and wanted to be with us at this 

time was truly something to behold.   We know it from the 

information, we know it from the news sources, people I’m sure 

here have individual stories, when you would call somebody from 

another country and what they would say and how they would 

reach out to us.   And then that changed, right?  And then to use 

the Pew study which we can argue about endlessly but I think 

you’re totally wrong on the over-sampling issue.  To use the Pew 

study again we saw, after the Iraq war, a big drop, right?  Turkey 

went from 52% of the country supporting us to 12%.   Britain, 

our ally, 83% to 56%.  And Jordan from 20% to 1% had 

supported us, and now, over a period of years were no longer.  

Well, I’m absolutely sure that the reason for that was Ocean’s 11.  

[LAUGHTER]  That’s exactly the reason, or maybe it was Shrek, 

no, I think maybe it was Shrek, that caused that terrible fall-off to 

happen.   That really would explain the statistical drop, right?  I 

mean, it makes perfect sense.   This was a war of choice…that 

our country went into.  The world was opposed to us in the 

world—in this war of choice.  Now people can argue we still 

should’ve done it.   But we know the world was opposed to this 

war of choice.  We invaded, we went in, we occupied a country in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 30. 

 
 
 

the Middle East with oil resources.  And now, Pew study again, in 

14 out of 16 countries, a majority think the world has been made 

less safe because of that war.   I’m sure that those facts are due 

to Spider Man.  There’s no question that that must have been the 

reason that people changed their thinking.  Or maybe it was in 

Men in Black, I think that probably would’ve made the case more 

effectively.   The war goes on, it continues, the polling numbers 

around the world continue to get worse and worse for the country 

we love, for the country we care about.  America is not trusted 

around the world.  And as a patriot, that’s a terrible, terrible 

thing.   And that’s not because of any fantasy TV program.  That’s 

not because of a trashy, crappy, awful movie that Hollywood’s 

made and…I’ve occasionally made some of those movies.  That’s 

not the reason and we know that and I think any rational, 

sensible, thinking person knows where that comes from.   It 

comes from reality.  Hollywood is fantasy, gentlemen.  Hollywood 

makes up stuff.  But there’s a reality out there that trumps any 

kind of bad screenwriter, or salacious material, there’s a reality 

that’s facing people all over the world, day in and day out.   And 

we have to look at that reality.  We have to embrace and deal with 

the truth of what’s in front of us.  This is a diversion.  This is, uh, 

it’s not—it’s beyond shooting the messenger.  This is trying to find 

some simple little answer, rather than looking at, truly, a terrible, 

terrible situation, which is going to take us amazing years and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 31. 

 
 
 

time and effort, to overcome.  Which is this rising and increasing 

tide of anti-Americanism.  And the United States says we’re not in 

favor of the World Court.  And it refuses to sign the global 

warming agreement.  And we hear about Abu Ghraib.  And in 

Britain, 41% of the country says the US is a greater threat than 

Iran.  This is not because of Barbra Streisand.   This is not 

because of Sean Penn.  This is not because of the Happy Feet 

movie.  I think that, we must remind ourselves over and over 

again, what Hollywood does, is fiction.  Let’s make sure that we 

understand that, let’s put fiction its proper place, yes, it can have 

some influence on people, yes, you can get annoyed at seeing 

somebody who’s not acting properly.  Yes, you can get turned off 

if there’s free sex or materialism.  But is that the reason, 

compared to this extraordinary situation, again, a war of choice, 

and a war where we’ve not been able to convince the world for any 

of the reasons—   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
One minute.   

ROBERT GREENWALD 
We’ve not been able to con—remember, we went to this war, the 

world’s opposed to us, all kinds of reasons, and we’ve not been 

able to convince the world of any of those reasons.   Whatever the 

reasons of the moment are, from the weapons of mass destruction 

or Al Qaeda’s connection to Saddam or democracy.  And we think 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 32. 

 
 
 

Hollywood is in any way causing the rise of un-Americanism?  It, 

in many ways, defies logic, and defies reason.   So…I urge all of 

you to vote your rational selves, not to vote a Hollywood fantasy 

scriptwriter who might make up a notion, that yes, some silly 

movie was going to affect people all over the world, rather than 

what’s going on today.  [APPLAUSE]    

BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Okay, I want to thank everybody on, um…on my right and left.  

And, um, I’m now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate 

vote.  Um, and I got a look at it while you all were talking and this 

is as…this is like the 2000 Florida vote, it’s very, very close.  

[LAUGHTER]   Before the debate—this is before the debate.  40% 

of you voted for, 35% against, but 25% don’t know.  So there’s a 

lot of “don’t knows,” okay?  Now…we’re now ready to begin the 

Q&A portion of the program, and, and I’ll call on the questioners.   

I have one question.  As the moderator I have the right to at least 

one question, but I have one.  And I have a question for one of the 

people on my right.  Just one of them, you can answer.  The five 

biggest films overseas abroad in the last 20 years, maybe longer, 

25 years, are… Titanic, Star Wars Episode 1, E.T., Pirates of the 

Caribbean, and Lord of the Rings.  [LAUGHTER]   None of these, 

obviously, are, I mean, are political, none of these…have a point 

of view that could be construed as anti-American.  How do you… 

how do you construe that given the argument of…of films causing 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 33. 

 
 
 

anti-Americanism?    

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
I’d be glad to respond to that.   

ROBIN BRONK 
Go ahead.    

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
Uh—  [LAUGHTER]  Uh, the proposition here is not that all films, 

uh, are anti-American.  But the fact is that one that you didn’t 

mention that may not have been among the five biggest sellers 

but that’s tremendously influential in Europe is Michael Moore.   

Michael Moore at one given moment, was the author of, uh, three 

books out of the top six on the best-seller list in Germany, 

number one, two, and six, these books that were based on, on—

or that… repeat the themes of his movies which, uh, I laughed 

when I heard Robert Greenwald say that, that, he loves his 

country.   Let me give you a sample of Michael Moore.  

“Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet, in 

thrall to conniving, thieving, smug assholes.  We Americans suffer 

from an enforced ignorance.  We don’t know about anything that’s 

happening outside our country, our stupidity is embarrassing.”   

And Michael Moore has achieved the stature of a cult figure in 

Germany, and, and immense popularity, I think Germany is 

probably the country where he’s most popular, but all around 

Europe he enjoys a, a, uh…a popularity near that dimension.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 34. 

 
 
 

[And why?  Because he is seen as the American voice for hating 

America, for everything that’s wrong and disgusting, stupid and 

idiotic in our country.  So he says, uh, you know, “I agree with 

the National Rifle Association when they say guns don’t kill 

people, people kill people.  Except I would alter that say, guns 

don’t kill people, Americans kill people.  And we are the only 

country that does this, and we do it on a personal level in our 

neighborhoods and within our families and schools and we do it 

on a global level,” close quote.   Uh, this is a man who berates us 

for ignorance who apparently has never heard of, uh, Iraq, 

Palestine, Bosnia, Somalia, Congo, Rwanda, Russia, Chechnya, et 

cetera.  So, uh, it may well be that the most popular films in 

America and abroad, that are produced by Hollywood, are films 

that are not political at all.   But, um, but there are plenty of films 

that are political, and those go in one direction, and contrary to 

Mr. Greenwald who says what Hollywood does is fiction, Michael 

Moore presents himself as doing fact, as presenting 

documentaries.   And he even has a team of lawyers and fact-

checkers and threatens, publicly, repeatedly, to sue anyone, uh, 

who dares to challenge or contradict or impugn him, so, uh, I’m 

hoping his lawyers are listening, I’m ready.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Okay, let me just, um, let’s start with, um—  [APPLAUSE]  Let’s 

start with the questions.  Um…yes, Miss.

FEMALE QUESTIONER 
Thank you, I—I have a question for those against the motion.  I 

want to put a finer point on the question itself and the way you’ve 

addressed it.  One, um—the question isn’t whether Hollywood 

was responsible for the anti-Americanism abroad, the question is 

whether it has fueled that anti-Americanism.   And we’re seeing a 

lot of movies coming out of Hollywood that use stereotypes.  It 

used to be Russians and Communists during the Cold War.  Now 

we have almost cartoon-like Arabs and Muslims in the movies.  

Do the panelists against the motion feel that that adds to anti-

Americanism abroad generally.    

RICHARD WALTER 
Well, I’ll speak to that, I think, uh, no, I don’t believe that that 

fuels anti-Americanism.  Movies like Michael Moore’s movie, and I 

think Michael Moore is an overfed, underloved narcissist, I’m not 

a fan.  Uh, but when people abroad look at a movie like that, 

what they see about America is that America’s a place where 

people can be critical of the—of their own nation.  [APPLAUSE]    

BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Um—

I sponsored a—I try to cut down on some of my activities but I 

could—as a Jew and as an American I could not turn down the 

Fulbright Commission when they asked me to, uh, sponsor an 

Egyptian scholar, I had to reach out to my Arab Muslim brother, 

particularly at this time, don’t you think.   And what he loved 

about America was its ability to, uh, be critical of the 

administration, he said if people spoke that way of Mubarek they 

would be… disappeared, or off the street.  American films, 

uh…they extol, essentially, the American dream, and what is the 

American dream, the American dream is a certain materialism to 

be sure, nothing wrong with that.   People who can’t get the basic 

material, food, clothing, shelter for themselves, for their children, 

they will listen to any tyrant, any dictator.  We’ve seen dreadful, 

dreadful history, uh, throughout history and especially the last 

100 years, testifying to the truth of that proposition.   So a certain 

materialism’s okay and people across the world, they, they just 

love what they see, they love the material stuff that they see in, in 

Hollywood films, but more to the point… Hollywood films extol the 

notion of the American dream, and what is the American dream.   

It’s the notion that if you’re willing to work hard, if you’re willing 

to get educated, in this country you can do anything.  You can 

move up from your lowly station and achieve anything if you’re 

just willing to again get educated and, and, uh, and work real

hard.   Now people will tell you on both sides that that’s a hoax, 

that’s kind of like the lottery designed to, uh, let people, uh, 

imagine they can do things that they can’t, but I must tell you 

from my perch at UCLA and in Hollywood, I see people break 

through every day, you’ll hear that it’s about connections, who 

you know.   That’s bunk, I know really well-connected people who 

cannot get arrested in Hollywood and I see absolute fresh faces 

break through every day.  Like it, don’t like it, there’re so many 

myths, so many hoaxes about Hollywood, one of the biggest 

among them, is that it is not a meritocracy, it’s all about 

connections.   The fact is that Hollywood is a remarkably 

democratic place, and truly a meritocracy, people succeed on the 

basis of their talent, on the basis of their ingenuity and their, 

their discipline, and it’s a great credit to this nation, I think it’s 

the greatest industry that we have.  [APPLAUSE]   

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
One sentence in reply, we were encouraged to break in.  Uh, 

Richard, it may be perfectly true that in some authoritarian 

countries, if they see a film, an American film that is viciously, 

uh, hostile to the American government, they say, oh, in America 

they have free speech, I wish I did too, that— that—that point is 

valid, but I was talking about Europe.  And they have just as 

much free speech in Europe and France and the UK as we have 

here.  And when those audiences, uh…eat up what Michael 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 38. 

 
 
 

Moore is offering, they’re not sitting there saying, oh, isn’t this 

wonderful, there’s free speech in the United States.    

ROBIN BRONK 
Joshua—  

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
Okay—I’m sorry, go on.    

ROBIN BRONK 
Joshua, you scare me.  I mean you’re, you are scaring me.  

[APPLAUSE]  And, and that’s fueling my anti-Americanism right 

now.  [LAUGHTER]  But—    

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
And just to add, and just to underscore what one of the 

questioners said, and that is that if you’re supporting the motion, 

the motion is not seeking the sole causative factor of America, uh, 

anti-Americanism.  It’s saying whether it’s fueled.  And also it 

doesn’t say that motion pictures are the sole cause.  We’re talking 

about generic Hollywood, which includes the export of the pop 

culture, which includes television and music, et cetera.  It’s the 

entire pop culture and what we’re depicting as an American 

image.   

ROBIN BRONK 
[OVERLAP]  So are you asking for a, uh, a completely 

whitewashed export, export?  So we should all go back to the 

days of June Cleaver and, and promote the wear – maybe we 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 39. 

 
 
 

should all be wearing pearls and vacuuming.  Is that, is that what 

you want?   

 BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  Well, I think it’s been, it’s been clearly defined that 

the motion we’re debating has nothing to do with censorship.  As 

a matter of fact – and I applaud –  

ROBIN BRONK 
[OVERLAP]  It’s not clear.  He’s asking for censorship.   

 BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  [UNCLEAR]  No, no, he’s not.   

ROBIN BRONK 
[OVERLAP]  He’s saying, Censor things that I don’t agree with.   

  BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  No, we’re asking for responsibility.    

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
 [OVERLAP]  I didn’t say anything about that.   

ROBIN BRONK 
[OVERLAP]  Of course you are.    

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
[OVERLAP]  When did I say that?  What did I--?   

ROBIN BRONK 
[OVERLAP]  You don’t, you, you don’t want to have Michael Moore 

have a voice or, or, or anyone else that you don’t seem to agree 

with.

  ROGER KIMBALL 
[OVERLAP]   Josh did not say that.    

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
[OVERLAP]  That’s not true.  I mean, that’s, that’s nonsense.  I 

didn’t say anything like that.    

BERNARD WEINRAUB  
And you know, and you know what?  I think, I think we can have 

some questions.    

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
[OVERLAP]  I, uh, uh, I don’t, I don’t want to censor him, uh, but 

I want to pour my own, uh, uh, contempt on him.  And I want to 

expose him for what he is.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  Well, you know –  

ROBIN BRONK 
[OVERLAP]  Well, make a documentary and pour your contempt 

on him.    

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  Uh, you know, I think we have some questions for –   

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
[OVERLAP]  Well, I’m not a filmmaker.  I’m, I’m a, uh, writer and 

a speaker.  So I’m here speaking.

[LAUGHTER]   

 JOSHUA MURAVCHIK  
[OVERLAP]  But Robin, you’re scaring me.    

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  Okay, let’s have some questions.  Um, sir.   

WOMAN 
Here, right here.  Right here, sir.    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Oh, I’m sorry.  Uh --   

  MALE QUESTIONER  
[OVERLAP]  Uh --   

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
He, and after, this man after him.   

 MALE QUESTIONER   
[OVERLAP]  I, I think I’m going to, uh, uh, yield the floor to the 

gentleman down there, as the two questions that I was going to 

ask have both been debated and, and talked about already.    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Okay, this, this gentleman over here.   

WOMAN 
Sir, here you go.   

  MALE QUESTIONER  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 42. 

 
 
 

Uh, most of what I’ve heard tonight, if you’ll pardon me, has not 

had a whole lot of intellectual rigor attached to it.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Okay.  [APPLAUSE]   

  AUDIENCE MEMBER  
Whoo.  [BOOS IN BACKGROUND]   

 MALE QUESTIONER  
I heard some very salient points from both sides.  I think Michael 

Moore, how can I say, as a professional documentary, uh, I’m 

going to say, maker really should go some place else because 

there are people that misconstrue what he says.  But he follows, 

he doesn’t lead.  Okay?  I think that we’ve had people abroad for a 

very long time.  It’s those people that have created impressions 

about how we behave, what we do, what we care about.  I think, 

uh, Paul Theroux made a point in, uh, one of his last books, 

Traveling in the Third World, where he said something about 

people don’t hate Americans.  People hate our government.   

WOMAN IN AUDIENCE  
Boo.   

 MALE QUESTIONER  
Okay, I think that movies basically follow, okay.  And there’s been 

something out there for a long time.  It’s not Hollywood.  It’s every 

industry we’ve got that’s out there that’s exporting a certain way.  

And those are the problems.  And it’s not, if you will, industry 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 43. 

 
 
 

generic.    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Okay.  But do you have a question for any, any of, any of us?  

  MALE QUESTIONER  
Well.  [LAUGHTER]   Sorry, sorry.  Yes.  I would say, other than, 

uh, sorry Robin, that, uh, I haven’t heard anything really 

supportive, other than sort of broad innuendo, okay, uh, about 

this and that.  I think that it’s all connecting.    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
[OVERLAP]  Okay.  Alright, okay.   

 MALE QUESTIONER  
[OVERLAP]  And I’d like to hear some really more, how do you 

say, substantive facts about how we proceed.    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
[OVERLAP]  Okay.  I, I hear you.  Um, sir, down there.  [PAUSE]   

  MALE QUESTIONER  
Thank you.  Um, I hope I’m not, uh, rendering this to be 

redundant when I say that as, um, someone who is not American 

I can confirm that, uh, Hollywood has fueled, uh, anti-

Americanism abroad.  Um, growing up in, uh, in Europe I, um, I 

sense an extreme cynicism on the part of, um, of, you know, my, 

my, uh, my peers,  um, in the sense of the smugness, um, with 

which American represents itself.  I mean, I --   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 44. 

 
 
 

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
[OVERLAP]  Uh, but do you have a question?   

  MALE QUESTIONER  
Yes, I do.  And, uh, and what I’d like to, to, to ask is that, is, uh, 

what do the members of the panel feel about, uh, the makeup of 

the panel in the sense that there are, are conservatives who were 

saying that, you know – who, who I agree with, essentially.  But 

at the same time, um, I am ex…extremely kind of like, um, 

disillusioned with American foreign policy and the war, 

particularly.  And, um, and I wonder why there’s such a 

demarcation of, um, of opinion.  Um, I, I agree with James Hirsen 

in the sense that, um, you don’t have, you know, Hollywood is not 

the, the only factor.  But at the same time, um, it, it is a factor.  

But, um –  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  Okay, yeah.   

  MALE QUESTIONER  
[OVERLAP]  I won…I won…I just wonder what people have to say 

about that.    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Well, we’ve, we’ve sort of covered that.  You know, that, how, it, 

it’s Hollywood and it’s, um, policy.  We, uh, yes sir.   

WOMAN 
Sir, here you are, sir.  Hand that over to him, please.  [PAUSE]   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 45. 

 
 
 

 MALE QUESTIONER  
 Yeah, I have a question for Mr. Greenwald.  I was, uh –  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  Okay.   

  MALE QUESTIONER  
…impressed that you in some, took advantage of your political 

activity and your personal feelings about the war.  You didn’t 

mention one part of it, and I don’t know why, and that, people 

seem to be frightened to mention – and that is our support for 

Israel.  My son just got back from Jordan, where he’s doing some 

work on Middle East policy.  And he said he was shocked how 

radicalized Jordan had become in the last month, that they, they 

have their hatred for us because of our support of our support of, 

quote, "the little Satan."  The European countries feel the same 

way.  And when they belittle and undermine American policy and 

look at our motion pictures as an example of our lives it just 

furthers their hatred for us.  And they don’t know why we’re 

supporting Israel at the expense of their nation.  Now we know 

why.    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
All right, but what is that, you say, let me just, uh, uh –  

  MALE QUESTIONER 
[OVERLAP]  Yeah.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 46. 

 
 
 

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Just, uh, what does that have to do with Hollywood?   

 MALE QUESTIONER  
Because he was making statements as a political activist that he 

brought this, uh, business about the war in when they were 

talking about motion pictures.   

 BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Right, okay.   

  MALE QUESTIONER  
[OVERLAP]  So my question is, I think there’s a big part of it 

that’s being overlooked here – is that our support of Israel, which 

I fully support, is a large part of the hatred of America today.   

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
All right, but let’s, okay, let’s, let’s just stick – Uh, I appreciate 

that, sir.   

  MALE QUESTIONER  
[OVERLAP]  Okay.    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
[OVERLAP]  But let’s just stick to the issue of Hollywood and 

Hollywood’s impact on, you know, foreign, uh, on abroad and 

what impact it has, either positive or negative, and, you know, 

um, let’s stick to has Hollywood, Hollywood has fueled anti-

Americanism abroad.  Has it or has it not?  Yes sir.   

  MALE QUESTIONER  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 47. 

 
 
 

Well, to your point – and to go back to the point this lady made, 

uh, which was the, I thought the most intelligent comment that 

anybody’s made so far – which is that the, uh, [SMALL 

APPLAUSE]  the side against has, um, distorted this entire, uh, 

debate by, by moving off the "Hollywood has fueled anti-

Americanism abroad" issue to the war.  We are not discussing the 

impact of the war.  The war has its own impact.  We all know 

that.  But for you to, to de…deflect that, uh, into this, this, this 

main issue, I think is not really meeting the point of the debate.  

And therefore by definition you lose.  [LAUGHTER]    

RICHARD WALTER 
Well, I, I, I quite disagree.   

  MALE QUESTIONER  
[OVERLAP]  You’re not arguing the, you’re not arguing the point.   

RICHARD WALTER 
[OVERLAP]  Uh, I don’t think it’s fair at all what you say, 

respectfully.  Uh, we’re, we know there is a rise around the world, 

uh, in anti-American sentiment.  Um, we’re arguing that’s it not, 

not, uh, Hollywood fueling that.  Aren’t we allowed to say what we 

think, uh, just might have something to do with that?  Can 

anybody doubt, [SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE]  if you read the 

papers, what it is that, uh, that, that fuels this – these 

wrongheaded and disastrous policies that represent the opposite 

of the American ideal and the American tradition?

PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 48. 

 
 
 

 JOSHUA MURAVCHIK  
Yeah, but there was a lot of anti –  

  ROBERT GREENWALD 
[OVERLAP]  If, if it was, if it was a le – If it was a court case and 

Hollywood was being tried as, you know, the guilty one for the 

crime we’re saying, No, we know who the guilty one for the crime 

is.  We know what that guilty is and it’s the war. There’s no, no 

question about it.  I understand your point and we could parse 

the words.  What does fuel mean?  How much fuel?  But I 

actually think it’s much more substantive to go to the real, the 

real question -- or the real question behind the question, from my 

point of view, maybe not yours – and say, Here is why anti-

Americanism is being fueled a…abroad.  We know the reason.   

  MAN  
[OVERLAP]  Yes, but that --  

  ROGER KIMBALL  
[OVERLAP]  Yes, but that would assume that, that anti-

Americanism is a new phenomenon.  It’s not.  We’ve had it –  No.   

 ROBERT GREENWALD 
[OVERLAP]  No, not new.  But the numbers are – Uh, there’s no – 

Do you doubt that the numbers are increasing?   

  ROGER KIMBALL  
[OVERLAP]  Yes, I do.  I do.

PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 49. 

 
 
 

[OVERLAP]  Since – Wait a minute.  You don’t think since the 

Iraqi War that it’s not increased?   

  ROGER KIMBALL 
[OVERLAP]  Well, I, I, I can –  

  JAMES HIRSEN  
[OVERLAP]  [UNCLEAR]  [UNCLEAR]…that it’s not increasing 

numbers because you questioned whether we could debate the 

statistics.   

 ROBERT GREENWALD 
Yes, and I’ve got the…[UNCLEAR]   

  JAMES HIRSEN  
[OVERLAP]  The Pew poll, um, yeah, okay.  Good.  [LAUGHTER]  

The Pew poll sampled –  

  ROBERT GREENWALD 
[OVERLAP]  I got, you got your copy, I got mine.   

  JAMES HIRSEN  
…sampled, uh, nine hundred and two people in Great Britain.  

Four hundred and twelve of them were Muslim.  Nine hundred 

and five in France, four hundred were Muslim.   

 ROBERT GREENWALD 
That’s… 

 JAMES HIRSEN  
Nine hundred and two in Germany, four hundred and thirteen 

are Muslim.  That does not reflect the percentages of the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 50. 

 
 
 

populations in those countries.  That poll, that poll is statistically 

invalid.  [APPLAUSE]    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
Um, well, let me get this.  Yes sir.  I’m sorry.   

  JAMES HIRSEN  
[OVERLAP]  Well, wait, wait, wait.  I, I want to get in on this, 

please.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  Okay.    

JOSHUA MURAVCHIK 
Because, uh, the, the two, the two people in the audience, uh, 

nailed this point more, uh, most clearly.  It is, it is not a court 

case.  This is not a crime in which there’s one victim and one 

perpetrator.  We’re talking about attitudes in the world that 

involve, uh, hundreds of, of millions or billions of people.  And 

there are many causative factors.  And I don’t know what it is 

about the word fueling that you don’t understand.  But the 

question here is whether Hollywood is one of those factors.  And 

the very simple, uh, uh, you, answer to your effort to put this all 

on Iraq is that there was a lot of anti-Americanism in the world, 

uh, before the war in Iraq.  There was a lot of anti-Americanism 

in the world before Bush was elected President.  There was a 

Gallop poll, uh, of the Muslim world, taken, uh, a year before the 

war in Iraq, that – but after the war in Afghanistan, in which 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 51. 

 
 
 

larger numbers of the respondents, uh, said they thought that, 

uh, that 9/11, the attack, the terrorist act of 9/11, was justified, 

than thought that our attack on the Al Qaeda and Taliban in 

Afghanistan, uh, was justified.  And you can go back, uh, uh, to 

the Nineties when we were discussing enlarging NATO and there 

was a huge, uh, uh, outpouring of, uh, of, uh, anti-Americanism 

in Europe, afraid that the perpetuation of, of, uh, of NATO would 

be, as the French Foreign Minister put it, a Trojan horse to, to 

keep the Americans in control, uh, of NATO.  This anti-

Americanism comes from many reasons.  It comes from some 

policies that we may think are wrong or, or Iraq or what have you.  

It comes from other policies that fewer people, uh, in this room 

would disagree with, as this gentleman pointed out, uh, from our 

support for Israel.  Uh, I spend, uh, a lot of time in the Middle 

East.  And when you talk to Middle Easterners they have two 

grievances against America at this moment and the war in Iraq is 

number two.  It’s our support for Israel that’s, uh, that’s number 

one.  And, uh, the, the issue of, uh, the fact is that we’re not 

going to be able to conduct ourselves in the world according to 

any policies without making some people angry, some people 

dislike us and so on.  The question that we’re talking about 

tonight is whether the fare that Michael Moore and Oliver Stone 

and, uh, the, the other, uh, uh, Hollywood opinion shapers are 

putting out to the world, uh, contributes to and compounds that.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 52. 

 
 
 

ROBERT GREENWALD  
The, the, yeah.  Well, let me respond.  First of all, you did see the 

sentence here.  I know you did not intentionally leave it out – 

which is clearly marked, “Sample is weighed to be representative 

of the general population. “ So you’re not just quoting the first – 

Let me finish.    

JOSHUA MURAVCHIK 
[OVERLAP]  No, I understand that it says that.  But look at the 

percentages.   

 ROBERT GREENWALD  
[OVERLAP]  So you’re not just quoting – So I understand --   

JOSHUA MURAVCHIK 
But look at the percentages.   

 ROBERT GREENWALD  
Okay, but it says that.  You got the percentages from here and it 

says, We know the percentages are too large and like good 

statisticians did, we adjusted for it.  But let me go back to the 

substantive point, cause you’re just wrong on that one.  

[LAUGHTER]   The substantive point is, I think, goes back to 

what Bernie said.  Yes, Michael Moore has three best selling 

books in Germany.  But it doesn’t compare to The Titanic, Star 

Wars, E.T., Pirates…and Lord of the Rings.  It’s not even close.  

And how do we make the case that those movies that are loved 

around the world, they’re embraced around the world, that people 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 53. 

 
 
 

fight to get in and see around the world – how do we say that is 

fueling anti-Americanism?   

ROBIN BRONK 
And, and your –  

 ROGER KIMBALL  
[OVERLAP]  We don’t.  Nobody says that.   

ROBIN BRONK 
[OVERLAP]  And, and your question is – and what we’re saying is 

–  

 ROBERT GREENWALD  
[OVERLAP]  So you’re agreeing with us.  Thank you.   

ROBIN BRONK 
No, Hollywood is not a factor, is not a significant factor.  Yes, 

there are many reasons.  I mean, it could be the proliferation of 

trans fats across the world.  There are many reasons.  But 

Hollywood is not the most significant reason why anti-

Americanism is growing around the world.    

 BERNARD WEINRAUB  
All right, let’s get some questions.  Um, uh, uh, yes sir.   

  ROBERT SIEGEL   
Hi.  Uh, I have a question for James Hirsen and, uh, Dana Wolfe 

said I should identify myself as Robert Siegel of NPR.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
[OVERLAP]  Okay.    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 54. 

 
 
 

  ROBERT SIEGEL   
I’ll be actually hosting the radio, uh, broadcast of the debate.  

[APPLAUSE]  And my, my question is, in the schema between the, 

the heroic golden age of Hollywood and the modern cynical age 

that you’ve drawn, uh, where would the movies of Frank Capra 

fit?  That is, in It’s a Wonderful Life, uh, there’s the fact that a 

banker and real estate developer is clearly villainous and evil, 

even though we know in real life in the decades since that time – 

he’s, he’s been the more efficient actor in the economy who has 

prevailed over the sentimental profligate S&L, which is heroic.  

Was that, was that a movie that fanned anti-Americanism at the 

time by, uh, presenting business in a negative light, or for that 

matter, was Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, which made a great 

deal out of big time corruption --  a movie that fanned anti-

Americanism?  Or are we more sensitive today than we were then 

to the images of us on the screen?    

 JAMES HIRSEN  
Okay, good question.  I think it’s the degree of specialization that 

Hollywood has had in villainizing and demonizing the 

representatives of free enterprise.  And why, and why do I even 

talk about free enterprise?   Because America in the world 

represents the greatest experiment in free enterprise in the 

history of man.  I mean, Western civilization generally – and 

America specifically – is an aberration in human history.  And 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 55. 

 
 
 

part of the whole class warfare concept, really, is to make success 

something that you should feel guilty for.  And you see this theme 

running through.  And it, and it’s, and it becomes more prevalent 

when Oliver Stone names a character after a lizard.  It becomes 

more prevalent when we have this series of movies where the plot 

line involves the evil corporation and the crusading worker or 

journalist, or single mother with a push-up bra.  It, it, it’s the 

same pattern but what it does is, it takes away from a great part 

of this country.  Instead of something that could be told which is 

sort of the entrepreneurial cowboys in this country, going back to 

the luminaries like Thomas Edison to national treasures like 

Steve Jobs.  Who creates prosperity around the world through 

innovation that is fostered by a system that didn’t happen by 

accident.  I think that that, that is a significant and more subtle 

point of anti-Americanism though I, I say it’s not exclusive to the 

period after the decline of the studio system in the sixties.  But 

then again, Frank Capra also made films, a series of films called 

Why We Fight that were made specifically during a time of war to 

bolster our side and demoralize their side.  Instead today, as we 

brought up with Syriana and other films of that elk, films are 

being made to bolster their side – [OVERLAPPING VOICES] and to 

demoralize our side. 

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
We have time for one more question, okay?  Uh, that gentleman 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 56. 

 
 
 

over there.  [INAUDIBLE]  I'm sorry.  God um, lets make it, sorry, 

lets make it a woman.  Okay, the lady over there.  Five what? 

FEMALE QUESTIONER 
Five men and one woman and every movie you’ve mentioned has 

been produced and directed by men.  We are fifty percent of the 

population and I would appreciate us being represented.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Okay, is there another question?  [LAUGHTER]  

JOSHUA MURAVCHIK 
I want to answer that.  If every movie I’ve mentioned was 

produced by a man, it just shows that women are not guilty for 

uh, for fueling anti-Americanism.  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Miss.  

FEMALE QUESTIONER 
I was just going to ask the same question that he did, only about 

the best years of our lives, the great movies from the thirties or 

forties, was it? 

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Right.  

FEMALE QUESTIONER 
I mean, what has been the change?  What’s changed since then 

that’s made our attitudes so completely different?   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 57. 

 
 
 

ROGER KIMBALL 
And the, the short word is the 1960s.  I mean why is it that today 

you can never hear the word corporation?  This is now, it’s, it’s 

synonymous with evil.  And if you prefix the word corporation 

with multinational, it becomes kind of the, the epitome of all evil.  

Why is that?  I mean sure there were plenty of movies in the past 

that may have represented this or that businessman, this or that 

politician as corrupt or evil, but now it’s always the case.  I mean 

some of my colleagues mentioned movies that, where they’ve 

changed the plot.  I mean, and I’ll just mention one more, The 

Bourne Identity.  In the book, the bad guy was Carlos the Jackal.  

In the movie, it’s the CIA and this is consistent.  I mean it’s just 

every kind of thriller that you see these days uh, the United 

States government, the United States military, the United States 

commercial enterprise.  It’s always presented as somehow 

corrupt, venal, savage.   
BERNARD WEINRAUB 

Alright we have one more question from this gentleman – 

[OVERLAPPING VOICES].   

MALE QUESTIONERS 
Obviously artists always have an obligation to their countries, but 

are you really going to sit here and compare Frank Capra’s 

obligation to an America that had been attacked at Pearl Harbor 

and was threatened by a Nazi menace with the obligation of an 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 58. 

 
 
 

artist today who’s facing a war that was effectively picked and is 

uh, demonstrably going nowhere during the same time frame that 

it took to win all of World War II?   

MALE QUESTIONER 
Well actually I, I think that um we now face um, a, a faux that is 

maybe the most dangerous we have faced since the Battle of 

Leponto.  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]  I guess he wants you to 

answer that.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
It’s time folks.  And now um, ladies and gentlemen, it’s now time 

to vote.  And – [OVERLAPPING VOICES].  We vote and as they 

vote, you do closing.  Is that correct?   

MAN 
Yeah, don’t vote yet.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
As you vote, as they vote, you have your closing, okay?  That’s the 

rule.  So um, it’s time to vote.  So um, if you want to vote for the 

motion, tear off “For” from the top, from the top, and put it in the 

ballot boxes that are going around.  If you're against, tear off 

“Against” and put it in the ballot box.  If you're, um, undecided, 

put in the whole thing.  If you need a voting ticket, the ushers will 

give it to you.  Uh, and while we’re doing this, uh, we’re having 

final remarks from the panelists.  Beginning with a side opposing 

the motion, the first person who’s going to speak will be Robert 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

Walter.   

RICHARD WALTER 
Richard Walter.  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
I'm sorry, Richard Walter.  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]  I'm sorry, 

Richard Walter. 

RICHARD WALTER 
Now Hollywood takes on corporations because it’s David and 

Goliath.  I have nothing against the corporations, I'm a free 

enterprise capitalist myself.  And um, the reason they uh, these, 

these stories treat them the way they do is because it’s the little 

guy versus the, versus the big guy.  Nothing new about it at all.  

You know American film is world film.  Films made outside the 

United States, only one in ten will be shown outside the country 

of its origin, but all American films are shown outside the country 

of their origin.  Some as you know are, are shown only outside 

the country of their origin.  That is to say, they can’t win domestic 

distribution deals and instead are released on cable and direct to 

video.  What can explain this?  The answer is the quality of 

American film and I also I believe the diversity of American films, 

the immigrant heritage of the American uh, nation and of the 

American film business in particular.  When you look at American 

films, you’re looking at the world because you're seeing people of 

every race, of every creed, of every persuasion.  American films 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

are the single biggest export in the nation.  They contribute more 

affirmatively to the reduction of the unfavorable balance of trade.  

They are a blessing upon us and should be celebrated by people 

who really love this country, who really consider them to be 

patriotic, rather than constantly besmirching them and caviling 

about them.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Thank you.  Okay, for, Roger Kimball. 

ROGER KIMBALL 
Well I remember when I was in uh, high school.  My Jesuit 

teachers would drum various things into us.  And one saying they 

had was “Never deny, seldom affirm, always distinguish.”  It pains 

me to observe that the speakers against this motion tonight seem 

to be unable to appreciate that the motion does not say that 

Hollywood causes anti-Americanism.  It is not a referendum on 

the Bush administration or the war in Iraq.  It simply says that 

Hollywood fuels anti-Americanism abroad.  It seems to me that 

um, my team has supplied numerous examples of how this, how 

this happens.  And we could certainly spend the entire night 

providing examples.  One of the people on the opposing side 

remarked on the remarkable outpouring sympathy for the United 

States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.  Well I, I would, and 

then its quick evaporation.  Um I would say that that outpouring 

of sympathy was basically a version of sentimentality lodged upon 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 61. 

 
 
 

the United States in its you know, unusual posture as victim.  As 

soon as the United States began standing up for itself, that 

sympathy vanished.  And I think that tells us a lot about the 

world opinion and how we can depend upon it.  But in terms of 

Hollywood which is really a mindset, as James Hirsen said, it’s 

not just the movies.  It’s really, we’re talking about a way of 

looking at the world, pop culture in general.  I think this is a 

mindset that has given up on America in many ways, given up on 

those traditional virtues.  James mentioned free enterprise but 

there are many other things.  Individual liberty, belief in the, in 

the future, really.  And –  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Roger.   

ROGER KIMBALL 
Done?  I will finish then, or stop.  [APPLAUSE] 

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Okay uh, against, Robin.  

ROBIN BRONK 
Um I guess the only thing I can say is that if American movies uh, 

bred anti-American sentiment, I'm not sure why Iran and North 

Korea don’t have compulsory Sunday matinees.  [CHUCKLES], 

[APPLAUSE]. 

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Uh, okay, for.  Joshua Muravchick. 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 62. 

 
 
 

JOSHUA MURAVCHICK 
Uh, in her earlier remarks, Robin said that there’s no scientific 

proof, no reliable study that Hollywood is responsible for 

encouraging anti-American sentiment.  That is absolutely true.  

There’s also no reliable study, no proof that any other factor 

whatsoever causes anti-Americanism.  We have this phenomenon 

of anti-Americanism.  There are many things that contribute to it.  

And uh, we, we don’t have any science of anti-Americanism to tell 

us exactly which.  I think common sense tells us that some, the 

kind of work of someone like Michael Moore which is so 

tremendously popular in Europe contributes to that.  And when 

we have Robert talk about that house in moment after 9/11 when 

the world all loved us, uh, that moment was symbolized by a 

headline in Le Monde.  Which translated, said “We are all 

Americans now.”  And that was repeated here many times.  

However if you get Le Monde and read the essay, the essay was 

brimming with anti-Americanism, saying you know this attack is 

a terrible thing but it’s what the Americans deserved for the way 

they attempt to dominate the world.  Uh, and as for the likes of, 

of uh, Oliver Stone, I’d just like to share with you an anecdote.  

Last year, I had the opportunity to attend a conference in 

Ramallah.  I was one of only two Americans there.  There were 

hundreds of Palestinians talking among themselves.  And one, 

Hani al-Hassan, who had been a member of Arafat’s cabinet, gave 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 63. 

 
 
 

the sort of keynote address, a history of the Arab-Israel conflict.  

And he said, in the early 1960s, President Yasser wanted to end 

the conflict with Israel so he sent a letter to President Kennedy 

telling him how that could be done.  President Kennedy sent him 

back a letter saying, yes I agree, and this was all about to be 

consummated when the Zionists assassinated Kennedy.  And uh, 

I sat there stunned in my seat, but how would I explain to young 

Palestinians who have seen the, the likes of Oliver Stone’s uh, 

paranoid fantasies about what happened to Kennedy, uh, that 

uh, Hani al-Hassan’s uh, it’s just implausible.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Joshua.  Thanks very much.  [APPLAUSE]  Against, Robert 

Greenwald.  

ROBERT GREENWALD 
Well it’s slightly off subject, but I want to know why Josh was one 

of only two Americans at this conference.  Now I am scared for 

our country and the impression they get, and have somebody over 

there who advocated for the war and wants us to bomb Iran.  But 

going back to the primary subject, lets not confuse bad movies or 

even critical movies.  The assumption here is, if it’s a movie 

critical of something in the United States, therefore that will fuel 

anti-Americans.  Not true, not accurate.  To use Jo-, to use Josh’s 

words, common sense can tell us that many people all over the 

world and many people here have seen movies that are critical.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 64. 

 
 
 

That does not turn you into anti-American.  And I would argue 

that the movies, the popular movies, the ones that are being seen 

in overwhelming numbers, as Bernie helpfully provided this list, 

far outweigh – and if we go back to the, the woman’s question 

about fueling, you know I don't want to get into technical what is 

fuel and what’s not fuel.  But lets say for a moment, Titanic, Star 

Wars, E.T., that’s building tremendous goodwill which would 

[UNCLEAR] and therefore there would be no fuel for the couple of 

incidents which might possibly, on a given day, encourage 

somebody to be against us.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
And for, James Hirsen.  [PHONE RINGING]  Please. 

JAMES HIRSEN 
Um -  

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
James Hirsen. 

JAMES HIRSEN 
Yeah I mentioned uh, you know I, I live close to Los Angeles and I 

love Hollywood, but I love America more.  And uh, I’ll tell you, 

Richard Dreyfuss, who used to speak differently about America 

until he went on a campaign to teach civics and he read some 

himself, has called this country a miracle.  And the innovations 

and advancements that we’ve had here were because of a system 

where for the very first time, rights and powers were viewed as 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 65. 

 
 
 

implanted in individuals.  And some of those were transferred, 

pursuant to a social contract we call the Constitution, to a 

government.  That had never happened before.  Um this motion 

is, is about free speech.  And uh, to address an audience member 

who asked about responsibility today, the responsibility is greater 

for two reasons.  One is because of what Thomas Freedman calls 

the flat earth.  Because Hollywood exports more instantly, and 

two is because of the greater war.  We were attacked in the city, it 

was the greatest attack on continental soil in our history.  The 

greater war continues, even many of those who opposed the war 

in Iraq are still cognizant of the fact that there is a war on terror.  

The reason I, I had asked you to vote for the motion was simply to 

raise awareness that this output of pop culture coming out of 

Hollywood matters.  And it’s not only for our domestic 

consumption, it’s being consumed by the world, it shapes the way 

they view us.  And Hollywood ought to use its power to help 

America prosper.  I mean in that way, in the world’s eyes, they’d 

be a winner.  [APPLAUSE]   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Well I, I want to thank the debaters and the audience for their 

good work.  And before I announce the results of the audience 

voting, I want to take care of a few things.  I would like to invite 

you all to return next year for the Fifth Intelligence Squared US 

Debate on Wednesday, February 7 here at the Asia Society.  The 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM                   Rosenkranz Foundation- Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroadPage 66. 

 
 
 

motion to be debated is “America is too damn religious.”  The 

debate will be moderated by the co-director of the Fordham 

Center on Religion and Culture and The New York Times 

columnist, Peter Steinfels.  An edited version of tonight’s 

Intelligence Squared US Debate can be heard locally on WNYC 

AM, AM820 on Friday, December 22nd at 2PM.  Copies of James 

Hirsen’s Hollywood Nation: Left Coast Lies, Old Media Spin, and 

New Media Revolution, Roger Kimball’s books, The Long March and 

The Rape of the Masters, and Richard Walter’s Screenwriting: The

pick up a copy of tomorrow’s edition of The Times of London, 

along with a special subscription offer for IQ2 US patrons.  And 

now the results of the debate.  After the debaters did their best to 

sway you and the question was, Hollywood has fueled anti-

Americanism abroad, you voted thirty-five percent for the motion, 

fifty-nine percent against the motion – [APPLAUSE].  And six 

percent don’t, did not know.  Which means that those against the 

motion carried the day.   

MAN 
Turned it around too.   

BERNARD WEINRAUB 
Congratulations.  And congratulations to everybody and thanks 

very much, thank you.  [APPLAUSE]
