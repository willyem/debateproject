JOHN DONVAN 

Well— welcome everyone to another debate from Intelligence 

Squared US, I’m John Donvan of ABC News, and once again it 

is my honor and pleasure to be serving as moderator as the six 

debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the Skirball 

Center for the Performing Arts at New York University,  six 

debaters, three against three, will be debating this motion, 

“America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.”  Now, normally 

at this point in the evening the chairman of Intelligence 

Squared, Robert Rosenkranz, who is also chairman of the 

Rosenkranz Foundation, takes to the stage, and he briefly 

outlines what’s before us, what our debate really is about and 

what the issues are.   Unfortunately he has taken ill this 

evening so we will not be hearing from him and we wish him

well.  I’ll just say very briefly, in terms of the drug war—that 

language has been around a long time, it’s 40 years this year 

that Richard Nixon first declared a war on drugs in the United 

States.   Mexico launched its war on drugs three years ago, the 

difference is, that in Mexico it really is a war, as we think of 

war.  It involves troops, and grenades and bombs and bullets, 

and it has come at a huge cost of 10,000 lives lost.  The 

question before us is whether the United States has some 

responsibility to bear for this, given the fact that the United 

States serves as such a large market for narcotics, the 

question is also raised, whether there would be a war at all, 

whether the cartels could arm themselves but for the supply of 

illicit weapons from the United States.  Are we in essence, 

responsibility for those 10,000 deaths.  That is the question 

before us but we’re putting it in this form, “America is to 

Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.”   I want to remind everyone this 

is not a panel discussion or a seminar, this is a debate, it’s a 

contest, there will be winners and losers.  And you in our 

audience will be the judges, you will pick the winners, you will 

have voted twice by the time the debate begins, once before, 

and once again after the debate.   And the team that moves the 

most voters, that changes the most minds, will be declared our 

winner.  Now let’s go to the preliminary vote, before the debate 

begins.  And turn to the keypad at your left side…  There’s a 

range of numbers, but you only need to concern yourselves

with numbers 1, 2, or 3.   If you agree with the motion, 

“America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War,” push number 1, 

if you disagree, push number 2, and if you are 

undecided…push number 3.  If you make a mistake, just 

correct it, and the system will lock in your last response.  All 

right, I will have those results fairly shortly, but we’re going to 

move on now, so—   On to our debate and on to Round 1, 

opening statements from each of the debaters, seven minutes 

each, uninterrupted.  And, speaking first, for the motion, 

Fareed Zakaria, who— and if there are people out there still 

who doubt that an intellectual can also be popular in the 

United States, Fareed Zakaria is that example, he is the host—

Fareed, you can make your way to the microphone—he is the 

host of “Fareed Zakaria, GPS” on CNN and Fareed, I’m certain 

that has nothing to do with getting directions off the highway.  

What does the “GPS” stand for?   

FAREED ZAKARIA  

“Global Public Square.”   

JOHN DONVAN 

“Global Public Square,” how appropriate for this, ladies and 

gentlemen, Fareed Zakaria.   

[APPLAUSE]   

FAREED ZAKARIA 

Thank you very much, it’s such a pleasure to be here.  You 

know, I feel very comfortable, I have to say, at the outset with 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

the opposing team, sharing a podium with people with very 

different views about drugs, immigration, Mexico, because, my 

show at CNN is actually taped in the same studios as Lou 

Dobbs’s.   So I shared—  [LAUGHTER]  I shared studio space 

with Lou Dobbs, I can share a platform with you gentlemen, 

I’m delighted to do so.  Look, what I thought I would do is try 

to convince you as best I can, that you should vote for this 

proposition.   And, we are on the 40th anniversary of the drug 

war.  The war on drugs was declared by Richard Nixon, and it 

began a vast effort by the United States government, to 

transform the issue of drugs into one about criminality and 

war.   And it began a massive program in the United States 

that has spread throughout the region.  The results are in, 40 

years out, I would argue.  We have spent about $1 trillion.  

That does not count by the way what local and state 

governments spend every year, to enforce the war on drugs, 

which is $41 billion.  Every year.  Now, if you look at any 

metric, I would argue, that would be reasonable to apply the 

availability of drug use, the potency of drugs, for the most part 

the price—the metrics suggest the drug war has failed, it has 

done nothing to dampen demand, it has perhaps in many ways 

increased potency, and certainly increased criminality.   So, if 

you look at the simplest statistic in terms of what the effect of 

this vast war on drugs has had over the last 40 years.  In the 

1970s, the United States had the same incarceration rate, as 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 5. 

 

 

 

every other country in the world.  We were about at the world 

average in terms of how many people we imprisoned, as a 

percentage of our population.   That rate today, is five times 

the world average.  In 1980, those blissful, halcyon days of 

1980, we had 41,000 people in prison on drug-related charges.  

Today we have 500,000 people.  So, if you ask yourself, what 

the effect in the United States has been it seems to me plain, it 

is blindingly obvious.   The question, I suppose, we have to 

then ask ourselves is what is the effect outside the United 

States, because there has been another effect of this war on 

drugs, which has been to internationalize the problem.   

Because we began this process, by interdicting in Miami, and 

then started moving to the sources, because the sources also 

started fleeing offshore.  Then we went into Central America.  

You all remember that before we had the heroic wars of 

liberation in Afghanistan and Iraq we had the heroic war of 

liberation in Panama, where Manuel Noriega was indicted in a 

US court for drug dealing and we decided to send the US Army 

there, play very loud rock music, I am not kidding, and 

effectively arrested him.  What has happened in almost all 

those cases is, the supply then shifts.   And so it then shifted 

to Colombia, and we began Plan Colombia, which has been a 

vast, multi-year effort with many, many hundreds of American 

soldiers.  When we talk about Mexico’s drug war which I will 

get to, one has to remember, that the wars on drugs that the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 6. 

 

 

 

United States has initiated over the last 40 years, have very 

much been ones involving troops and soldiers and bullets and 

deaths.   Mexico is only the last in a long line of these drug 

wars.  And so we got to Colombia, where the United States has 

now spent something in the range of eight to $10 billion.  

Colombia for many years was the second or third largest 

recipient of US aid, and much of that aid has gone toward 

intensely military activities.   The GAO, the Government 

Accounting Office was asked to provide a summary report on 

what the effect of Plan Colombia has been.  And this was only 

a few months ago, asked for by Vice President Biden, then-

Senator Biden, had commissioned the report.  And the results 

are plain.  It has had virtually no effect.  It seems as though 

heroin production is down, but cocaine production is up.  And 

so you see the familiar Whack-a-Mole problem of the drug 

trade, which is that you push something down and something 

else pops up.   And the two most common substitutions you 

see are the kind of drug, so you go from heroin to cocaine, and 

the place that these come from.  You push it out of the 

Caribbean, you—it goes into Panama, you push it out of 

Panama it goes into Colombia, you push it out of Colombia, it 

goes to Mexico.   And thus Mexico has to be seen as the last of 

a long line of these battles, in America’s war on drugs.  And so 

in that sense you have to ask yourself, are we not in some way 

responsible for it?  Well here’s the simple reality.  We are the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 7. 

 

 

 

largest consumer of drugs in the world.   We have the most 

demand in the world.  And we also have the largest supply of 

weaponry in the world.  2,000 guns cross the American border 

every day to go into Mexico.  Hillary Clinton has pointed out 

that we are arming the Mexican gangsters who operate the 

drug trade.   President Obama has pointed out that 90 percent 

of the weapons that are found in Mexico can be traced back to 

the United States.  There has been some contestation over the 

statistics… Fox News says it’s only 17 percent, Factcheck.org 

says it’s probably higher than 36 percent, but maybe not quite 

as high as 90 percent.  Let me give you a simple statistic.  The 

United States has 280 million guns.  50 percent of all gun 

production every year is bought in the United States.  There 

are 80 million registered gun users in the United States.  There 

are 2,500 in Mexico.  I think we may have something to do 

with this problem.   So if you accept my proposition that the 

supply of weapons is coming from one place and the demand 

for drugs is coming from one place, it seems self-evident that 

we are responsible.  You will hear many convincing arguments 

by honorable people on that side.   Honorable opponents of the 

Mexican government like Mr. Castañeda who ran against 

President Calderón.  Asa Hutchinson who ran the Drug 

Enforcement Agency.  But remember one thing.  The only 

question we are asking you is are we in some way responsible.   

Let us not one more time shirk our responsibility, and accept

that the United States, as the leading consumer of drugs, and 

the leading supplier of weapons, has got to be partly or 

substantially to blame for this.  Mexico is the latest battle—

Our motion is “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War,” 

and speaking first against the motion, Asa Hutchinson who 

was a Congressman from Arkansas, an elected position, but 

he’s also held significant appointed positions, he was a US 

Attorney, he was in the Department of Homeland Security for 

controlling border security, and was also Director of the Drug 

Enforcement Agency which, Asa, makes it sound like, in terms 

of this narcotics issue, for a long time, you were the law.   

ASA HUTCHINSON 

Indeed, and we enforced the law.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Ladies and gentlemen, Asa Hutchinson.

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 9. 

 

 

 

[APPLAUSE]   

ASA HUTCHINSON 

Thank you, and seriously, I did have occasion to head up the 

Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, and there’s one 

thing I learned, Fareed, very quickly as head of the DEA, that 

when you made a speech somewhere you had a way of drawing 

protesters.   And particularly if you debated drug policy in San 

Francisco, so I am delighted that this audience is a little bit 

more friendly.  And the other thing I learned that as a dad of a 

teenaged daughter, that being head of the DEA was a good way 

to drive away boyfriends that you didn’t want calling on your 

daughter.  [LAUGHTER]   So, there are a few advantages to 

that.  I am here today, on this debate topic because I believe it 

is critically important to the national security of the United 

States.  I believe what happens in Mexico is critically 

important to that country, but I also believe that what happens 

in the overall fight against illegal drugs is important for this 

generation and the next of Americans.   And I would agree with 

Fareed that we do have responsibilities, as United States 

citizens to reduce the demand for drugs in our country.  There 

is a responsibility but ladies and gentlemen, I’ve noticed 

something thus far today, and they’re trying to change the 

proposition.   The proposition is not that the United States 

shares some responsibility.  The proposition is that America is 

to blame.  And I believe there’s a distinction between blame 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 10. 

 

 

 

and responsibility, or joint responsibility, or some 

responsibility.   And “blame” is a heavy word, that implies that 

we as a government of the United States are doing something 

wrong.  I agree that we have responsibility but it’s a shared 

responsibility.  Drug consumption is not unique to the United 

States.  I met with Vincente Fox in Mexico City.  And I was 

there as Under-Secretary at Homeland Security but he didn’t 

want to talk about that subject with Secretary Ridge,  he 

turned to me and said Asa, you were head of the DEA, we’ve 

got a problem in Mexico with drug consumption and addiction 

that we need to do something about.  He was talking about 

Mexicans, and he’s talking about the challenges of drugs in his 

society.  And that is across the globe that there is that 

problem.   And…to respond to Fareed about where we are in 

our fight against drugs today, we should be reminded of some 

of our successes.  Ladies and gentlemen, since the late ‘70s 

and early ‘80s, when we initiated strong effort against the fight 

against drugs, we have reduced overall drug consumption in 

the United States by 50 percent.  Please remember that 

statistic, you can go on monitoring the future websites, a 

consistent poll and survey that’s done, as well as SAMHSA’s 

survey…overall drug use has declined 50 percent in our 

country, cocaine use has declined 75 percent, since the height 

of the drug problems in the ‘70s, and in the ‘80s.   Ladies and 

gentlemen, that is progress that represents saved lives.  Now

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 11. 

 

 

 

let me move quickly to why the Mexican drug war, the United 

States is not to blame for Mexico’s drug war.  And the first 

answer is that Mexico has allowed itself to be a major transit 

and source country.   They are a transit country obviously for 

drugs but the source drugs that come from Mexico, heroin, 

marijuana that they grow in the hills, as well as 

methamphetamine that they produce, they’re sources of that, 

and they as a sovereign country have allowed themselves to be 

in that predicament.  Secondly, Mexico has resisted US help.  

This is important to put this in the context of history.  In the 

1980s, as Fareed pointed out, two thirds of our illegal drugs in 

the United States came through the Caribbean basin into 

Miami.  We had Miami Vice, we slowed it down in the 

Caribbean basin, but they moved toward other avenues to 

bring it in, and that being Mexico and today 90 percent of the 

cocaine comes through Mexico.   How did this happen.  It’s 

because Mexico did not shoulder the burden to say we want to 

resist in our country, it is a long historic problem that goes 

back to the ‘80s, decades, it’s not something that’s just 

happened in the last three years.   A key event happened.  In 

February of 1985, Kiki Camarena, a wonderful DEA agent, was 

captured in Guadalajara, brutally beaten, tortured, and 

murdered.  It was a seminal event in our relations.  As a result 

of that there was a massive manhunt for the perpetrators of 

that.   Mexico believed that we were infringing upon their 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 12. 

 

 

 

sovereignty.  And therefore, they resisted any US assistance 

after that event in 1985, in fact in 1986 the Foreign Minister of 

Mexico said, that “the activities of the DEA trample our 

sovereignty.”  And ladies and gentlemen, I am here today 

respecting fully the government of Mexico for their sovereignty, 

but they have made their own decisions, as we have made our 

decisions and they are a responsible nation and they would 

not want to blame the United States of America, they are the 

ones that resisted our assistance during that time.  President 

Calderón has most recently reinvigorated this fight against the 

drug-trafficking organizations in Mexico.   But whose decision 

was it to move from, you’re infringing upon our sovereignty, in 

the ‘80s, and DEA get out, we don’t want to have anything to 

do with you, to the partnership that President Calderón wants 

to have.  It was a sovereign decision by the leader of Mexico 

that said we’re going to go to war against the drug cartels.    

That decision should not be blamed on the United States of 

America, it was a Mexican decision.  And then fourthly, it is 

very important to understand, that the culture of corruption 

that has developed in Mexico, the failure of the rule of law in 

Mexico, is one of the largest contributing factors to the violence 

that we see today.   And, I was on the Crime Subcommittee.  I 

asked a question of a cartel member who was brought there to 

testify.  I said what is the greatest weapon that you fear in the 

United States arsenal, or in the law enforcement arsenal.   The 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 13. 

 

 

 

answer came back very quickly, we fear extradition.  And why 

is that.  They did not fear law enforcement in Mexico or in 

Central America.  It was extradition to the United States of 

America, you cannot have a failure of the rule of law, and be 

successful in the fight against drugs.   The cartels have 

operated with impunity, and that is not the fault of the United 

States.  The United States is not at fault for the historic 

problems in Mexico, we are not to blame for what has 

happened.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Asa Hutchinson.  [APPLAUSE]  Speaking now for 

our motion, “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War,” 

Jeffrey Miron who is a Harvard economist and whose views on 

narcotics in this country I think among this panel are probably 

unique.   On most drugs he believes in decriminalization, and 

with decriminalization, no war.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jeffrey 

Miron.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JEFFREY MIRON 

Thank you very much, it’s very nice to be here, see so many 

people interested in this topic.  Let me start by responding very 

briefly to a few of things that Mr. Hutchinson said.  He said 

that in fact there’s evidence that the war on drugs has been 

effective in reducing drug use, as he mentioned that’s not 

really on point, that’s not really the question.   But it’s also not 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 14. 

 

 

 

correct.  There’s tons of evidence, and I’m responsible for some 

of that evidence in my academic writing, on whether attempts 

to reduce consumption of drugs with prohibition are effective, 

and it universally finds little if any effect.   Yes, you can 

cherry-pick certain statistics to find that in some periods drug 

use went down, okay, but in other periods it’s gone up, or 

some other kind of drug use went up, the overall result is 

clearly no evidence for the efficacy of prohibition.   And note 

that over the last 40 years, we have dramatically ramped up 

our efforts to enforce prohibition, so we should have seen some 

effects if those effects were in any way going to be effective.  

Now turning to the proposition itself.  Is America to blame for 

Mexico’s drug wars.   The answer is indisputably yes.  I want 

to argue it in three steps.  First, there’s a fact already 

mentioned, that the US consumes a lot of drugs produced or 

trans-shipped through Mexico.  No one disputes that and 

that’s clearly a part of the issue, but it’s not the whole issue, 

and it’s not the most important part of the issue, why, 

well…one, there’s not really anything we can do about the fact 

that the US consumers choose to consume drugs.   Other 

countries consume some of the drugs from Mexico including 

Mexicans, including Canada or Europe, et cetera.  But it is a 

piece of the story and it is one sense in which you might say 

that the proposition that America is to blame, is correct.  But 

there’s a much, much more important sense.   Why are there 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 15. 

 

 

 

drug wars in Mexico.  Why is there violence in the drug trade 

in the US, and many other countries.  The reason there are 

drug wars is because the drug trade is prohibited.  Whether 

you think drugs should be legal or not, it’s an indisputable 

fact, based on theory and evidence, that when you drive a 

market underground, it becomes violent.   Why does it become 

violent?  Because participants in an underground market 

cannot resolve their disputes with courts, with lawyers, by 

complaining to the Consumer Product Safety Commission or 

things like that.  They can only resolve their disputes by 

shooting each other or by threatening to shoot each other.   We 

see evidence of this from all over history and all over the world.  

The US alcohol industry was not violent before 1920, when we 

passed alcohol prohibition.  It was then dramatically violent for 

14 years, until we repealed alcohol prohibition, and then the 

trade became perfectly nonviolent just like any other legal 

good.   If we look at the history of prohibition of drugs, that 

trade was not violent until we prohibited drugs, and ramped 

up and escalated the war on drugs.  If you look at other 

commodities from gambling to prostitution to blue jeans 

supplied in controlled economies where they were in short 

supply, to commodities driven underground by high tax rates, 

whenever you drive a market underground, that market 

becomes violent because participants resolve their disputes 

with violence, okay, completely independent of the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 16. 

 

 

 

characteristics of the good, whether you’re in favor or not of 

prohibiting that good, it’s just a fact of nature that the 

prohibition creates the violence.   Now the second thing to 

recognize is that the US, far and away above any other 

country, has historically and repeatedly and persistently been 

the country that has foisted prohibition on the entire world.  

Starting in 1919, in Paris, at the signing of the Treaty of 

Versailles which ended World War I, the US said it would not 

sign unless there was a clause in the treaty that required every 

other country to immediately go back and adopt drug 

prohibition.   This is in 1919.  Throughout the history of the 

United Nations the US has made fighting drugs and 

prohibiting drugs in particular a key part of the UN’s mission.  

And very recently, the US has actively tried to push Canada, 

England, other countries, and in particular Mexico, to enforce 

drug prohibition and to adopt drug laws that we approve of.   

Let me read you some quotes that suggest someone else thinks 

this is right as well.  “While every Mexican administration 

since the ‘60s has piously declared that it intended to intensify 

its drug enforcement efforts for domestic motivations, the fact 

is that the real reason has always been American pressure.”  

Okay?  Quote one.  Quote two.  “All this starts to show why 

current US drug policy would have to change in order for 

Mexico to change its stance.   It also explains why it is virtually 

impossible for Mexico to follow a different policy unilaterally.”  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 17. 

 

 

 

Okay?  So who wrote those words, suggesting that the US 

policy, the US insistence, the US pressure on Mexico, is the 

crucial factor, in determining Mexico’s drug policy.   Well, it 

turns out it’s one of my opponents, Jorge Castañeda, in an 

article that I found on the Web a few days ago.  So I don’t 

think that point, that the US has tried very, very hard, not 

always successfully, but has tried consistently, to make sure 

every country adopts drug prohibition--that point is just not 

beyond rational dispute.   So, part of the discussion here 

clearly is about what people think about legalization.  I’ll 

comment on that in a second.  But you actually don’t need to 

take a stand on whether it’s good to have drug legalization or 

drug prohibition, to take a view on the motion.   You should be 

in favor of the motion because it’s just a matter of science and 

the evidence, that the US pressure to enforce prohibition in 

Mexico and the US prohibition in the US, are the reasons for 

the drug violence.  Now some people may argue that violence is 

a cost of doing something that’s worthwhile.   They may argue 

that prohibition reduces drug use, they may argue that drug 

prohibition has some other moral statement or something like 

that.  Many other people including me would argue that 

prohibition mainly does bad things, not only the violence but 

the corruption, the restrictions on medicinal uses of drugs for 

people who are suffering, the infringements on civil liberties 

and on and on.   Okay, and so you would think that for lots of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 18. 

 

 

 

reasons legalization is the right policy.  But you don’t have to 

take a stand on that, regardless of your views on that, the 

correct position about the motion is that the US is indeed the 

single factor to blame for Mexico’s drug wars.  Thank you very 

much.

Thank you, Jeffrey Miron.  A reminder of where we are, we are 

halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence 

Squared US debate, I’m John Donvan of ABC News.  We have 

six debaters, two teams of three, and they’re debating this 

motion, “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.”   You 

have heard three opening statements, and now on to the 

fourth, I’d like to introduce Chris Cox, the argument has 

already been made, that one of the reasons for Mexico’s drug 

war is the availability of an illicit supply of weapons from the 

United States.  Chris Cox is going to debate that point, as chief 

lobbyist for the National Rifle Association.  Chris Cox.    

CHRIS COX 

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Look, we can all agree that Mexico’s 

violent drug war is destroying innocent lives on both sides of 

the border.  But some have suggested tonight that lax US gun 

laws or the lack of enough anti-gun laws are somehow to 

blame for this crisis.   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Yes!   

CHRIS COX 

I’m here to tell you—I’m here to tell you that it’s not just 

wrong, and it’s not just dishonest, it’s also a deliberate 

diversion away from the issues that really matter.  So tonight 

let’s dispose of the lies and start telling the truth on this issue

for a change.   One that you just heard tonight was how 90 

percent of the guns that are used by the drug cartels, come 

from the United States.  Well, and not from CNN but after 

independent fact-checking organizations looked into it, it 

turned out the number wasn’t 90 percent.   It wasn’t even 

close but Fareed, the question shouldn’t be how many guns, 

whether it’s 1 percent or 100 percent the question should be, 

well how can we reduce that number.  That should be the 

question before us and the question is, well, maybe we can 

make smuggling guns into Mexico illegal, but the problem is 

we’ve already made it illegal.   It’s illegal on both sides of the 

border, and you can’t really make something any more illegal 

than it already is.  So let’s be absolutely clear.  If you’re 

smuggling drugs, or running guns or doing anything illegal 

with a gun, whether it’s in Mexico City or New York City, you 

oughta be arrested, prosecuted, and thrown in jail.   I think 

that’s something we can all agree with.  No one more so than 

the National Rifle Association.  Because these armed criminals 

don’t just endanger our families, they endanger our freedoms.  

And that’s why the NRA’s worked to pass meaningful laws, so 

if you misuse a gun in the commission of a crime, you’re going 

to go to jail.   Let me mention just a few that we’ve worked on.  

If you give or even lend a gun to someone that you even think 

isn’t allowed to have one, you can go to jail for 10 years.  If 

you’re arrested for dealing drugs and carrying a gun in this

country, your sentence starts at five years, and that’s just for 

the gun.  Pull the trigger, 10 years.  If you shoot someone, you 

can go to jail for life or get the death penalty.  And that’s not 

three strikes and you’re out, that’s one strike and you’re out.  I 

challenge anyone to look at me with a straight face and say we 

could end the drug war in Mexico if we just pass one more gun 

law in the United States.   It’s absurd, it won’t work, so let’s 

stop pretending that it will.  Ask yourself.  If American 

criminals don’t obey American gun laws, and Mexican 

criminals don’t obey Mexican gun laws, how is it that some 

new gun control law here in the United States is suddenly 

going to be obeyed by both.  It’s not.  Look, if you get caught 

trying to smuggle a gun into Mexico, you’re going to a US jail 

for a long time.  And if you get caught on the Mexican side of 

the border, you could go to a Mexican jail for even longer.  That 

is unless you can afford to make a donation to the Arresting 

Officer Scholarship Fund, [LAUGHTER] which to these drug 

cartels, is nothing more than a small tax on doing business.   

So let’s not dance around the truth.  The truth is they pump 

about $40 billion worth of product into our country.  And it’s 

not just drugs.  This is a sophisticated criminal enterprise, 

that seems to be involved in child prostitution, money-

laundering, trafficking of pirated DVD’s, it’s a sophisticated 

enterprise.   So it’s no wonder, they post profits of somewhere 

between 14 and $25 billion every year.  That’s more profit than

Microsoft makes.  With that kind of money they’re buying 

whoever they want, whatever they want, wherever it is, no 

matter what it costs.   Judging from the weapons that are 

seized, we know what they want.  Fully automatic machine 

guns, RPG’s, hand grenades, armored personnel carriers, 

everything from airplanes to boats.  Now intelligence sources 

say that this type of weaponry comes from the international 

black market.  Places like China and Guatemala.   But I gotta 

tell you the one place it doesn’t come from, are American gun 

shows or some mom-and-pop gun store in Texas or Arizona, 

‘cause you can’t buy fully automatic weapons there, and you 

sure as hell can’t buy hand grenades, RPG’s and helicopter 

gunships.   But there is another place that it’s available.  The 

Mexican government.  According to the New York Times, in the 

last seven years, more than 100,000 soldiers have deserted the 

Mexican army.  Now how many people here think that all 

100,000 turned their guns in before they betrayed their 

country.  It’s ridiculous.  Most of them were Special Forces, 

former Special Forces commandos or many of them went on to 

form their own drug cartel, the Zetas.   Which our government 

says is the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and 

dangerous cartel operating in Mexico.   And the number-one 

organization responsible for most of the narcotic-related 

homicides, beheadings, kidnappings and extortions that take 

place in Mexico.   But it’s not just the military.  The cartels are

working with the current administration as well.  Last year 

more than a dozen ranking or former officials of the Calderón 

administration, were arrested for passing tips on to the drug 

traffickers.   One of them, Mexico’s former drug czar.  So if you 

want to talk seriously about this drug war, you’ve gotta talk 

seriously about the undeniable, institutionalized level of 

corruption, within the Mexican government.  We need to stop 

talking around the issues, we’ve got enough laws.  Everything 

the drug cartels are doing is already illegal, a hundred different 

ways on both sides of the border.   We don’t need more laws, 

we’ve got all the tools we need.  We’ve got the know-how, we’ve 

got the tools, the intelligence.  What’s lacking is the guts, the 

political backbone to look each other in truth, and have an 

honest discussion about this issue.   Instead of talking around 

the issues with some superficial discussion about how gun 

laws, which are going to continue to be ignored by criminals, 

could somehow make the difference.  Nothing—and until we do 

that, nothing’s going to change and people on both sides of the 

border, will continue to pay the price with their lives.  Thank 

you.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Chris Cox.  [APPLAUSE]  Our motion is “America is 

to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War,” and to debate next for the 

motion, Andrés Martinez of the New America Foundation, 

ANDRÉS was born in Mexico but came to this country and 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

went to a bunch of Ivy League schools and then he discovered 

Pittsburgh and the Post-Gazette and became a writer, an 

editorial writer, and since has written and been on the editorial 

boards of papers such as the Wall Street Journal, the 

Washington Post, the New York Times, and I give you, ladies 

and gentlemen, Andrés Martinez.   

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ   

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  First off I want to make clear that I 

understand that some of Professor Castañeda’s students are in 

the auditorium.  And I think it’s very important to reiterate 

and remind you that your vote is secret at the end of this, so—  

[LAUGHTER]   Your grades will not be affected by coming to 

the right side here.  And I want to thank the Rosenkranz 

Foundation for holding this debate.  As John mentioned, I 

grew up in Mexico in the 1970s, in the northern state of 

Chihuahua, and the capitol city of the same name.  And back 

then it was a pretty easygoing mid-size city.   My friends and I 

wouldn’t really think twice about hitchhiking home from 

school, or hopping on a city bus to go downtown to watch a 

movie, then grab a taco at our favorite hole-in-the-wall joint, 

[SPANISH NAME].   Our parents didn’t really worry much 

about us then.  I don’t mean to suggest that Chihuahua was 

Denmark.  The state does sit on the border with the United 

States.  And while the bulk of the hard drug trade in those 

days as Fareed mentioned, went through the Caribbean, there 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 25. 

 

 

 

were plenty of trafficking organizations in the mountains of 

Chihuahua near the city.   But we weren’t really aware of this, 

there was no violence, I didn’t even know anyone who did 

drugs.  I got my first exposure to the consumer end of the 

pipeline when I came to school in the States.  And it’s actually 

important to make clear that, contrary to something that was 

suggested earlier, consumption rates in Mexico still remain 

very low and that’s something we can explore later in the 

debate.   The state of Chihuahua only became a bloody 

battleground, its border city of Ciudad Juarez synonymous 

practically with murder, after the US clamped down on the 

Caribbean routes via Miami once favored by the cartels.   And 

that is what transformed Mexico into the global hub of the 

trade for drugs.  I was talking to a childhood friend recently in 

Chihuahua and he told me that the city bears little 

resemblance to the place that we grew up in, and that he 

doesn’t dare now leave his kids out of sight.   Lest they be 

kidnapped or caught in the crossfire between the cartels, or 

between the cartels and the security forces.  I am proud I grew 

up in Mexico, and I’m even more proud to be an American.  

Which is why it’s doubly painful for me to acknowledge that 

America is responsible for what’s happened to Chihuahua, and 

that America is to blame for Mexico’s drug war.   The United 

States cannot continue to have it both ways.  We Americans 

need to make a choice.  Either we get serious about clamping 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 26. 

 

 

 

down on the consumption of illegal drugs, or we should 

legalize them.  Wherever you come down on the moral health, 

economic merits of criminalizing versus legalizing drugs, 

please acknowledge that a continuation of the hypocritical 

status quo, which criminalizes socially accepted behavior, 

undermines the rule of law, both in our country, and in 

countries overrun by the goons who arbitrage between our 

supposed morality, and our actual behavior.   That may all 

sound a bit abstract.  What’s a little erosion of the rule of law 

between friends.  Until you start counting the corpses piling 

up south of the border.  They are closing in on 15,000 just 

since President Calderón took office in late 2006.  And that’s 

nearly three times the number of US servicemen killed in Iraq 

and Afghanistan this decade.   So let’s not be distracted by talk 

of corruption in Mexico or what percentage of guns in Mexico 

comes from where.  Our debate isn’t about whether Mexico is 

like Denmark, or about America’s gun laws.  It is about what 

happens to a nation that shares a 2,000-mile border with the 

richest nation on earth when that richest nation on earth 

insists on consuming some $65 billion worth of drugs a year, 

and insists on ceding control of that market, of that industry, 

to offshore criminal organizations.  There’s an old saying in 

Mexico, perhaps you’ve heard it.   “Poor Mexico, so far from 

God, so close to the United States.”  [LAUGHTER]  But the real 

curse isn’t merely proximity to America.  It’s being sandwiched 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 27. 

 

 

 

between America’s insatiable demand for illicit drugs, and the 

sources of the most valuable of those drugs, the coca fields in 

Colombia and Bolivia.  So let’s not be confused.  Whatever 

Mexico’s shortcomings are, and there are plenty…and say 

Canada’s virtues, whatever those are—   If our two neighboring 

countries…traded places, we’d be here talking about a 

Canadian war tonight.  Geography sometimes is destiny.  As 

Americans we believe in individual empowerment and the 

concept that our actions have consequences.   As consumers 

we may shun products that harm the environment, maybe you 

buy fair-trade coffee.  You know, we believe that our choices 

have consequences.  On college campuses students have long 

thought globally but acted locally.  You know, they mobilize 

against overseas sweatshops…   Or they press institutions to 

to divest from investments that may harm people in Darfur or 

elsewhere.  When I was in college in the States, the issue of the 

day was divestment from South Africa.  Activists erected 

shantytowns on campus to pressure the college to stop 

investing in companies that were doing business there.  Again, 

a laudable impulse.  But even then I was struck by how some 

of these activists disregarded their socially responsible 

investment creed, when it came to recreational drugs.   Their 

cash after all was underwriting the murder of elected officials, 

judges, and policemen in Colombia.  As Fareed said back then 

that was the hub, and now it’s shifted to Mexico.  And I do

worry that we still haven’t made that connection.   I actually 

shared this view with a girlfriend at the time in college, as an 

argument for our not indulging, and that may have hastened 

the demise of our relationship.  [LAUGHTER]  She didn’t quite 

call me Buzzkill Martinez but maybe she did and I’ve omitted 

that memory.  [LAUGHTER]   I must say though, President 

Obama to his credit has acknowledged this nexus.  Saying that 

as the ultimate consumers of the drugs flowing north, we have 

a shared responsibility with Mexico in confronting its war.  So 

we should count him as a member of our team here tonight.  

[LAUGHTER]   And even Ronald Reagan back in 1988 meeting 

with President de la Madrid said similar things, that the 

solution to the problem was for Americans to quit buying 

illegal drugs.  And I would suggest another option, as has been 

suggested, is decriminalization.  But we can’t continue to have 

it both ways.   I recently read a best-selling book in Mexico by 

an author I respect a great deal, and from whom I’ve learned a 

lot.  And on page 85 of that book, he wrote that the US wants 

Mexico… “to wage the war and provide the corpses, so it 

doesn’t have to.”   And he refers to the US as exporting its 

internal conflict on drugs.  The author of this book, and I’m 

sorry, Jorge, to pile on, but—  [LAUGHTER]  You’re such 

prolific writer.  [LAUGHTER]  The book is excellent.  Is Jorge 

Castañeda of course, and, there’s still time, Jorge, for you to 

switch sides and come over to—  [LAUGHTER]  to join us and

Presidents Obama and Reagan.  [LAUGHTER]  But I look 

forward to continuing this conversation, and thank you so 

much for your interest.   

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Andrés Martinez.  Well, our next debater is Jorge 

Castañeda and as you’ve heard his words keep coming back to 

bite him tonight, that’s because he writes [LAUGHTER] an 

awful lot, Jorge served as Mexico’s Foreign Minister in the 

early 2000’s, also your dad as well held that position back in 

the ‘70s, am I correct—   

JORGE CASTAÑEDA 

That’s right.    

JOHN DONVAN  

He is also on the faculty here at New York University, ladies 

and gentlemen, Jorge Castañeda.  

[APPLAUSE]   

JORGE CASTAÑEDA 

Very quickly first for my students, in Mexico we have ways of 

knowing how you vote.  [LAUGHTER]  Be careful.  Secondly, 

this is a tilted playing field.  Because on that side, I have two of 

my current and former bosses and that’s not fair.  

[LAUGHTER]   Andrés Martinez is my boss at the New America 

Foundation, and Fareed had been my boss at Newsweek 

magazine for a long, long period of time.  So obviously, you 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 30. 

 

 

 

know, I feel somewhat constrained.  [LAUGHTER]   My point is 

very simple here.  The United States is not to blame for 

Mexico’s drug war, Mexico is not to blame for Mexico’s drug 

war, President Felipe Calderón is to blame for Mexico’s drug 

war, a war of choice that he should not have declared, that 

cannot be won, and is doing enormous damage to Mexico.   It 

was started on false premises, that Mexican consumption had 

grown by 2006 which is false according to the government’s 

own health statistics.  Not only has Mexican consumption not 

grown, it is lower than the consumption not only of the United 

States and Western Europe, but of practically all of Latin 

America.   It was premised on an increase in violence in 

Mexico through 2006, which is also false.  Willful homicides 

had been decreasing Mexico, for the previous 15 years, down 

to levels way below those of Central America, Brazil, Colombia, 

et cetera, though still higher than the United States.   Thirdly, 

it was premised on a loss of state capacity to enforce the law in 

Mexico, from what you’ve heard here and quite rightly on both 

sides of the table, that state capacity in Mexico has never been 

immense, and it’s not necessarily worse today than it was 

before.   Yes, there is corruption in Mexico, the point is there is 

more corruption today than there was 20, 25 years ago.  I say 

no there isn’t.  And finally, this was also a war that was 

predicated on the issue, that there was a current explosion of 

war, which had to be stopped, it cannot be stopped.  Why did 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 31. 

 

 

 

President Calderón declare this war of choice?  Because he felt 

that he needed to legitimize himself in the view of the Mexican 

people, because his election was questioned.   Fareed, I’m 

sorry on this point, I tried to run against President— 

Candidate Calderón, and wasn’t allowed to, and supported him 

actively, and wrote in many of the places I wrote and that you 

all quote, that I actively supported, called on readers to vote 

for him, supported him actively, during the campaign, during 

the election, and during the post-election discussion on 

whether the election was free and fair, which I thought it was.   

I thought he won, most Mexicans thought he won, but he 

decided that he had to legitimize himself in the eyes of the 

Mexican people for a questioned election.  And he thought that 

this was the way to do it, by calling the Army out into the 

streets, donning a military uniform for the first time in 50 

years of Mexican history, and trying to achieve, through the 

war on drugs, what he could have achieved in a much more 

useful way.  This war cannot be won, simply because it is  

failing to comply with the fundamental tenets of a very good 

friend of mine, that some of you may know, Colin Powell’s view 

of the first Gulf War.  To go into war like this, you need to have 

overwhelming force, we don’t have it.   You need to have a 

definition of victory, we don’t have it.  You need to have an exit 

strategy, we don’t have it.  And you should have the support of 

the Mexican people in this case, which President Calderón 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 32. 

 

 

 

does have, but he’s running out of it very quickly.   Is the US 

to blame for this?  I tend to think it’s not directly to blame, 

although there is a case to be made for the consumption and 

arms argument.  The problem with the consumption 

argument, is that if the United States is going to reduce 

consumption significantly, well, it’s time to do so.   And frankly 

that doesn’t seem to be what American society wants to do.  I 

don’t see the United States wanting to reduce American 

consumption or demand.  Frankly, if I was an American citizen 

and was asked to vote on this question, I would vote against 

reducing US consumption.   Why bother?  There’re much more 

intelligent things to do with US consumption, I believe, than 

trying to reduce it.  For example, legalize or decriminalize the 

consumption of as many drugs as is reasonable right now.  

Start with what you can, see what happens, and then move 

forward.  Is there an alternative issue—approach, of course 

there is.  We don’t have to proceed the way President Calderón 

has, we don’t have to proceed the way both the Bush and 

Obama administration, who on this point, are exactly identical 

in their policy toward Mexico…   We don’t have to proceed the 

way Calderón has proceeded and the way Bush and Obama 

have supported him.  We don’t have to declare a war on all the 

cartels all the time as Carlos Fuentes has said.  We can do 

either what the Colombians did, combat collateral damages.  

We can pursue a policy of harm reduction in Mexico.   And we 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 33. 

 

 

 

can pursue a policy in the United States, Mexicans, we 

Mexicans, of trying to lobby in the United States in favor of 

decriminalization where it can be done.  But we certainly don’t 

have to go to war with more than 15,000 people already killed 

in drug-related killings, and the number rising every week, 

every month, every year.   We have far more executions today 

in Mexico, than we had four years ago.  But the last point I 

want to make is the most absurd one.  We have tens of people 

dying every day in Tijuana.  On the border, with the United 

States.  Sometimes, 50, 60, 70.   And, they are there basically 

dying to stop Mexican marijuana, among other drugs, from 

entering the United States.  The small problem is that 120 

miles north of Tijuana, in Los Angeles, there are more public, 

legal dispensaries of medical marijuana than public schools.  

There are more than a thousand medical dispensaries of 

marijuana in Los Angeles, perfectly legal.   So we have our 

guys dying south of the border, to stop the marijuana from 

entering the United States, and being sold legally in Los 

Angeles.  I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with 

that idea, it doesn’t work, it’s a war that cannot be won, it’s a 

war that should not have been waged, and it’s a war that we 

should call off promptly.   The United States is not to blame for 

it, Mexico is not to blame for it, it’s a war of choice that 

President Calderón declared for strictly political reasons, thank 

you.

[APPLAUSE]   

JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, Jorge Castañeda.  And that concludes Round 1 of 

this Intelligence Squared debate.  Our motion is, “America is to 

Blame for Mexico’s Drug War,” and we now have the results of 

where you our live audience stood before this debate began.  

You are the judges in this debate, you’re voting both before 

and again at the end, and the team that changes the most of 

your minds will be declared our winner.   Here are the results 

where things started at the beginning.  Our motion is “America 

is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War,” at the start, 43 percent of 

you were for…22 percent against, and 35 percent undecided.  

So we’ll have you vote once again at the end of the debate, and 

the team that changes the most minds will be declared our 

winner.   On now to Round 2 of this Intelligence Squared US 

debate, it’s our middle round, in which the debaters talk 

directly to one another, can challenge one another, and also 

we’ll take questions from myself and from you in the audience, 

and I’d like to start by asking you, Fareed, the point that Jorge 

Castañeda just made that, Mexico’s drug war basically is the 

fault of one man…do you buy it?   

FAREED ZAKARIA  

I’m a little confused listening to that whole team because, Asa 

Hutchinson says, consumption is down.  Jorge Castañeda says 

consumption is up.  I mean I’ve welcomed diversity but this is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 35. 

 

 

 

ridiculous.  [LAUGHTER]   And more fundamentally it seems 

as though there is a contradiction here which is…Asa 

Hutchinson says, the problem, the reason Mexico has become 

this hellhole is because it did not declare war on drugs and did 

not prosecute efficiently and did not take the fight to the 

enemy.   So then they do that, and Jorge Castañeda says, 

that’s the problem.  I think it just proves that this is all 

kabuki.  What we are talking about fundamentally is, these 

countries, among the poorer countries in the world, they are 

trying to fulfill insatiable demand for $65 billion of product.   If 

it goes away from Mexico we will be back here next year, and 

we will be talking about, you know, the drug war in Peru, or 

somewhere else, because, the supply—Asa Hutchinson, as a 

Republican you surely believe, that, if there is a huge amount 

of demand from the richest country in the world, somebody is 

going to figure out a way to supply it.   

JOHN DONVAN  

All right, team—team—   

FAREED ZAKARIA  

That somebody is Mexico right now and we’re blaming them.

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 36. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN 

Team against, Fareed Zakaria has just said you’re 

contradicting each other.  Asa Hutchinson, can you find unity.  

[LAUGHTER]    

ASA HUTCHINSON 

Well, I think first of all, among the six of us up here there’s 

probably a different position on this issue for each one of us.  

But what this side is united upon is the proposition, and we 

have to come back to the proposition, that America is to blame 

for Mexico’s drug war.  And there is unity on this side that that 

is not the case.  Whether you take the argument that it is the 

decision of President Calderón, or whether it’s the fact of the 

historic problems in Mexico, their lack of cooperation or lack of 

the rule of law, America is not to blame.  Now let me see if 

there’s unity on your side, Fareed.  I just want to make it clear 

that if you’re saying America’s to blame to me that implies that 

there’s something wrong with our governmental policy.  Now 

you can argue that as individual citizens, we should be making 

better decisions not to use drugs.  But as you have libertarians 

on your side, that’s an individual citizen, not a governmental 

decision.  So I assume that you’re saying our government is 

doing something wrong.   We’ve had a balanced approach, 

strategy, of supply reduction, demand reduction, trying to 

teach young people to make good decisions, and rehabilitation.  

Do you want to move away from that to legalize marijuana, to

legalize cocaine, to legalize heroin, to legalize 

methamphetamine, to legalize Ecstasy that comes from other 

countries.   What is the position of your team, do you want to 

legalize all drugs, is that the shift in policy that you—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jeffrey—   

ASA HUTCHINSON  

—wish to take.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jeffrey Miron.    

JEFFREY MIRON  

I don’t want to speak for others on that question—   

ASA HUTCHINSON  

I want an answer from Fareed first too, though.    

JOHN DONVAN  

No, let me, I want to go to the libertarian.   

JEFFREY MIRON 

My—  [LAUGHTER]  My position, separate from—independent 

of this debate is that we should legalize all drugs.  I think the 

unity amongst the three of us although we probably differ in 

nuances of that view, is that,  [00:57:52:26]  unquestionably 

the magnitude of resources we devote to prohibition is 

grotesquely excessive, that the set of things that we prohibit is 

substantially excessive, that there may be a role for 

government to try to address the negatives associated with 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 38. 

 

 

 

drug use, through treatment, through harm reduction, 

through various policies, but that the current practice of 

spending tens of billions, by my estimates about $80 billion a 

year, locking people up, to try to get rid of the drug trade, is an 

incredibly counterproductive policy and we should stop.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Chris Cox, what’s wrong with that argument?   

CHRIS COX  

Well, I’d like to point out what may be another contradiction, 

Fareed seems to think that gun control is—   

JOHN DONVAN  

No, no, I want you to answer the question, what’s wrong with 

that argument.  [LAUGHTER]

charging me with—    

JOHN DONVAN 

Please—  

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

Can I butt in on that too—  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]    

FAREED ZAKARIA  

I mean, you—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Take it, Fareed—   

FAREED ZAKARIA  

—you might be surprised but Asa, I would join with the former 

presidents of Brazil and Mexico and Colombia, who recently 

put out a report in which they said, we just need a paradigm 

shift here because what we have done is criminalize and 

terrorize this entire process, by waging war on drugs, and what 

we need to start doing, is a comprehensive review of whether 

there are ways to decriminalize it.   Look, many people have 

decriminalized drugs, I would be in favor of a controlled, slow, 

incremental approach, to see what happens.  But I think 

there’s no question, that our current approach, massive 

criminalization, massive prohibitions, and most importantly 

the exporting of that war to other countries, is producing all 

the violence, it’s producing the criminality as Jeff pointed out.   

The reason this whole business is violent and criminal is 

because we have prosecuted it as a war.  That is to me the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 40. 

 

 

 

fundamental responsibility we have, which we cannot shirk 

from.  There are people dying in Mexico because of those 

choices that we have made.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Chris Cox, your expertise is the weapons issue, and the 

others—you made an argument that, laws restricting weapons 

won’t work, the other side is making more a simple argument, 

the very presence of American, of weapons sourced in the 

United States, are responsible for the war to some degree.   

Can you take on that question, the weapons are there—are 

those weapons part of the reason that—and they’re in the 

hands of the cartels—are those weapons part of the reason, 

that the war is going on and being prosecuted.   

CHRIS COX  

Well there’s no question when drug cartels are armed with 

hand grenades, when they’re armed with RPG’s, fully 

automatic weapons, that there’s a devastating effect on not 

only the drug cartels themselves fighting with one another but 

the innocent people in Mexico, who have no ability to defend 

themselves whatsoever.   But the question becomes more of a 

common-sense type question.  Is there something that the US 

can do, from a more gun control standpoint, that’s going to 

work any better than what works now, there’s a total ban—    

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay—

CHRIS COX  

It’s not working in Mexico.   

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ  

All right—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Andrés Martinez.    

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

Yeah, first off, I think Asa is twisting the proposition a bit by 

bringing it back constantly to the American government.  

“America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War,” the “America” 

there is, is a larger entity, it’s all of society.  There are 

government policies but there’s also individual behavior and 

societal norms, and the disconnect between our laws and our 

behavior.   And as a good Republican I would think that you 

wouldn’t necessarily always equate America with the American 

government.  [LAUGHTER]  I think the dynamic—  [APPLAUSE]  

The dynamic here is there’s a pattern of behavior in terms of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 42. 

 

 

 

that this bilateral relationship.   Where the United States 

historically has seen Mexico as a kind of back-yard Las Vegas 

where, the usual rules don’t apply, what happens in Mexico 

can stay in Mexico.  So we can export our, our unresolved 

contradictions down there.   People in Mexico are bearing the 

burdens of our conflict on drugs, and the fact that we have 

dysfunctional laws, it’s Mexicans doing the dying for our 

unresolved—  We can’t bear as a society to go without these 

drugs, but we also can’t bring ourselves to legalize them.  

And—    

JOHN DONVAN  

Andrés, Andrés, I—   

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ  

—what’s the cost of this—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—you’re not actually answering Chris’s question, Chris, restate 

your question—   

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ  

I don’t—  

JOHN DONVAN 

—in one sentence—    

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ I didn’t have an opportunity to talk 

about the—  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]    

CHRIS COX 

Okay, my question was, there’s basically a total gun ban in 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 43. 

 

 

 

Mexico now.  How effective is that working and do you think 

that we should bring that sort of gun ban to America, when if 

you look at cities like Juarez, Mexico, which are just 

devastated with cri—with drug cartel violence, and El Paso 

which is just a stone’s throw across the Rio Grande, that’s the 

third safest city in America, how do you rectify—   

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ  

Well you’re also trying to twist the proposition into making it 

“America’s Gun Laws are to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.”  I 

think there’s a broader issue here, I mean I would follow the 

money, not necessarily the guns.  There are an awful lot of 

American guns making their way to Mexico.  However, it is 

true, that if you’re making $20-30 billion in the United States 

because American society has decided that this one industry 

that it doesn’t want to go away is going to be ceded to criminal 

organizations, you would be able to buy those guns elsewhere, 

I will grant you that.   If the United States had the toughest 

gun control laws in the entire world…the Mexican drug cartels 

would still be armed to the teeth.  What they’re really getting 

out of the United States, first and foremost, is guns, the fact 

that it’s very convenient for them to pick up guns while they’re 

here tallying up their profits, that just adds insult to injury.    

JOHN DONVAN  

Jorge Castañeda.   

JORGE CASTAÑEDA 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 44. 

 

 

 

I would sort of go back to another question, my impression is 

that, at least on that side, you all seem to agree that this is a 

failed war.  Which is certainly what I think, it’s the title of my 

book.   I quote at length, Zedillo, Cardoso and Gaviria 

document at the end, who also said it’s a failed war.  And I 

think that this is—failed wars should not be waged.  If you 

continue, if you persevere in a failed war, you will continue to 

fail.  So I think the key issue there is, what should Mexico and 

the United States, and basically the two governments because 

there, Andrés, it’s difficult to decide on the part of American 

society or Mexican society, that’s why you vote, that’s why we 

vote now.  We didn’t always—   We always voted but 

sometimes we voted for people or sometimes people voted for 

us but anyway.  [LAUGHTER]  Or the government did.  But, 

the fact is that now the question is what should the 

governments do.   And the problem is that the Obama 

administration and the Calderón administration are in total 

synch in continuing this failed war.  Pouring money into it, 

having more people die in Mexico because of it, while at the 

same time—and I agree with the Obama administration— at 

the same time, President Obama and Attorney General Holder 

say they are not going to apply federal anti-marijuana laws in 

those states that have legalized medical marijuana.  Which I 

think is wonderful by the way.   What I don’t understand is 

why President Obama and Attorney General Holder on the one 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

hand do that, and on the other hand, give money to Calderón 

to wage a failed war on drugs.  I think that’s the real question, 

not so much if I may be allowed to say so, who is to blame for 

Mexico’s drug war, which perhaps was not the right way to 

phrase the debate.    

JOHN DONVAN  

I’ll come back to you, Asa, Jeffrey Miron.  [LAUGHTER]  I will 

come back to you.   

ASA HUTCHINSON  

Just want to say I agree with that—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Okay, let—  Are— you wanted to say very briefly?   

ASA HUTCHINSON  

Oh no, I just for once I do agree with my debate partner—  

[LAUGHTER]  I think he sorta nailed it—   

JOHN DONVAN 

It’s so nice when it works out that way.    

JEFFREY MIRON  

You just heard—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Jeffrey Miron—   

JEFFREY MIRON  

Just heard Mr. Hutchinson say it that they’ve only agreed with 

each other once so far this evening.  To go back to the gun 

point.  What Christopher Cox is arguing is that if you take a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 46. 

 

 

 

substance, a commodity, that a large number of people want to 

own, and you prohibit it, a whole bunch of consequences 

happen.   The market goes underground, it may shrink a bit, 

you may make it more costly, but it’s not going to disappear.  

It’s going to go underground.  Then there will be corruption, as 

people try to evade those laws, there will be violence as people 

in the underground market resolve their disputes.   There will 

be poor quality control and so on and so forth.  Mr. Cox makes 

that argument, with respect to guns.  Okay, he’s opposed to 

strenuous gun laws to prohibiting guns, but exactly the same 

arguments, apply to prohibiting drugs.   The structure of the 

argument, the logic of the argument, is totally compelling, and 

it’s right for both commodities, not just one, and not just the 

others, so libertarians think that guns should be legal, and 

drugs should be legal.  I hope that my opponent agrees with 

that proposition.    

CHRIS COX Actually, I agree—  [LAUGHTER]  I agree with 

quite a bit of Jeff’s arguments, certainly—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Chris Cox—   

CHRIS COX  

—not with regards to guns but I certainly agree with your study—   

FAREED ZAKARIA  

Oh, they’re dropping like flies on that side— [LAUGHTER]    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 47. 

 

 

 

CHRIS COX  

Actually—there is a contradiction, believe it or not there is a 

contradiction on the other side.  Fareed has pointed out some 

false statistics to suggest that more gun control laws would 

somehow have a major impact in this drug war.  Ice agents 

have said we already have—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Fareed, did you make that—   

JEFFREY MIRON  

I don’t think he said—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Did you make the point about gun control—   

FAREED ZAKARIA  

No, my point was the one you raised, the general prevalence of 

280 million guns here, which is about a third of all guns 

worldwide, the fact that we share a border with one of the 

poorer countries in the world, and there is vast drug trade and 

vast cartels means…this is an easy way to criminalize and to 

accelerate the violence of this trade.    

JOHN DONVAN  

All right, I interrupted you because I didn’t hear Fareed make 

that argument, so [UNCLEAR]—   

CHRIS COX  

Okay, what I heard Fareed say was parrot many of the 

arguments that have been made by the gun control community 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 48. 

 

 

 

but perhaps that’s not a fair reflection on Fareed’s own 

personal views but the contradiction is that, to suggest that we 

have a lot of guns, therefore, we’re part of the problem is to 

suggest that more gun control would make us less of a 

problem, and I think what Jeff has argued, certainly in his 

past writings is that, homicide rates amongst countries with 

the highest gun control, tend to be higher than homicide rates 

with those countries with the lowest gun control.   So that’s 

certainly an area where I agree with Jeff but I would not agree 

with Jeff that, [LAUGHTER]  crystal meth, crystal meth addicts 

all over this country that are devastating communities all over 

this country are somehow a fair comparison to law-abiding 

gun owners in this country.    

JEFFREY MIRON 

Can I—could I respond to that, I mean—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Yes, please do.   

JEFFREY MIRON 

Throughout the last—   

CHRIS COX  

We talked about—   

JEFFREY MIRON 

—90 years—   

CHRIS COX  

—legalizing drugs—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 49. 

 

 

 

JEFFREY MIRON 

—the drug prohibitionists have identified one—   

CHRIS COX  

—we’re [UNCLEAR] talking about legalizing crystal meth?   

JOHN DONVAN 

Sorry?   

CHRIS COX  

We’re talking about legalizing crystal meth now—   

JEFFREY MIRON  

Yes.  Yes, because if you go back and read what people were 

writing in the 1950s—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Jeffrey Miron—  

JEFFREY MIRON  

—about marijuana.  They were saying things absolutely as 

strong, absolutely worse than what people are claiming now 

about crystal meth, if you look at the data on the—    

CHRIS COX  

Whoa-hoahhh—   

JEFFREY MIRON  

—number of people who use crystal meth, there’s zillions of 

people using it every day and a teeny fraction of them are 

doing the kinds of things that you’re describing.   The drug 

prohibitionists for 90 years have constantly had a moving 

target, as soon as they identify one drug and say this is the 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

killer drug, this is the one that’s the most evil, this is the one 

that’s going to destroy society.   

JOHN DONVAN  

But, relevant to—   

JEFFREY MIRON  

And there’s some violence—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—relevant to our motion—   

JEFFREY MIRON  

—associated with trying to prohibit that—   

JOHN DONVAN 

—relevant to our motion, Jeffrey’s point is that if you 

decriminalize, the need for war would go away because the bad 

guys wouldn’t have to defend and fight out on the streets, they 

could do it in courtrooms.   

CHRIS COX  

But, and—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Do— what do you think of that.   

CHRIS COX  

Again, I think the point’s almost irrelevant.  The point is, 

whether or not the weapons that we’re suggesting, and Jeff has 

written as well that… violence—  Weapons don’t create 

violence, violence creates a need for weapons and that these 

weapons are coming as even Andrés has pointed out from 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 51. 

 

 

 

other areas, not only Central America but Russian, the former 

Soviet blocs that dumped guns in Mexico during the Cold War 

by the millions, if certainly by the tens of thousands.   These 

weapons are there, and so, it’s really—I tend to agree with 

Jorge, we’re missing the point here—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Right.    

CHRIS COX 

Is America to blame, of course we’re not—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Well let me ask Asa, the whole decriminalization question 

seems to get your hackles up.    

ASA HUTCHINSON 

Well—  [LAUGHTER]  I think—   

JOHN DONVAN 

His point is not whether it’s good or bad for the users, his 

point is whether it would make the war go away.    

ASA HUTCHINSON 

And I’m going to get to that, but I would think—  [LAUGHTER]  

I would think, I was hoping that we would have agreement that 

cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin are harmful drugs and our 

goal in society would be to reduce the usage of those drugs.   

JEFFREY MIRON 

Well do you think—    



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 52. 

 

 

 

ASA HUTCHINSON 

After hearing Jeffrey say—   

JEFFREY MIRON 

—alcohol and tobacco are harmful drugs—   

ASA HUTCHINSON 

After Jeffrey argues that methamphetamine is not as harmful 

as everybody says, and that would include the 

decriminalization, we can’t even reach an agreement on that 

point.   But if you want to reduce usage, for example Alaska in 

the ‘70s voted to decriminalize marijuana.  And once they did 

that guess what happened.  The usage went up, parents did 

not like what they saw, and so the Alaskan voters voted to 

recriminalize that offense.   Because usage went up, and that 

should not be the goal of parents, that’s the concern of 

parents.  In terms of the drug trafficking and the war, I would 

make the argument it might have some peripheral impact, it 

depends on the extent that you legalize, if you just legalize 

marijuana, they’re not going to go away.  Guess what, they’ve 

got cocaine, they’ve got heroin, et cetera, to market.   If you 

legalize all of them, guess what.  You still have prescription 

drugs there would be a black market on, that are totally 

regulated.  They’re moving into other areas from alien 

trafficking, they’re business people.  And the only solution to 

the war on drugs, is the rule of law.   And Mexico does not 

have that right now.  I want them to have that, Calderón seems 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 53. 

 

 

 

to want them to have it.  The fight is on the rule of law and 

unless you establish that, decriminalization is not going to rid 

Mexico of the drug war.   

JOHN DONVAN  

Andrés, just one second, I’m going to come right to you, I want 

to go after Andrés speaks to questions from the audience, I 

want to remind you once again, raise your hand, I’ll find you, a 

microphone will be handed over to you, stand up, if you’re a 

member of the news media please identify yourself, and please 

make it a question.  Andrés.   

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

I totally agree that the issue is the rule of law but it’s the rule 

of law in this country, it’s our failure to uphold the rule of law 

that is to blame for Mexico’s drug war.  We are the ones with 

an addiction rate of illicit drugs that’s six times higher than in 

Mexico.  We are the ones who are abusing this stuff, but can’t 

bring ourselves to legalize it, and it’s people in Mexico who are 

dying for that.   We as a society, and I don’t think--you can be 

agnostic about whether or not drugs should be legalized, if 

that were the subject, the proposition tonight, I’m not sure 

which side I would be on.  You can be agnostic on that, and 

still recognize the, the basic fact that the United States is to 

blame for the war on drugs.   And I’m glad you mentioned 

immigration because you say, well, they’re diversifying into 

human trafficking.  Well geez, I wonder why, again.  Our

failure to enact an immigration reform that matches supply 

and demand, again, we—again, back to my point about—    

ASA HUTCHINSON 

You’re blaming the United States for a lot of ills, in the world—    

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

Well…let’s think about this, we are as addicted to Mexican 

low-cost labor as we are to imported drugs—   

ASA HUTCHINSON 

And Mexico has no—   

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

—but we fail—but we—   

ASA HUTCHINSON 

—responsibility whatsoever—?  

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

But we cannot—  [APPLAUSE]  But we cannot bring ourselves 

to create legal channels for that.  So either we have to decide, 

let’s close down the border, not import low-cost labor, and it’s 

the similar—it’s a parallel debate to what’s happening on the 

drug front.

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

[INAUDIBLE]   

ASA HUTCHINSON 

Thank you, sir, it is actually a very good point that, if the 

United States did not regard Mexican sovereignty, and we 

wanted to solve the transit and source country problems we 

would send our troops there.  But they’re a sovereign nation 

and we cannot go in there without an act of— declaration of 

war or some good cause which doesn’t exist, we’re not doing 

that, we’re regarding their sovereignty.   But whenever we have 

a high regard for their sovereignty, that means America is not 

to blame.  And yes, it wasn’t President Fox that I—I did go to 

see him but, Camarena was killed under a previous 

administration, I was not administrator then.   But I know that 

history very well because it lives in the hearts of every DEA 

agent.  And the fact is that he was murdered brutally, but 

more importantly, we wanted to assist Mexico and we were not 

allowed to do so because of the sovereignty of that country.   

Responsibility is something that’s shared, blame is something 

that is uniquely America’s fault, and that is not the case here.

sovereignty, we have a hundred thousand troops in there, 

NATO and the US, we will have 130,000 troops in there.  And 

yet, we have not been able to do anything about the opium 

trade.  I doubt very much if we send American troops into 

Mexico it would change the fundamental fact, where there is 

demand there will be supply—

JORGE CASTAÑEDA  

Just as a point of factual issues here.  To the best of my 

knowledge, and although I was not present at all of the 

meetings but between my father, my brother and myself we 

have been present at most of the summit meetings between 

American and Mexican presidents over the last 30 years, I do 

not recall ever the United States having asked for US troops to 

go to Mexico, firstly.  And secondly, strangely enough, though 

obviously I stand by what you both quoted, in the case of 

President Calderón, in December of 2006, my impression, I 

don’t know this as a fact.   My impression is actually, that the 

Bush people did not pressure him into declaring this war.  

This was a decision he made absolutely on his own.  Unlike

what had happened on other occasions under Echeverría, 

López Portillo, mainly de la Madrid, and then again on—under 

Salinas, my impression back then, the US did pressure these 

Mexican presidents to engage in more active drug enforcement, 

but the Bush people, not because they believed in not holding,  

pursuing this war, but perhaps because they had other wars 

to pursue, [LAUGHTER]  which were concentrating their 

attention at the time—   

JOHN DONVAN  

Okay, halfway up the aisle there—

JOHN DONVAN  

And will you be able to relate this to our question about whether 

America is to blame.

Well—

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Transformation of the Mexican economy over the last several 

decades, I mean, America has a lot to do with that.  And so I’m 

wondering if that transformation plays a role, in this drug 

violence, ‘cause a lotta these other factors, doing drugs, the 

transfer of guns, they seem fairly static, whereas, you know, 

the violence in Mexico has increased tremendously over the 

last few years, what is not static, what is changing—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Okay.  Andrés Martinez.   

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

Well, I think it’s true that Mexico has, really undergone a 

tremendous transformation, it’s a poor country compared to the 

US but it’s actually, if you look at it in global terms, it’s a fairly 

successful, relatively successful middle-income country plodding 

along, it’s just a stark contrast that it shares a border with the 

US.  I think that the United States has opened up Mexico’s 

economy through NAFTA and through other ways so, it probably 

has given—the Mexican cartels have been able to take advantage 

of that—I don’t—I think it’s a little bit of a side issue to our main 

discussion here.   But if you think about Mexico becoming a 

logistical hub for this global enterprise, a lot of what’s changed in 

Mexico has probably accelerated that and aided it.  But—  

JOHN DONVAN 

Does this mean NAFTA is to blame for Mexico’s drug war—

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ  

But it’s—  [LAUGHTER]  You know, I think just because it’s a lot 

easier for a lotta people in Mexico now to do business, likewise 

for the drug cartels, but I think this is a bit of a side issue.   

JOHN DONVAN 

Okay.   There’s a gentleman, with the eyeglasses, and your hand 

is up, doing one of these.  And the mic’s coming down to you.  

And again I urge you to be… question terse—   

TONY AMATO 

Hi, my name’s Tony Amato, I’m a Penn State student.  My 

question is to the panel that is motioning against.  What I want to 

know is… the amount of money that’s made in the drug trade, is 

astronomical.  If you were to legalize or decriminalize or end 

prohibition on drugs, how would these drug cartels pay for this 

organization.   I mean you did comment and say they, they could 

traffic people, they could traffic illegal goods, but the bulk of the 

money, comes from illegal drugs, so if you take the revenue 

stream out, how could they finance the, the organization, that’s 

what I’d like to know.  

JOHN DONVAN 

Okay, so Jorge Castañeda, why don’t you take that—   

JORGE CASTAÑEDA  

Well—  

JOHN DONVAN 

—and Asa, do you want to also—

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 62. 

 

 

 

JORGE CASTAÑEDA  

I think it would be very difficult for them to finance which is why 

I also favor growing decriminalization or depenalization, I think 

that it would help, it’s easy or relatively easy I think with the 

marijuana and heroin issues, cocaine and methamphetamine 

issues are complicated, they’re more complicated.  But you can 

start with something and see where it goes.   The main point is I 

think you’re absolutely right, a lot of the profits would diminish.  

They’d go into the other businesses, yes, that’s absolutely true 

what Asa what saying.  But the core business remains drugs.  

Let’s not get that part wrong, that’s the core business, and if you 

legalize that then, yes, you will probably have them making less 

money.   

JOHN DONVAN  

The other side care to respond, if not I’ll move on.  Okay.    

JEFFREY MIRON 

The experience of US alcohol prohibition, was that the vast 

majority—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Jeffrey Miron—    

JEFFREY MIRON  

—of the illegal alcohol producers, became legal alcohol 

producers, and there was not a big surge in violence as they went 

into some other industry because initially there were not other 

industries that were highly prohibited for which they could make

a lot of profit, they had to make an honest living in legal 

industries and the rates of returns were modest.   

ASA HUTCHINSON 

La Cosa Nostra, organized crime, came into existence and 

benefited tremendously after Prohibition, they had plenty of work 

to do, organized crime in the United States, even after 

Prohibition.

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

The term “black market” invariably means, free markets that 

have been driven underground as Mr. Miron has eloquently 

demonstrated, particularly with the example of Prohibition.  That 

happens because of bad laws or I would say, immoral laws.   Mr. 

Miron, can you relate, the discussion has been more on practical 

matters, this works, that doesn’t work.  But this is a moral issue 

and it’s an issue of individual rights, can you relate…the drug 

laws to individual rights and perhaps being a libertarian you 

might be able to relate it to the objectivist position.

JEFFREY MIRON 

Um…  [LAUGHS]  I’m actually more of a consequential libertarian 

than a rights-based libertarian, but we shouldn’t probably get 

into that—   

JOHN DONVAN 

Well, we’re getting some real inside libertarian baseball here.   

JEFFREY MIRON 

Yeah.  [LAUGHTER]  But I think that your question can be 

phrased in one of two ways, one way some people think about 

this issue of drug use is to say, individuals have rights to 

consume what they want, to do what they want as long as they’re 

not harming innocent third parties.   A different way that people 

would say it is that, we should prohibit actions which negatively 

impact third parties without really using the word “rights.”  We 

should let them consume what they want because it makes them 

happy, we don’t necessarily have to use those words, but they 

lead you to exactly the same positions.   Both the moral 

perspective and the sort of mundane, practical perspective.  We 

think about what the policies are, the policies have different 

consequences, and you can include morality as one of those sets 

of consequences.  But the libertarian position is we should look 

at all the sets of consequences, not just the feel-good 

consequences—not just the alleged consequences, say 

eliminating drug use, which in fact doesn’t happen—when we 

decide whether to criminalize drugs.

JOHN DONVAN 

I just, yes, right here.  Thank you, sir. 

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

I wonder if you look back on the history of drug abuse in this 

country, it feels not only an underground element, but it fuels 

other addictions—sexual addictions, it fuels the necessity, the 

necessity to try and buy drugs—regardless of what they cost.  

Because the ultimate problem with drugs is that they cost 

money.  And if you know, if we legalize ‘em, they are going to be 

more expensive than they are now, because the government will 

get involved in trying to…  Of course, we put a… 

JOHN DONVAN 

Sir, sir, how…?  Could…?

Yeah. 

JOHN DONVAN 

With respect to your question… 

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Well, what I want to say is… 

JOHN DONVAN 

…how would you relate it to our, to our discussion? 

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Well, what…  The question is…  Legalization of drugs is not going 

to change anything, and it’s not the reason for America’s blame 

on the Mexican drug problem, or the Mexican drug war.  Now 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 66. 

 

 

 

what I want to understand from you people is….how do you feel 

that the legalization is going to make, all of a sudden, everything 

great?  And no one is going to do drugs, and no one is going to 

create crimes, and nothing is going to happen that’s going to 

become more problems… 

JOHN DONVAN 

But you, I don’t think that’s what your point is here… 

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

Well, you… 

JOHN DONVAN 

Well, let’s take a hack at it. 

FAREED ZAKARIA 

You have a controlled experiment.  It is very rare in history to 

have a very simple, controlled experiment—which was the 

prohibition of alcohol.  And all these arguments were made—and 

that’s alcohol consumption did decline somewhat during 

Prohibition, but it produced a vast criminal enterprise.  It 

produced associated crimes in exactly the way you are 

describing.  And then, once it was decriminalized, most of it—the 

vast majority of it—went away.  So you know, nothing…  No 

analogy is perfect, but it’s very rare in history that you have 

actually, a case that’s about as close as you can get… 

 

It’s very important also to point out, I think, for people thinking 

about this.  There are many different ways you can decriminalize.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 67. 

 

 

 

You can decriminalize with, you know, medical use.  You can 

decriminalize with a very strong public health campaign, the way 

we have done with tobacco.  It can be even stronger in terms of 

the regulatory issues involved.  So it…  That you can 

decriminalize some and not others.  I do not agree that it is 

impossible to draw some lines.  Well, we draw lines all the time.  

Alcohol is, at some level, a drug, and we have decriminalized it.  

So it is possible to do this in many different ways.  We do have 

one historical example that’s pretty powerful. 

JOHN DONVAN 

OK.  Just a little bit of radio business.  We are in the question 

and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I

Mexico’s Drug War.”

because we have Chris Cox here, and that is, that is his purview 

and that…  Do I see a hand going up?  Yeah, yes, down in

Stand clear. 

ALAN BORSTEIN 

Yeah.  [LAUGHS] 

JOHN DONVAN 

Go ahead. 

ALAN BORSTEIN 

Well, birds, which I eat.  [LAUGHS]  And, um… 

I think the gun issue is a totally separate issue and maybe 

something for debate at some point as to how they should be 

controlled.  As far as the drug issue is concerned, I think that 

taxing it would be a great help.  And, I wonder if you think there 

are other ways to reduce consumption in the United States, 

besides the drug war and what… 

JOHN DONVAN 

All right, fair question.  Since…  And why don’t you take that, uh, 

Jeffrey? 

JEFFREY MIRON 

There are certainly possibilities for reducing use of any substance 

that we legalize, relative to what you would get otherwise.  

Minimum purchase ages might have some effect, although the 

evidence suggests they have relatively minor effects.  A tax is 

almost certainly the most effective way, because that 

unambiguously raises the price.  But there are clearly limits to 

what you can do with the tax, because if you make the tax high, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 69. 

 

 

 

try to make the price really high, you drive the market back 

underground.  So the accurate view is—you can adjust how 

much people consume somewhat, but you can’t fundamentally 

change the fact that people are going to use these substances. 

 

And whether you are getting the people you would like to 

discourage to stop using is much, much less clear.  In particular, 

by making it illegal, people who have no respect for the law are 

likely the ones who go ahead and consume it anyway.  The people 

who are likely the responsible users—the ones who might do it in 

moderation were it legal—are the ones who are deterred, so that’s 

exactly backwards under a policy of Prohibition. 

JOHN DONVAN 

There is a gentleman with a…waving a green card?  The mike is 

coming to you.

Thank you, good evening.  I have been an avid reader of Jorge

recommended agenda against President Calderón, he tried to 

change the terms of the debate tonight and put the blame on 

President Calderón.  To me, it is crazy for President Calderón to 

wage a war the way he is doing.  He is very courageous and I 

applaud him. 

 

And today, Jorge failed to present a side—just throwing punches

against the President of Mexico—for him to present an 

alternative.  He failed tonight.  He failed in his recent book.  I 

would like to hear something, a real proposal like this—without 

the comprehensive, comprehensive strategy against President 

Calderón.  Thank you. 

JOHN DONVAN 

Well, do you really want to take that, ‘cause I am…

[LAUGHS]  Yeah. 

JORGE CASTAÑEDA 

…and I have great respect for Ruben’s professional wisdom as a

JOHN DONVAN 

Yeah, yeah. 

JORGE CASTAÑEDA 

…if there was a little confusion there… 

JOHN DONVAN 

[LAUGHS]  Yeah. 

JORGE CASTAÑEDA 

OK.  I think there is an alternative, I think it is in the book.  And 

of course, in the one or two minutes of the seven I had for this, I 

did try to lay it out.  One of them has to do with not waging a war 

against all the cartels all the time, but concentrating on limiting 

collateral damage—that is, violence, kidnappings, corruption, 

etc.— without necessarily going after the drug trafficking itself, 

which is essentially what Uribe has done in Colombia.  And I go 

back to the issue:  There has been no reduction in coca leaf 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 72. 

 

 

 

acreage in Colombia over the past 10 years. 

 

Second, creating a national police force so that you don’t have to 

use the army.  Every time we use the army, we get into human 

rights violations, we get into corruption of the army.  This is a 

bad idea.  We haven’t created a national police force.  Zedillo 

didn’t do it;  Fox, when I was in government, didn’t do it;  and 

Calderón hasn’t done it.  And until we do that, it won’t work.  

And that’s another part of the alternative. 

JOHN DONVAN 

OK. 

JORGE CASTAÑEDA 

And the third part of the alternative is, once again, moving in the 

direction of decriminalization, so that we try and reduce the 

profits for that. 

 

And fourthly, yes, there is something to be done in truly sealing 

the border in Mexico—not at the southern border with 

Guatemala—but at the [UNCLEAR] , which requires much more 

cooperation from the United States to do.  What we’d be doing is 

just pushing the drugs out into the sea coming into the United 

States, but there is a good case to be made:  Drugs want to come 

to the United States because Americans want to keep consuming 

them.  What we in Mexico are interested, quite honestly, is that 

they don’t come through Mexico.

JOHN DONVAN 

Hmmm.  [LAUGHTER]  Andrés, do you want to be very brief? 

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

I just want to very briefly take issue with Jorge’s repeated 

insistence that this “war” started in December of 2006.  Yes, 

President Calderón ratcheted up the effort, but as we have been 

discussing here tonight, this problem in Mexico specifically—but 

in the broader regions, the region more generally—dates back 

many decades.  And even the year before Calderón took office in 

2005, if you had been living in [UNCLEAR], you would feel there 

was a helluva war going on.  So I just wanted to make that clear. 

JOHN DONVAN 

Is there…  Is there not a single woman in the audience who 

wants to ask a question here? 

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

[LAUGHS, LAUGHTER]

Thank you guys for being here, and it’s really great to have you 

on our campus.  But I just wanted to ask.  Would either side 

believe, does…?  Does either side believe that the international 

drug wars could have been prevented if Richard Nixon and 

America didn’t declare that war on drugs? 

JOHN DONVAN 

Asa Hutchinson. 

ASA HUTCHINSON 

Well, I really have problems with the language that Richard—that 

President Nixon used:  “War on Drugs.”  I think that’s very 

unfortunate, because one, it implies an end;  you like to have 

wars end;  and secondly, it implies too much violence in that 

name.  And so, I, as head of the DEA, resisted using that;  I like 

to use “the fight against illegal drugs.”  The fight for our families.  

You know, reducing, use agent addictions.  So I think that is very 

unfortunate. 

 

In terms of internationally, sure.  The United States provides 

leadership whether it’s in the area of democracy and freedom, or 

whether it’s in trade.  People do respond to the United States, so 

we have provided some leadership in terms of the fight against 

illegal drugs.  But the bottom line is:  Each of those decisions—

well, they would never do anything, just because the United 

States wants them to do it.  You look at the Netherlands, for 

example.  The Netherlands started down the path of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 75. 

 

 

 

decriminalization.  They are toughening it up a little bit.  They see 

some serious problems there.  And so every country is making 

decisions on their own.  But I would say, by and large, the 

consensus historically has been:  drugs are harmful.  Let’s keep 

‘em out of our families.  The best way to do that is to keep them 

illegal. 

JOHN DONVAN 

And that concludes Round 2 of our debate.  Here is where we are.  

We are about to hear closing statements from each debater.  They 

will be two minutes each, and it’s their last chance to change 

your minds.  After you hear them speak, you will vote for the final 

time on where you stand on the motion.  But to remind you of 

where you stood before the debate:  Before the debate, our 

motion being “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War,” 43 

percent of you were for the motion, 22 percent were against, and 

35 percent were undecided.  We’ll have you vote again in just a 

few minutes.  And we are a short time away from learning who is 

the winner of this debate. 

 

So Round 3:  closing statements.  And first to summarize his 

position against our motion “America is to Blame for Mexico’s 

Drug War,” Asa Hutchinson, former Congressman, DEA 

administrator, and Undersecretary for the Department of 

Homeland Security.

ASA HUTCHINSON 

Thank you.  And I am grateful for this chance to debate with my 

colleagues in respectful fashion.  If I have been rude, please 

forgive me.  It’s been a very healthy debate. 

 

I am a little bit startled by the push toward legalization because I 

don’t think that is particularly relevant toward the topic.  The 

topic being:  Is America to blame?  And quite frankly, if you 

would have asked the question, “Does America have some 

responsibility, in terms of their drug consumption, as to the 

challenges that Mexico faces,” I would have to agree with that.  

But I think that is totally different.  And that’s not your decision 

today.  It is:  “Is America to Blame?”  That implies that we are 

doing something wrong in our policy.  And I don’t believe that we 

are.   

 

And secondly, it implies that somehow we have made Mexico 

make these decisions.  And I do not believe that the affirmative 

side has taken that burden of proof.  They have not had any facts 

to support the proposition that somehow the United States has 

made Calderón—President Calderón—go after the drug cartels.  I 

think the history is clear from everyone’s statements, that 

Mexico—and rightfully so—stands tall among the sovereign 

nations of the world.  It was their congress that has said drugs 

are illegal in their country.  It is their culture that has resulted in 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

the society they have that—which there is according to President 

Calderón, a “culture of corruption” in that country—that they 

have to address. 

 

Historically though, you have to go back 25 and 30 years and 

these problems are systematic.  They are integral to the history of 

Mexico.  And the United States is not to blame for that.  America 

is not to blame for what is being phased in Mexico today.  They 

say it’s because we have a consumption problem.  That might be 

debate.  I think the evidence is that marijuana use has declined 

from the ‘90s from 9.1 percent to 6.8 percent. 

JOHN DONVAN 

Asa Hutchinson…

Our motion is:  “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.”  

And now summarizing his position for this motion, Fareed 

Zakaria, Editor of Newsweek International, and host of CNN’s 

Fareed Zakaria GPS. 

FAREED ZAKARIA 

Thank you all very much.  And I want to tell you an anecdote.  I 

was in Singapore about 15 years ago and the leader of Singapore, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 78. 

 

 

 

Lee Kuan Yew—a tough guy who runs a pretty tough shop—was 

coming under some pressure because he had very strict drug 

testing programs in Singapore.  And he explained the problem to 

me this way.  He said, “You see, you Americans look at things 

very differently than we do.  When you have a drug problem, you 

look around and say, ‘Well, where are the drugs coming from?  

Panama.  Let’s go in and invade Panama, arrest the president, 

put him in jail, and that’s how we’ll solve the drug problem.’ ”  He 

said, “I don’t have that option in Singapore.  I have got to actually 

deal with the problem I have in my society.  And for that reason, I 

am going to have intrusive drug testing.” 

 

I raise this to make two points.  One, you don’t have to believe in 

decriminalization to believe that we are exporting this problem 

and have been exporting the war and the criminalization from the 

Caribbean through Colombia, and now into Mexico.  But the 

more important point I want to make—and I urge you…  You 

know, it’s often you could look at these things as games.  It is 

very important that America own up to its responsibilities.  That 

we not push the blame on one more poor country, on one more 

neighbor.  That we recognize that we do have something to do 

with what is going on.  This is a disease in American foreign 

policy, it is a disease in American society.  And it is very 

important that you and the vote you make—and we as a society—

own up to it.

There is this wonderful quote from Fitzgerald’s Gatsby that I 

always remember about Tom and Daisy Buchanan.  He says of 

them—as typical Americans—he says, “They were careless 

people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures 

and then retreated back into their money or their vast 

carelessness.”  Let’s not be like that.  Let’s take responsibility.  

[APPLAUSE] 

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Fareed Zakaria. 

 

“America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” is our motion.  And 

summarizing his position against that motion, Chris Cox, Chief 

Lobbyist for the National Rifle Association. 

CHRIS COX 

Thank you.  What’s clearly not to blame is America’s Second 

Amendment or the lack of some law [LAUGHTER] to outlaw 

what’s already illegal on both sides of the border.  To even 

suggest that this criminal enterprise has anything to do with our 

rights is absurd.  It’s preposterous. 

 

So let me be clear where we come from.  Do we support the 

current administration’s proclaimed conviction to hunt down and 

root out the drug cartels?  Absolutely.  Do we feel for the poor 

Mexican people who are being terrorized by narco terrorists?

They are abandoned by their own officials.  They are left 

defenseless by their own, their own government?  Of course we 

do, passionately.  But we are going to give up our Second 

Amendment rights on some empty promise that’s going to—this 

is going to make the Mexican people safer?  Not now, and not 

ever.  Our rights don’t endanger anyone—and they make this 

country freer, safer, and a lot more stable than other countries 

around the world, including Mexico. 

 

American law enforcement can work with the Mexican 

government, should work and does work with the Mexican law 

enforcement to bring people to justice who break the law.  

Collectively, we have the tools, we have the intelligence, we have 

the manpower, but what we apparently lack is the guts—that 

straight and high integrity to tell each other the truth on all these 

issues.  Until we get to that point, until we can look each other in 

the eye and tell the truth and be honest, this whole question is 

irrelevant.  Thank you. 

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Chris Cox.  [APPLAUSE] 

 

Summarizing for our motion, “America is to Blame for Mexico’s 

Drug War,” Jeffrey Miron, a senior lecturer and Director of 

Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Economics at 

Harvard.

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 81. 

 

 

 

JEFFREY MIRON 

Again, thank you very much for being here and for listening.  Let 

me start by conceding some elements of merit in my opponents’ 

points.  First, I think Mr. Cox is absolutely right, U.S. gun policy 

has nothing to do with the issue.  There would be just as much of 

a drug war, just as much violence, if we banished U.S. guns;  the 

guns would come from somewhere else. 

 

I think Mr. Hutchinson has a fair point.  Countries are meant to 

be sovereign.  Mexico could, in principle, say “We don’t care what 

U.S. policy is.  We don’t care about NAFTA.  We don’t care how 

much the U.S. is harassing us.  We are going to legalize drugs,” 

or “We are going to de-escalate our own drug wars, because 

that’s a sensible thing to do.”  In principle, could they do that on 

their own?  Yes.  Would they come under enormous international 

pressure and U.S. pressure?  Absolutely.  So I think he is 

painting much, much too optimistic a case. 

 

I think that Jorge Castañeda has a very valid point.  Certainly, 

the situation got much worse when Calderón escalated, OK?  And 

the degree to which you try to enforce a “drug war” plays a huge 

role in how bad it is.  Many European countries have laws which 

are not so different than the U.S. laws, but they basically do 

almost nothing to try to enforce them.  They leave the cartels, 

they leave the suppliers basically alone, and they don’t get nearly 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 82. 

 

 

 

the magnitude of the violence and other negative side effects.  So 

there is certainly a valid point there as well. 

 

I would also note, I think, that four of the six of us here could 

agree that we would have liked the question to have been, 

“Should the U.S. and Mexico de-escalate their war on drugs,” 

OK?  And I think the three of us here—along with Jorge—would 

all agree with…in the affirmative for that.  So perhaps we can 

have another discussion on that point. 

 

But at the end of the day, the fact is that the U.S.—throughout 

the last 90 years—has done everything in its power to push its 

Puritanical, Prohibitionist message and policy on the rest of the 

world, Mexico being very much at the forefront, and going back 

well before Felipe Calderón.  So yes, America is to blame for the 

for the drug wars in Mexico. 

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Jeffrey Miron.  [APPLAUSE] 

 

Summarizing against our motion, Jorge Castañeda, former 

Foreign Minister of Mexico, and here at New York University, 

Professor of Political Silence—sorry, Political…  [LAUGHTER]  

Oh…  [APPLAUSE] 

JORGE CASTAÑEDA 

As my students can testify… 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 83. 

 

 

 

JOHN DONVAN 

Yes, yeah.  [LAUGHTER]  Well, let me finish, let me finish my 

windup for you, without the Freudian slip.  [LAUGHTER]  Jorge 

Castañeda, former Foreign Minister of Mexico, and Professor of 

Political Science and Latin American Studies at New York 

University. 

JORGE CASTAÑEDA 

I am very glad to hear at this point that, yes, at least four of us—

and I am not so sure, well, perhaps, well, the rest of my members 

of my team would disagree entirely that the way this war has 

been declared, waged and is being fought, perhaps was not the 

most intelligent idea and that perhaps a series of modifications 

should be made. 

 

But in any case, on the fundamental issue.  I think that if we 

accept the premise that the United States is to blame for the 

war—which I do not, because as I said, I think this is President 

Calderón’s war, and it did begin now.  The previous six 

presidents of Mexico have contained with more or less 

corruption, more or less violence, more or less intelligence, the 

cartels, but did not declare this generalized war on them.  The 

first time that has happened is now. 

 

The question is:  Is there any change in the United States’ 

situation…in the last two or three years…that has had a direct 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 84. 

 

 

 

impact on Mexican production, violence, corruption, etc.?  And 

there is no evidence of that.  I would just respectfully disagree 

with my colleague Asa on the question of U.S. demand.  Fareed 

brought it up, and he is right.  I don’t know what “demand” has 

been, but I do know—from DEA figures—that the price of drugs 

in the United States over the last 40 years has tended to decrease 

for all drugs.  Now, it may be that some “demand” has dropped 

and prices have also dropped, but that is hard to argue directly.  

My sense is that, overall, demand has been more or less stable 

for all drugs, except for changes within them. 

 

And on the gun question, I also think that there is no significant 

change.  It’s not that all of a sudden there are more guns going to 

Mexico.  There are a lot though.  Fareed, I would tend to disagree 

with “the 2,000 per day,” that’s 700,000 per year.  That would be 

two million, just in the past three years.  The numbers don’t add 

up.  And by the way, there are three million registered guns in 

Mexico, including those of the government.  There are more than 

two and a half billion registered, legal gun owners in Mexico 

today. 

JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Jorge Castañeda.  [APPLAUSE] 

 

And finally, with our motion, “America is to Blame for Mexico’s 

Drug War,” summarizing for the motion, Andrés Martinez, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 85. 

 

 

 

Director of the New America Foundation, Bernard L. Schwartz 

Fellows Program, and a former editor at the L.A. Times. 

ANDRÉS MARTINEZ 

Thank you.  And again, I want to reiterate my appreciation for 

your being here and for the Rosenkranz Foundation for hosting 

this important forum. 

 

First off, I just quickly wanted to take issue again with Jorge on 

this question of whether the drug  war started under President 

Calderón.  And yes, there was a “surge,” if you will—or a “frontal 

declaration against all cartels, all the time,” as you put it.  But I 

think the alternative…  It’s very cynical to say, “Well, the 

government should have continued accommodating with these 

cartels.”  And clearly, this day of reckoning was in the offing 

when— sooner or later. 

 

But I think, again, America is to blame for the violence, for the 

war.  Asa Hutchinson said, “We offered no facts, we offered no 

evidence.”  I just point you again to a 65 billion dollar 

consumption demand for this, these illicit drugs in this country.  

I think the fact that we have spent so much time talking about 

whether or not to legalize is indicative—and again, I am agnostic 

on that question—but I think it’s indicative that we all 

understand that the root cause here is the fact that we have this 

massive market in this country for a product that we have also 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 86. 

 

 

 

made illegal.  65 billion dollars is more than 5 percent of Mexico’s 

GDP.  According to Jorge’s fantastic book, Mexico has a 

consumption—illicit drug consumption rates—that are below 

international averages.  Only 5 percent of Mexicans have ever 

tried illegal drugs, compared to 42 percent of Americans.  When I 

was a kid, they used to make stamps, “Mexico Exporta,” stamps 

of export products.  They could have…might as well made illicit 

drugs.  This is all about supply and demand.  It’s all about 

supplying the American market.  90 percent of the cocaine that is 

consumed in this country now goes through Mexico, because of 

some of the shifts that Fareed mentioned earlier. 

 

We have to accept that our actions have consequences.  We can’t 

constantly outsource the repercussions of our hypocrisy.  Please 

accept responsibility and vote with us that America is to blame 

for Mexico’s drug war. 

JOHN DONVAN 

And that concludes our closing statements.  [APPLAUSE] 

 

And now it is time to learn which side argued best.  You are going 

to choose our winner.  Once again, going to the keypads near 

your seat.  You voted before the debate.  Your position on our 

motion, “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.”  We would 

like to ask you to vote once again on this position, having heard 

the arguments.  Press number 1 if you support the motion, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 87. 

 

 

 

number 2 if you are against, and number 3 if you remain or 

became undecided.  The motion, “America is to Blame for 

Mexico’s Drug War.” 

 

And it looks like everyone is done.  We are going to have the 

results probably in about 90 seconds.  In the meantime, I want to 

tell you what’s coming up in our next season.  First of all, I want 

to thank all of you in the audience and our panel for a compelling 

discussion and for [APPLAUSE] arguing honestly, fairly and good 

naturedly. 

 

So this is our last debate of 2009.  And looking forward to 2010, 

here is what we are going to be debating at this point in our 

spring series.  On January 19th, our motion is “California is the 

first failed state.”  It will feature former Governor Gray Davis and 

Van Jones, who recently left his post as White House 

environmental advisor. 

 

On February 9th, the motion is “The U.S. should step back from 

its special relationship with Israel.”  We are going to have New 

York Times columnist Roger Cohen and Columbia University 

pressure—or professor Rashid Khalidi, and Israel’s former 

Ambassador to the United States, Itamar Rabinovitz. 

 

On March 16th, the motion is “Don’t blame teachers unions for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.” 

 “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” (12/1/09) Page 88. 

 

 

 

our failing schools.”  We’ll have former Education Secretary Rod 

Paige. 

 

April 13th, “Organic food is marketing hype.”  We’ll have Blue Hill 

chef Dan Barber, and Vogue food writer Jeffrey Steingarten. 

 

Finally, on May 11th, the motion will be “Give every U.S. 

educated Ph.D. a Green Card.”  We’ll have Intel’s Craig Barrett as 

part of that panel. 

 

Individual tickets and packages are now available by visiting our 

Web site, and at the Skirball box office.  And make sure to 

become a fan of Intelligence Squared U.S. on Facebook, and you 

will receive discount on next season’s debates. 

 

And finally, a special thank you to NPR and to Bloomberg 

Television for distributing the IQ2 debates this season, and to our 

media partner Newsweek magazine.  Don’t forget to pick up a 

copy on your way out. 

 

And now it is in.  You have voted twice.  And I have just been 

given the results.  Remember, the side that changes the most 

minds here will be declared our winner.  Our motion has been, 

“America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.”  Before the debate, 

43 percent of you were for the motion, 22 percent of you were

against, and 35 percent were undecided.  After the debate, 72 

percent of you are for the motion, 22 percent remain against, and 

6 percent [LAUGHTER] undecided.  [APPLAUSE]  The side for the 

motion wins.  Congratulations to that side.  And thank you from 

me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S.
