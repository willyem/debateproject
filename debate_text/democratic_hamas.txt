ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 
Well thank you very, very much Judy and good evening to all of 

you.  I'm here with Dana Wolfe, the executive producer of this 

debate series and we'd like to welcome each of you to this third 

debate of our fall season.  We want to encourage each of, each 

side of tonight's argument to listen to the proposing views and 

respond to inconvenient facts.  I hope you the audience come 

away with the recognition that there's an intellectually 

respectable argument on both sides.  And I want to thank once 

again WNYC and NPR for producing and airing these debates on 

public radio and to The Times of London for their sponsorship.  I 

want to especially thank our moderator this evening, veteran 

broadcast journalist Judy Woodruff.  And the extraordinary group 

of panelists who are the true stars of tonight's evening.  This 

evening's debate is extraordinarily timely.  Just this week, Prime 

Minister Ohmert took a conciliatory stance, offering Palestinians a 

series of incentives to build on a shaky cease fire in Gaza.  It was 

also reported that Hamas lost control at a key Palestinian 

university, perhaps reflecting the shift in thinking of educated 

youth, cognizant of the economic costs of its continued violent

rhetoric.  In presenting tonight's debate, we're hopeful that the 

rapidly shifting events of the day can be seen in a broader context 

and a more historical and strategic one.  In particular the debate 

promises to highlight the interplay of two ideas that both have 

deep appeal.  The first is that the more democracy we have in the 

world, the better and safer the world will be.  Our commitment to 

this idea cuts across a partisan divide.  Ever since Woodrow 

Wilson, there's been a strong current in American foreign policy 

to promote a world order based on moral principles that we 

believe in.  A current which liberal human rights activists and 

conservative democracy advocates both embody.  The second idea 

is that the more terrorism succeeds as a weapon to achieve 

geopolitical objectives, the more dangerous our world becomes.  

Success emboldens terrorist groups, enhances their status as 

they jockey for power.  Well the tension between these ideas 

comes into sharp focus if a terrorist group prevails in a 

democratic election.  In principle, how should we interact with 

such a government?  And what about Hamas in particular?  Once 

in power, are Hamas leaders forced by global and local realities 

into a pragmatic stance?  Should we listen to their rhetoric 

differently – as the familiar efforts of politicians to shore up their 

base, by speaking to the most extreme of their supporters.  Which 

way does the evidence point?  These kinds of questions, more 

than the semantics of the proposition itself, should determine 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 3. 

 
 
 

how we vote on tonight's motion.  I'm now gonna hand the 

evening over to our moderator, Judy Woodruff, who has covered 

politics and other news for more than three decades, at CNN, 

NBC and PBS.  This year she has been conducting a series of 

reports for PBS on the views of young Americans.  Thank you 

Judy.  Enjoy the debate.  [APPLAUSE]   

JUDY WOODRUFF 
Thank you Bob very much for that introduction.  And I am 

delighted to be here.  I want to welcome all of you in the audience 

here in New York City, to the third Intelligence Squared US 

debate.  I agree with what Bob Rosenkranz just said.  We need 

more civilized discussions of important, even critical topics like 

the one we're gonna be hearing about tonight.  I'm gonna give you 

just a brief rundown of this evening.  First, we are gonna have the 

proposer of the motion begin by presenting his side of the 

argument.  The opposition will follow.  Each person will get a 

maximum of eight minutes and we will go back and forth from 

one side to the other.  Second, when all six speakers have 

finished with their opening remarks I'm gonna be opening up the 

floor for brief questions from you in the audience.  Third, when 

the question period from the audience is complete, each of the 

debaters will make a final statement that will last not more than 

two minutes each.  And fourth, during those closing statements, 

ballot boxes are gonna be passed around the auditorium for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 4. 

 
 
 

voting.  These are the tickets that you have, you should have in 

your hands.  You will put in either the for piece, it's green or the 

against piece, it's red. You'll tear it off.  Tear it off, rip it off and 

put it in, whichever side you are for.  Or the whole ticket if you 

still don't know which side you favor. If anyone does not have a 

ticket ballot an usher will get you one at an appropriate moment.  

Fifth and last, after the final closing statements have been made, 

I will announce the results of the audience vote and we will know 

then which side has carried the day.  We are fortunate tonight to 

have a very distinguished panel to be our debaters and I'm going 

to introduce them now.  For the motion, former foreign policy 

advisor to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and until earlier this 

month, Israel's ambassador to the United States, Daniel Ayalon.  

[APPLAUSE].  An expert on Arab politics and US Middle East 

policy from the Council on Foreign Relations, Steven A. Cook.  

[APPLAUSE] Author, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and 

editor-at-large of National Review, John O'Sullivan.  [APPLAUSE] 

And now against the motion.  Lawyer and advocate for Muslim 

and Palestinian advocates, Stanley L. Cohen.  [APPLAUSE] 

Associate Director of the Harvard program on humanitarian 

policy and conflict research, Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou.  

[APPLAUSE]  And journalist, author and co-director of the UK/DC 

based conflicts forum, Mark Perry.  [APPLAUSE]  And now we will 

begin the debate and to present the question once again, a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 5. 

 
 
 

democratically elected Hamas is still a terrorist organization.  We 

are gonna call on each person to step up to the podium.  I'm 

gonna call on them.  And we are gonna begin with Steven A. 

Cook.  For.   

STEVEN A. COOK 
Thank you very much for being here this evening.  I'd like to 

thank first of all IQ2 and the Rosenkranz Foundation.  And 

looking out at the audience today it's truly extraordinary what a 

diverse group we have.  Uh people in the audience who wouldn't 

normally sit together to discuss such difficult and emotion – and 

often emotional issues.  Um I'd also like to thank Judy Woodruff 

for uh being here to uh to moderate this debate.  And I'd also like 

to thank my fellow debaters.  Uh I am very much looking forward 

to this evening's intellectual combat.  The subject of this evening's 

debate is in one sense rather puzzling.  Despite electoral success, 

Hamas is still a terrorist organization.  What is there really to 

debate here?  What does participation in an election have to do 

with Hamas' profile as a terrorist organization?   I am quite sure 

that my colleagues on the other side of the debate will tell you 

that the Palestinian elections were the truest, freest and fairest in 

the Arab world.  That's an absolutely true statement.  They're also 

going to tell you that the outcome  reflected the will of the 

Palestinian people.  That's an absolutely false statement.  And 

three, they're gonna tell you that Hamas provides critical social 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 6. 

 
 
 

services to Palestinians in need.  That is, my friends, totally 

irrelevant to tonight's subject.  These arguments amount to little 

more than an analytical slight of hand.  An organization can 

participate in a free and fair election.  It can provide social 

services and be a terrorist organization.   There is no seriously 

scholarly work out there that indicates that any of these activities 

are mutually exclusive.  Despite what Bob Rosenkranz said in his 

eloquent remarks to open this evening's events, it is not an 

intellectual position to suggest that Hamas is no longer a terrorist 

organization.  It's an ideological position. It's ideological.  Rather 

than an analytical conclusion based on the available evidence, 

let's consider a few things.  I'll leave it to my colleagues to 

describe for you the number of innocents who have been killed at 

the hands of Hamas.  But it's important to provide some 

historical context here.  To the evolution of Hamas.  Hamas' very 

founding in the late 1980's was based on an imperative of 

violence. In the late 1980's, members of the Palestine branch of 

the Muslim Brotherhood grew concerned that another 

organization called Islamic Jihad was taking prestige and 

influence away from them because Islamic Jihad was engaged in 

violence.  Their solution to this political problem was the 

establishment of Hamas.  They would continue the Islamization of 

Palestinian society from below through the provision of social 

services, in keeping with the historic mission of the Muslim 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 7. 

 
 
 

Brotherhood.  But they also established a military wing.  A 

military wing that was dedicated to terrorist acts against Israelis 

in an effort to burnish their nationalist image and out-maneuver 

Islamic Jihad.  The founding covenant of Hamas which has not 

changed is explicit in its mission to elaborate all of historical 

Palestine through a variety of tactics including violence.  The 

result has been the bloody carnage of the streets of Tel Aviv, 

Jerusalem, Ashkelon and numerous other Israeli cities.  My 

critics will say this is old news.  Hamas has evolved. It's become a 

political organization.  This as Mahmoud Mohamedou said is a 

historic opportunity.  But my question is has Hamas really 

evolved?  It still denies Israel's right to exist.  None of its leaders 

have renounced the right to armed struggle.  The only thing has 

changed is a tactical change.  It has sought to harness the 

elections that the United States has pushed on the Palestinians to 

advance its agenda.  And what is that agenda?  The 

establishment of a Palestinian state in all of historic Palestine 

with sharia Islamic law at its core.  Well what about a cease fire?  

My critics will tell you there's been a cease fire since 2003.  Be 

careful about the words that people use when talking about a 

cease fire.  Hamas calls it a hudna.  My colleague Mahmoud 

Mohamedou calls it tahdiya.  Well in fact both of those, both of 

those have a temporary quality to them.  Anyone who speaks 

Arabic should know that a hudna has a finite period of time.  It's 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 8. 

 
 
 

not much of a cease fire anyway.  Since the Israelis withdrew 

from the Gaza Strip they've been victim of rocket assaults on their 

towns, the kidnapping of their soldiers and threats to their major 

cities.  Under the weight of available evidence and I have a little 

bit of uh a little bit of this just before.  Stanley and I were 

standing around before, talking about what we did agree on.  The 

Giants, the Yankees, the Knicks and the desultory state of our 

teams.  And then we got into talking about Hamas and I said 

sure, they wouldn't be a terrorist organization, they just have to 

lay down their arms.  And he said you're right the Israelis have to 

lay down their arms.  That's not the point.  It's cute, it's funny 

but it's not the point.  Under the weight of available evidence, 

supporters of Hamas tend to shift their argument to focus on 

Israeli behavior.  And I should point out a case in point was Judy 

Woodruff's extraordinary interview with former President Carter 

last night on the “NewsHour.”  It is true, Israel has expropriated 

land and continues to illegally settle the West Bank.  Israel has 

killed Palestinian civilians.  Though unlike Hamas not 

intentionally.  It has worked assiduously to undermine Mahmoud 

Abbas and before him Yasser Arafat.  All this is very, very true.  

But it neither alters the fact that Hamas is a terrorist 

organization.  Nor absolves Hamas of the bloody responsibility for 

its own behavior.  If the issue was Israel's contributed to an 

environment where extremist ideologies, alienation and terrorism 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 9. 

 
 
 

can thrive, there would be little to debate.  But this is not the 

subject we're examining here this evening.  Participation in 

elections – Hamas' participation in the Palestinian elections is 

analytically irrelevant of whether it is a terrorist organization or 

not.  It is a group that remains dedicated to Israel's destruction 

and in the process of that destruction, the inevitable killing of 

innocents.  For Hamas to no longer be considered a terrorist 

organization it must change its charter.  It must renounce its 

violence and it must lay down its arms.  At that point and only at 

that point can it be seen as a legitimate participant in the political 

arena.  With that I urge you, I urge you to vote with the 

proposition that a democratically elected Hamas is and remains a 

terrorist organization.  Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]    

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Against the proposition, Stanley L. Cohen.   

STANLEY L. COHEN 
I would like to thank everyone for the invitation for tonight.  To 

repeat this is a wonderful event.  It's much needed in this city.  I 

find myself sort of changing what I wanted to say as I was sitting 

here and listening to my adversary.  I come from a different 

perspective.  Interestingly enough, I’ve just returned from 

Damascus where I happened to be meeting with the leadership of 

Hamas.  And I and I bring that to your attention because when I 

said I was coming to a debate in New York City over whether 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 10. 

 
 
 

you're a terrorist organization or not, the leadership said you 

Westerners you spend all your time debating how many angels 

are on the head of a pin and history marches on.  And that's not 

to denigrate or the significance of this debate, this discussion 

tonight.  But to keep in its perspective that while we debate, while 

we argue, while we disagree, there is death and destruction on 

the ground.  And while my adversary trivializes the injury to 

Palestinians, I'd like to sort of begin by really honing in on what 

we're talking about tonight.  Since the year 2000, 4,800 

Palestinians, mostly civilians killed.  839 children under ten.  755 

women.  31,750 injured.  800 permanently disabled.  241 extra-

judicial assassinations.  11,000 Palestinians including 380 under 

the age of sixteen and 240 women sitting in jails, most of whom 

who have never had a trial, have never seen a judge and do not 

have counsel.  4,800 homes demolished.  4,200 businesses 

destroyed.  Thousands of hectares of oil groves razed.  In the last 

five months, while unfortunately Israel has lost ten civilians, 557 

Palestinians of whom 420 were civilians including 116 women 

and thirty three children were killed by the Israeli defense forces.  

Now collective punishment it's not the exception.  Attacks on the 

infrastructure, the disruption of water plants, the destruction of 

electricity.  Unemployment.  Infant mortality rates.  Disease.  

Malnutrition.  These are not issues for abstract debate.  These are 

harsh realities for Palestinians.  Who did this?  Hamas didn't do 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 11. 

 
 
 

this, Israel did this.  And it's not new.  Think back to the British.  

The Stern gang, Menachem Begin, a Prime Minister of Israel, a 

terrorist.  The King David and [INAUDIBLE] hotels blown up.  The 

UN mediator assassinated by the Stern gang.  Ethnic cleansings 

with 800,000 Palestinians driven from their homers.  400 villages 

erased from the map.  So this is not some sort of esoteric debate 

with the West.  This is reality. This is truth and this is sixty 

years.  An unbroken trail of terrorism, not at the hands of 

Hamas.  But at the hands of Israel.  Dar Yassin, Sabra and 

Shatila, I love the notion about how Israel always unlike Hamas, 

accidentally kills.  Bethanune last week, nineteen women and 

children sitting in a house, an errant tank shell.  Of course the 

apologies, of course Israel says oops well sorry.  We'll have an 

investigation and on it goes.  And what of international law?  The 

Geneva conventions that prohibit systematic torture.  The Israeli 

Supreme Court eventually put an end to it.  The occupied lands 

in violation of Israeli law and Geneva conventions.  It goes on and 

on.  321 condemnations by the United – United Nations Generally 

– General Assembly ignored.  Ninety one condemnations by the 

Security Council ignored.  There is a double standard.  And that's 

what's interesting and I mean no disrespect to the debate tonight.  

As a trial attorney sometimes I say to a witness so when did you 

stop beating your wife?  And the witness looks at you like what 

are you talking about?  And that's the problem with the debate.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 12. 

 
 
 

It starts out with a pre-conceived notion that Hamas is a terrorist 

organization.  To much of the world, Hamas is not viewed as a 

terrorist organization but rather a national liberation movement 

involved in low intensity, asymmetric warfare.  To much of the 

world or many in the world community, Israel is viewed as a 

terrorist state.  The problem is civilians are always caught in 

between.  I don't apologize for any civilian getting killed anywhere 

but I don't make light of it as if they're just fodder for the Israeli 

machine.  We know in this country we're used to civilian 

causalities.  Sherman's march on Atlanta.  The fire bombings in 

Dresden.  It goes on.  If you're a North American Indian you're a 

little bit familiar with terrorism in this particular context.  And 

Israel in the war this summer, a million cluster bombs and anti-

personnel mines.  There is a fine line between terrorism and 

freedom fighter unfortunately.  And it is who wins.  Every person 

in the world dies to have a picture taken with Nelson Mandela.  

Who stayed in jail an extra eight years because he refused to 

renounce armed struggle.  Malcolm X, an American by any means 

necessary.  Now he's on postage stamps.  So we have to be careful 

about evolving notions of terrorism.  We have to be careful about 

language and what we suggest to the community.  Who is 

Hamas?  Hamas is not just a military wing.  It's just kids 

strapping explosives on themselves.  They're doctors and lawyers 

and professors and scientists and academics who have given their 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 13. 

 
 
 

life to try to get, to try to reclaim what has been stolen from them.  

Now you can trivialize the election but most important remember 

Hamas is millions of people who voted and many of them with a 

bigger plurality than George Bush ever appreciated in his two 

terms, voted for Hamas.  Now there's a double standard. The 

West, including Israel loves Abu Masen.  And why do they love 

him?  Well because he speaks Western.  He talks Western.  He 

walks the walk.  He looks good.  He's a good Palestinian leader.  

What's interesting is he's not considered a terrorist even though 

he's a figure head of Fatah  which has an armed movement called 

al-Aqsa.  They do bombings but he's OK.  Hamas is not. Now 

what do we know that's happened since the election? Collective 

punishment.  Leaders kidnapped.  Cabinet members kidnapped.  

An attempt to destabilize and topple a legitimate elected 

government.  Economic embargoes and strangulation.    

JUDY WOODRUFF  
One –  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Providing arms to the other side.  The bottom line here is Hamas 

is the only group that can deliver.  Let us find a way to break out 

of this cycle.  To break out of this abyss.  To forget about labels.  

Labels mean nothing.  The only group that can deliver is Hamas, 

and you know what – if they can't, they'll be voted out.  And at 

the end of the day it's time to end the embargo, it's time to empty 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 14. 

 
 
 

the jails, it's time to stop the attempt to topple a government.  But 

most of all forget the labels and forget the rhetoric.  For sixty 

years it has not worked.  Give the alternative a chance.  Thank 

you.  [APPLAUSE]   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Thank you and now for the proposition, John O'Sullivan.   

JOHN O'SULLIVAN 
Madam Chairperson, ladies and gentlemen.  Uh well thank you 

for that kind introduction before Ms. Woodruff.  And um and I 

want to share in the general uh agreement of the panel here that 

we're grateful for the organizers of this event of which there ought 

to be many more.  Uh in order to stimulate genuinely interesting 

debate. I um I will begin by going straight to the topic.  Because 

anyone who deals with terrorism has to be begin, and I was asked 

to do this by the last speaker, with its definition.  I think  you 

must also scotch the old canard that one man's terrorist is 

another man's freedom fighter.  My own definition has the 

distinction of having been adopted by the Court of Appeals in 

Canada.  If I may quote, Mister Justice Neland, quoting me in the 

case of Canada versus Najoub in October, 2001, the court spoke 

as follows – a terrorist is a man who murders indiscriminately, 

distinguishing neither between civilian and innocent and guilty 

nor soldier and civilian.  He may employ terrorism – planting 

bombs in restaurants, hijacking planes, in a bad cause or a good 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 15. 

 
 
 

one.  He may be a Nazi terrorist or an anti-Nazi terrorist.  A 

Communist or an anti-Communist.  Pro Palestinian or pro-Israel.  

We may want to defeat his political cause or to see it triumph.  

For his methods however a terrorist is always to be condemned.  

Indeed to describe him objectively is to condemn him.  Even if his 

cause is genuinely a fight for freedom with which we sympathize.  

Unquote, unquote.  [LAUGHTER] Now we are asked today to 

consider whether organizations that use terrorist methods as 

describe above should also be admitted into the arena of 

conventional politics and in particular to the arena of 

conventional democratic politics.  The motion cites Hamas.  But 

Hamas is not the only organization that combines seeking power 

through elections with terrorism.  Hezbollah does the same.  So 

does the Eta linked Batasuna party in the Basque region of 

Spain.  So does the two headed Sinn Fein IRA in Northern 

Ireland.  Nor are these organizations shy about their deeds.  They 

openly boast of employing terrorism even if they sometimes 

quibble at the word.  Sinn Fein for example has said clearly that 

it sought power through the Armalite rifle and the ballot box.  

These four parties I’ve mentioned have enjoyed varying degrees of 

success.  They all raise the same question.  If a democratically 

elected group employs terrorist methods, should it be regarded as 

having run itself out democratic politics and should we refuse, 

refuse to deal with it.  Ideally I maintain that they should be run 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 16. 

 
 
 

out of politics and that we should refuse to deal with them.  

Indeed I would go further.  When we deal with such bodies, as if 

they are conventional parties, we are making murder respectable.  

We are in fact inciting people to murder.  First because we are 

saying that murder is no bar to participation in high politics.   

And when we treat with terrorist parties supported by small 

numbers of voters as is true of the Basque party and it used to be 

true of Sinn Fein, we are inciting murder a second time.  Because 

we have admitted, we are negotiating with them because they 

murder people and not for any other reason.  When you incite 

murder you get more murders.  Inciting terrorism has similarly 

produced a spreading stain of terrorism since the hijackings of 

Dawson Field in 1970.  Let me make a first qualification for this 

bold statement of principle.  If the price of halting a murderous 

insurgency is to admit the former terrorists into democratic 

politics that may sometimes be a price worth paying to save lives 

and establish a decent political order.  But it is a price.  The 

terrorists moreover must be former.  They must have abandoned 

terrorism finally, completely and publicly.  They cannot be 

mysteriously linked to terrorists still or leaving terrorism in a 

gradual way.  They must be exclusively committed to democratic 

politics and willing to accept its verdicts even when those verdicts 

are unfavorable to them.  I don't like making that concession.  It 

means that crimes go unpunished, injustice is entrenched and 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 17. 

 
 
 

the moral [INAUDIBLE] of democracy is tainted. Note though that 

is a very limited concession.  While we may have to deal with 

former terrorists in official transactions of normal business, we 

should show them no signs of approval or respect.  Even if they 

hold high government positions, they must be given no state 

visits, no honorary knighthood, no White House dinners.  Until 

they have purged their guilt in some way, they must always feel 

the mark of Cane is on their brow.  But the distinguished 

advocates tonight, opposite, are proposing something far more 

dramatic than easing former thugs out of terrorism and into 

official limousines.  They suggest that we should treat as good 

faith democrats those who are still engaged in organizing suicide 

bombings and still planning rocket attacks.  Their election it 

seems somehow validates their terror methods or at least their 

terror methods do not invalidate their election.  Now here's my 

second qualification.  We are going to reach somewhat different 

conclusions, depending on whether we are citizens of a country in 

which there is a terrorist group engaged in democratic politics.  

For example, if we're a Lebanese democrat in a state which has 

Hezbollah as a political party.  Or depending on whether we are 

citizens of a state that is the um that is the neighbor of a country 

which has a terrorist government.  For example the citizen of 

Israel next door to a government that includes um Hamas.  Uh 

take the first case.  The citizen of the state in which there is a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 18. 

 
 
 

terrorist party.  Uh engaged in normal politics.  That means that 

one party in politics has got its own private army and the others 

do not.  It can intimidate the other parties.  It can overturn 

election results, it can ignore political defeats.  Uh it is not in a 

sense a normal political party at all.  And its very existence is a 

contradiction of the concept of democracy that most of us would 

recognize.  What happens in such cases?  Well let us take the 

most favorable case for the other side, that of the Northern 

Ireland peace process which most people think has been a good 

thing.  For the first eight years of this process [OVERLAPPING 

VOICES]   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
One –  

JOHN O'SULLIVAN 
OK.  I'm afraid I'm gonna skip to the, to the other point.  Different 

principles apply when we're talking about relations between 

states.  If a state is at war with another, whether or not the 

enemy government is democratic is a very secondary 

consideration.  What matters is the disposition of that state's 

foreign policy.   Does the other state have a serious interest in 

making peace?  If it makes peace will it keep its word?  Does it 

have long term aims compatible with a stable peace?  Are its 

internal dynamics such that the government offering to negotiate 

peace is likely to survive.  On strictly practical grounds, it is hard 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 19. 

 
 
 

to imagine a prudent citizen answering those questions positively 

if the other government is composed of terrorists or routed in a 

terrorist party.  The terrorists have a serious interest in making 

peace – will they keep their word, are they trustworthy?  Do they 

generally have political aims compatible with a stable peace?  We 

should probably answer all those questions no.  And if the 

terrorist government is democratically elected [OVERLAPPING 

VOICES]   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Time's up.   

JOHN O'SULLIVAN 
The prognosis might be worse rather than better.  After all if an 

electorate has voluntarily elected a terrorist party, it's internal 

dynamics are unlikely to be favorable to peace making and 

political stability.  So for that reason it doesn’t really matter 

whether or not Hamas is democratically elected.  What matters is 

whether or not it carries on its terrorist methods.  [APPLAUSE]   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
And now against the proposition, Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou.   

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
Thank you very much Ms. Woodruff.  You can add my voice to 

that of my colleagues to thank you and the organizers as well as 

the audience for this.  Um it's a wonderful opportunity to have 

indeed intelligent debate.  Um let me also preface my remarks by

saying that my comments tonight are mine alone and don't 

necessarily reflect the views of my uh program.  Let me pick up 

the argument where my friend Stan left it and it is that the 

inability to transcend the dominant misrepresentation of the 

Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, is increasingly becoming 

problematic for both intelligent debate and informed policy 

making.  It is a narrative that most people know to be  

problematic if not faulty.  Yet is persists.  Tonight's motion fits 

that pattern.  And I invite you to reject it on grounds of 

inaccuracy and lack of intelligence for that matter.  Hamas is not 

a terrorist organization.  Hamas was the radicalized military 

expression of a national liberation movement, which grew into a 

social movement.  Hamas is no longer a terrorist organization.  

Hamas has moved to a political contest which it has joined 

legitimately and has won fairly.  More importantly, Hamas holds 

high levels of legitimacy among the majority of the people that it 

has been elected to represent and lead.  Now before developing 

these arguments um it is important to establish a set of facts, yet 

there is a familiar discourse, an emotional discourse about the 

plight of the Palestinians which I will not rehearse here tonight.  

It is a classical discourse which unfortunately has been, in  

recent years, rendered part of the background noise of world 

politics.  Triggering almost a sort of Palestine fatigue.  However, 

and in addition to the facts that Stanley has listed, it is the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 21. 

 
 
 

following facts that are crucial to the assessment of the situation 

and the proposed motion before us tonight.  Thirty-nine years of 

occupation, 1.4 million people in Gaza alone, in three hundred 

and sixty square kilometers.  Five hundred and forty checkpoints 

in the West Bank alone, with a forty percent increase in that 

number in the past year.  Settlements and buildings and land 

confiscation, the building of a separation wall, not a fence, a wall 

deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice.  Daily, near 

daily military incursions and sporadic killing, essentially almost 

half a century of Palestinian disposition, loss of life and freedom.  

Now in that most urgent of context, a group that emerges as a 

resistance movement, grows into a social network upgrading 

welfare centers and educational services, and agrees to abide by 

the rules of Democratic contest, can certainly no longer be called 

terrorist.   

 

Now Canadian definitions not withstanding, it is important, this 

is no mere matter of semantics to remember that the word 

“terrorist” is actually quite problematic when it comes to occupied 

people.  Yes, indeed the saying “Your terrorist is my freedom 

fighter” captures that inherent subjectivity quite well.  And some 

names were mentioned.  To those we can add just this past 

century, Michael Collins and the IRA, and I will not even mention 

the Haganah, the Irgun, Yitzhak Shamir and others.  Nelson 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 22. 

 
 
 

Mandela and the ANC and so on, all of these people have been 

called by their opponents terrorists.  The French resistance 

fighting the Germans, the FLN fighting the French.  Yet time and 

again, both these individuals and their movements led their 

groups to national leadership and oftentimes through elections.   

 

But the operative word of the motion is “still,” so is Hamas still a 

terrorist organization?  Well let us look at what Hamas has done 

in the past ten months since their election.  Even before that 

election, Hamas had decided on and implemented the unilateral 

cease fire.  Which it observed for fifteen months straight until the 

Israeli killing this past June of the seven members of Ghalia 

family.  Hamas had made former statements at the highest level 

of its multi-faceted representation regarding a disposition to enter 

this long-term truce.  Much is made of this concept of hudna.  It 

is important to understand that in fact, the phraseology used and 

the legal term is actually quite important in relation to an Islamic 

movement, which per force, obligates them too, and indeed is a 

form of protorecognition to begin with.  Hamas has been part of 

discussions throughout the summer and the fall on a draft 

document for a program that we quote, “respect previous 

agreements in a manner that protects and safeguards the high 

interest and the rights of the Palestinian people.”  Hamas had 

also proposed a coalition government back in March which 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 23. 

 
 
 

included Palestinian Christians and women and has folded its 

executive force into the former national police.  What have Israel, 

the EU, and the United States done in the same time frame?  

Insisting on this Three-Fold demand that Hamas recognizes 

Israel, forswears violence, and accepts previous Israeli-Palestinian 

agreements.  They have decreed and implemented a crippling 

international embargo with a new humanitarian crisis by UN 

reckoning, a security crisis by security specialists’ reckoning, and 

indeed some sort of Iraq-ization of Palestine with the birth in mid-

October of Al Qaeda and Palestine, which sent its first, a novelty 

by Palestinian standards.   

 

But at this point one is really prompted to think, what kind of 

international community is this that is so blind to the injustice 

that it rationalizes?  And the one that perpetuates out of ill-

conceived and inefficient policies, but the argument that I'm 

putting before you is not an emotional one.  It is not an 

ideological one, it is actually a rational one.  The obvious problem 

with the Three-Fold demand is the disappearance of reciprocity.  

For the very same three demands could be put, but are not, to 

Israel.  Israel has yet to recognize the existence of a Palestinian 

state on the 1967 borders.  Israel has yet to stop its use of 

violence against occupied people, including women and children, 

and Israel has yet to implement the very agreements that it’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 24. 

 
 
 

made with Palestinian representers.  It is therefore contradictory 

to depict Hamas as still a terrorist organization while punishing 

Palestinians for their democratic choice. 

 

It should also be said that we’re in effect, asking Hamas to be 

held to agreements which we no longer trust.  While everyone is 

saying that Oslo is dead and that we need new thinking and 

moving on, we’re asking this newcomer to be held to these 

agreements which have faded or are certainly fading.  And in 

effect, holding them to our own liabilities and failures.  

Contradictions are also displayed through a reading of the fact.  

There is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism, which is 

already an evidence of that problem.  However, by law what 

qualifies a group as a group, an entity as terrorists is the 

indiscriminate targeting of civilians.  So for the law to have any 

consistence, currency, it has to be applied across the board with 

certain selectivity.   

 

Which leads me to my last element, [CHUCKLES].  Hamas is an 

adolescent Hezbollah, and look at what Hezbollah has become 

next door.  The strongest power in Lebanon and the first one to 

ever defeat Israel.  So there’s a sort of the assumption that Hamas 

can be extricated from that political reality is unrealistic.  Ladies 

and gentlemen, given half a chance, Prime Minister Ismail Haniya

and his Hamas colleagues are Gerry Adamses in the making.  

Voting for this motion essentially means endorsing and 

supporting a unilateral, sterile understanding of this conflict.  I 

invite you to exercise intelligence, display fairness, and vote 

against the motion.  Thank you for your attention.  [APPLAUSE]  

JUDY WOODRUFF 
And against the proposition, I'm sorry for the proposition, I 

misspoke.  For the proposition, Daniel Ayalon.  [APPLAUSE]  

DANIEL AYALON 
Thank you very much.  Can you hear me?  Now start the clock 

now.  Good evening, thank you very much for being here.  With 

all due respect to my colleagues and my team, Steven Cook and 

John O’Sullivan who did a fantastic job, I must even thank more 

our adversaries, Stanley Cohen and Mahmoud, which did a great 

job actually convincing you I'm sure, to actually vote for the 

motion that Hamas is a terror organization.  Actually I will depart.  

Naively I thought that uh, they will relate to the nature of Hamas.  

What do they do?  What do they believe in?  What is their 

conduct?  But no, they actually opened the debate to a more 

geopolitical and historic um, issues which actually leave me on a 

much firmer ground.  So I will depart from the notes I prepared 

here and I will answer the, my esteemed colleagues here on the 

other side who talked about occupation, who talked about Israeli 

aggression, who talked about UN resolutions, and I will say 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 26. 

 
 
 

something which is very, very simple.  Israel was attacked in 

1967 by three countries around us, Jordan, Egypt, and Syria.  

The “Occupation,” quote-unquote as they call it, is this territory 

which was obtained by Israel as an act of self-defense.  These 

three countries and others were trying to push us into the sea 

and actually destroy Israel, destroy the Jewish people who came 

back to their historic land, to their Biblical land, to the place 

where they belong.  Now, the war happened in 1967.  Israel was 

created in 19-, or was recreated in 1948.  From 1948 to 1967, 

nineteen years, there was no occupation.  West Bank belonged to 

Jordan, Gaza belonged to uh, Egypt, nobody talked about 

occupation then.  Nobody talked about creating a Palestinian 

state.  ]  You know why?  Because they wanted to create this 

Palestinian state right where Israel is now today, killing all the 

Jews.  So from 1967 on, against her will, we had to defend 

ourselves and obtain possession of these territories.  But still, we 

always wanted peace.  The proof, 1977.  When we had a leader 

like Anwar Sadat of Egypt, and he signed a peace treaty with us 

and he renounced terror and violence and he recognized Israel, 

Israel withdrew entirely from the Sinai, having peace with Jordan 

now for more than thirty years, uh, with Egypt for more than 

thirty years.  1995, Jordan, King Hussein, a great leader, wanted 

to make peace.  We made peace.  We withdrew from some, all the 

land that we occupied from Jordan and there is a peace between 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 27. 

 
 
 

Israel and Jordan, recognizing each other, respecting each other, 

and not shooting at each other.  In 1993, Israel, believing that the 

Palestinians really had a change of heart and they would like to 

make peace with us, we signed as the Oslo Accord.  And the Oslo 

Accord was a very simple view, land for peace.  Israel withdrawing 

from West Bank in Gaza, the Palestinians got a hold of 

themselves, stopped the terror, and becoming a responsible party.  

2000, Camp David, former Prime Minister Barak meeting with uh, 

with Arafat to try and make peace.  Barak is offering to withdraw 

from the entire territories, but this was not accepted by Arafat.  

Not only was it not accepted, but after it was rejected, this 

intifada started.  Intifada is a misnomer, it was a very planned, 

pre-planned campaign of terror which cost more than a thousand 

Israeli lives, many children, devastation in our cities, and uh, 

continued rejection of the very notion of the right of Israel to exist 

in its home land.  Now people compare between Camp David ’78 

that succeeded with Saddam Hussein, with, with us with Sadat.  

I'm very tired, I came back from Israel not a few hours ago, 

between Sadat and Arafat, Camp David 2000.  What was the 

difference?  The difference was leadership.  Sadat wanted to make 

peace.  He prevailed over the advice of his advisors and signed a 

peace treaty.  Arafat also unfortunately prevailed over the advice 

of his advisors who said sign the peace treaty because you will 

not get a better deal.  And he was against it.  Now Hamas was 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 28. 

 
 
 

against Arafat.  They did not even believe in any negotiations.  

They are against, and they were against Oslo, why?  Because they 

do not believe in Israel’s right to exist.  They do not believe in 

coexistence, they do not believe in peace.  They do not believe 

even, in a democracy.  Because they would like to have one 

Islamist Palestinian country a la Iran, Iran style and under the 

Sharia, the, the, the law of, of Islam.  So lets go back to the 

debate tonight. What is the definition of terror?  Killing 

intentionally of innocent people.  What does Hamas do?  Killing 

only, only children and innocent people.  They stand terrorists 

strapped in explosives into markets, into pizzerias, into coffee 

shops, and into school buses and kindergartens.  This is what 

they do.  Are they a terrorist organization?  If this is the definition 

of terror, they definitely are a terrorist organization.  

 

Secondly, do they believe in coexistence?  No, they deny Israel’s 

right to exist.  Now people here are talking about whether elected 

democratically or not, this is besides the point.  Just look into the 

Hamas, www.hamas.com in their website on the internet and look 

into the Hamas charter.  They believe in killing, they don’t believe 

in Israel, they don’t believe in any peace.  So are they a terror 

organization?  According to this definition, they are as well.  Now 

there is another issue here.  Who is Hamas operated by?  Are 

they really doing the will of the people?  I don't think so.  My 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 29. 

 
 
 

esteemed colleague here on the other side, Stanley Cohen said he 

just returned from Damascus and he met Khaled Meshaal?  

Where did he meet Khaled Meshaal?  In Damascus.  Who is really 

operating Khaled Meshaal?  The Syrians, and the Iranians.  So 

they’re not really playing.  They’re not really representing 

Palestinian authentic interest.  They are representing the interest 

of this crazy Islamist in Iran, and in Damascus.  Are they a terror 

organization?  I think yes, I think all of you should vote for this 

motion.   

 

Now there is this question whether they were democratically 

elected.  Well I would say a broad definition of democracy is you 

know, doing the will of the people but also observing the rule of 

law.  And the rule of law does not permit gangs to be brandishing 

their guns and going with bullets into the ballots.  Uh, don’t take 

just the case of Hamas.  Look at what happens.  I mean we 

should apply this global world, global community, the same 

yardstick for everywhere.  There were elections held in Iraq, in 

Afghanistan, in the former Yugoslavia.  In all these elections, 

armed gangs were denied the right of voting and also of being 

elected.  The same case should have been with Hamas but for 

some reason, this thing was ignored and Hamas was allowed to 

run.  And I think this was a mistake.  Unfortunately, Hamas won 

but it’s not because the people voted for their ideology –

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Time’s up.   

DANIEL AYALON 
It’s because it was a protest vote against Fatah which was corrupt 

and ineffective.  So this is the reason why Hamas was elected.  

Did it change their character?  Not at all.  Does a formal process 

change intrinsically what Hamas stand for?  Now after the 

elections, they still are killing.  There are more than a thousand 

rockets fired from Gaza into our towns, killing babies and 

children, and there’s no reason for that since we left Gaza 

entirely.  We left Gaza entirely in order to give Palestinians a 

chance to show everybody that they can govern themselves 

responsibly.  That they can do away with terror and incitement 

and start negotiation with us.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Time is up.  

DANIEL AYALON 
Just vote for the motion.  [APPLAUSE]   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
And the final opening argument is an argument against from 

Mark Perry.  [APPLAUSE]   

MARK PERRY 
The problem, the problem isn’t that Hamas is a terrorist 

organization.  The problem is that Hamas is a Muslim 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 31. 

 
 
 

organization, that’s what scares the hell out of us.  And we ought 

to put it all out on the table and just say it.  And how do we know 

that?  Because the United States has dealt with terrorist 

organizations throughout its history and so has Israel.  There 

were no preconditions for any talks with the PLO in 1993.  And 

Yasser Arafat made sure of that.  He said, we’ll recognize you 

after you talk to us.  That was no preconditions.  Why do we have 

conditions on Hamas?  Because they’re Muslims, they don’t look 

like us, we say they don’t have our values.  How do I know that 

we deal with terrorist organizations?  Because tomorrow the 

president of the United States is meeting with a man by the name 

of Nouri al-Maliki.  Who is he?  Nouri al-Maliki is the head of the 

Dawa Party.  Who is the Dawa Party?  The Dawa Party opposed 

Saddam Hussein when we supported Saddam Hussein.  We put 

them on the terrorism list.  When we changed sides, we took 

them off the terrorism list.  That doesn’t matter.  They bombed 

the US Embassy in Kuwait and killed three Americans.  We’re 

talking to him because it’s in our interest to talk to him, terrorist 

or not.   

 

So what is the problem with Hamas?  Well if you listen to the 

media and if you listen to our political leaders, here’s what they 

have to say.  They don’t have our values.  Our Judeo-Christian 

values.  What values would those be?  I'm a nice white boy from 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 32. 

 
 
 

Wisconsin, grew up as a Lutheran.  And I can tell you in my 

religion and I had to memorize through an ordeal the catechism 

of Martin Luther, one of the real anti-Semites of our era.  They do 

not have a legitimacy.  How do political parties and movements 

gain legitimacy?  It’s not conferred by Israel or the United States 

as conferred by the people.  They won an election.  Oh no, their 

critics say.  They didn’t win the election, Fatah lost it.  Okay.  

Fatah lost it because Fatah couldn't organize itself credibly and 

competently to stand for election and because Fatah accepted 

twenty million dollars in American election aid.  And as soon as 

that came out in The Washington Post and was reprinted in the 

West Bank in Gaza, they lost votes.  They want to destroy Israel, 

so did the PLO.  They have a charter that says they want to 

destroy Israel.  So do the PLO.  And yet we’ve had Hamas leaders 

that say the following.  We have a charter that says, yes we admit 

it, we want to destroy Israel.  But the charter’s not the Quran, 

and it can be changed.  And under the right circumstances, if we 

can talk to our adversaries, we can and we will change it.   

 

The other argument that we say, we’ve heard it tonight.  They 

provide social services.  Oh cynical people, how could they do 

that?  You mean they’re actually trying to serve their people, clear 

up corruption?  I too was talking to Hamas leaders when I was in 

the Middle East.  Just one week ago, Osama Hamdan, the foreign 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 33. 

 
 
 

minister of Hamas, here’s what they’ve done.  They’ve penetrated 

the Education Health Ministries, cleaned them up, that’s forty 

percent of the total employment of the government of Palestine.  

They’ve thrown out the corrupt people.  They’ve taken over the 

Ministry, they’ve started to provide services to people.  They’ve 

kicked out Fatah members who are in exile around the world for 

stealing money from the Palestinian people.  Don’t we want good 

governance?  Shouldn't we talk to people who want good 

governance, who stand for elections?  They kill innocent people.  

They have killed innocent people, rudely, terribly, like others 

have.  It’s not an excuse to say, well the Israelis have done it.  

Well Lehi did it.  That’s not an excuse.  They’ve killed innocent 

people and they come out to be absolved.  But after long 

discussions with Hamas, conducted by my organization, painful 

discussions, arguments about the killing of innocents, not moral 

arguments, practical, effective, political arguments.  They 

stopped.  I’d like to take credit.  They stopped these suicide 

bombers through talk because they realized how ineffective they 

were, how they were losing support for what they feel is a 

legitimate cause.  There hasn’t been a Hamas-led suicide 

bombing in Israel since August of 2004.  That’s a fact.  People can 

change.   

 

There are three conditions for Hamas being recognized as a 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 34. 

 
 
 

legitimate political party.  To renounce violence, to give up their 

arms, and to recognize Israel.  We’ve been through this and 

through this with Hamas, and we’ve said why don’t you do this?  

And the best answer that I’ve had from a Hamas leader is as 

followed.  If we do that, if we renounce violence, if we give up our 

arms, and if we recognize Israel, what’s there to talk about?  

What do we talk to our enemies about?  Do you think we’re going 

to say, oh welcome to the world of nations?  Finally we’ll withdraw 

to the sixty-seven borders?  Here’s what we would like.  We will 

recognize Israel, Khaled Meshaal has said this very straight 

forward in Damascus again and again and again and again.  We 

understand and we recognize that the Israeli people, the Jewish 

people have a narrative, it’s an important narrative.  We’ve 

listened to it for many, many years.   

 

We have a narrative.  Here’s our narrative.  In 1948, we lived on a 

land that was called Palestine.  Many of us were kicked off our 

land and now live in refugee camps.  We have legitimate 

grievances.  If you will recognize our legitimate grievances, and 

recognize our narrative as a people, we can begin to share a 

narrative, to have talks.  But until that point comes, when you 

stand up and say we understand that you have grievances that 

have to be addressed, we’re not going to recognize anybody.  

We’re going to represent our people.  Now here’s what’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 35. 

 
 
 

happening, I think, in the Middle East.  Now, and I just returned 

from Beirut.  There are, on the internet, calls for the 

assassination of the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas by the 

leaders of Al Qaeda.  Why?  Because Hamas and Hezbollah have 

accepted the western, colloidal mandate, to stand for elections 

and represent their people.  Al Qaeda thinks that’s a trick.  

Hamas and Hezbollah don’t.  They answer to their people.  We are 

lumping together the Girondists with the Jacobins.  We are 

lumping together the true reformers in the Middle East, the ones 

who want to answer to their people with the people who drove 

their airplanes into our buildings.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
One.  

MARK PERRY 
We are forcing the Gironde – for those of you who remember 

French history – into the mountain, into the Jacobins.  It is, it is 

so counterproductive.  We are radicalizing the region.  There are 

moderates in Islam.  They’re called Hamas whether we like it or 

not.  And it’s time to open up to them.  I thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Thank you very much to our six debaters, three for and three 

against.  And I'm now ready to announce to tell you the results of 

the vote that was taken before tonight’s debate began.  Before the 

debate, we’ve counted the ballots.  One hundred and sixty-one of 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 36. 

 
 
 

you voted for the motion.  Fifty-one of you voted against the 

motion.  And fifty-six of you said you didn’t know.  And to remind, 

the motion is “A democratically-elected Hamas is still a terrorist 

organization.”  Again, a hundred and sixty-one in favor, fifty-one 

against and fifty-six of you said you had not made up your mind.  

Now we are ready to begin the audience question portion of the 

program.  I'm going to call on the questioners.  Uh, we have 

someone on each side of the auditorium here who is going to 

come to you with a microphone and we ask that you stand uh, 

when you ask your question.  And we also ask that you please 

make your question short and to the point.  We ask that members 

of the press, identify yourselves, uh, tell us who you are.  And we 

ask that members of the audience who are not in the press uh, 

we want to tell you, you have the option to either identify yourself 

or not.  So we will get underway and lets see, we have a question 

here in the front, yes.   

WOMAN  
Um, this is for the people who are for the motion.  It seems that 

the US wants democratically elected uh, governments in the 

Middle East only if it’s one that they like.  Not just Hamas, but for 

example the reticence to have free and fair elections in Egypt out 

of concern that the Muslim Brotherhood would prevail.  Isn’t that 

a little bit hypocritical, and as a corollary to that, when these 

groups are actually voted in, doesn’t the necessity of governance 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 37. 

 
 
 

and the compromises they have to make in order to govern 

moderate them anyway?   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Is that directed at one individual or any one of those?   

WOMAN 
Mr. O’Sullivan.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Alright.   

JOHN O’SULLIVAN 
I, I may take a different view from some of my colleagues on this 

side of the aisle on this question.  Um as a matter of fact, my 

sticking point is violence.  Do you, do groups who are standing for 

election continue to advocate and practice violence?  That’s, to me 

is the sine qua non, if they do, if they maintain a private army, if 

they are uh, if they are acting as for example, um, the IRA 

continued to act for some years after the Good Friday agreement, 

I'm against that.  Now I think in the case of uh, Islamist standing 

for election, I'm absolutely in favor of it.  I think the American 

government is taking a risk in, in urging free elections when it 

will, they’ll sometimes bring to power people who are hostile to 

American foreign policy.  But that’s a risk which we have to take.  

After all, it’s a risk which we take with every other part of the 

world and, and we have to live with that.  I think in the case of 

Hamas, we put ourselves in a somewhat false position and my 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 38. 

 
 
 

pos-, and this is a rather complicated point here, but once we had 

accepted the legitimacy of Hamas standing, it seems to me we 

had crossed that Rubicon.  And once they, having, their having 

been elected, we simply had to accept that they were, they were 

there.  I would not have said that they were a legitimate 

contender in the election myself until, as I say, they’d abandoned 

violence which is my, in a sense, not my sole criterion, perhaps, 

but my overriding criterion.   
STEVEN A. COOK 

Can I just add something to that Judy?  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Sure.   

STEVEN A. COOK 
On this question of the United States only liking the people that 

gets elected, and you mentioned the issue of Egypt and since I'm 

writing a book about Egypt, I, I, I feel compelled to respond.  

There’s not a single Egyptian official, nor is there a single 

American government official who believes who has, that the 

United States is no longer pressing the Egyptians on democratic 

reform.  It’s just not true.  In fact I was in Cairo in September, 

and at the same time that the United States government 

presented papers to the Egyptian government that included 

benchmarks for democratic change.  And that is even with eighty-

eight members of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Egyptian 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 39. 

 
 
 

Parliament.  The difference between the Muslim Brotherhood in 

Hamas is that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has not engaged 

in an act of violence since at least the 1970s.  You can’t say the 

same thing about Hamas.  Well that’s terrific, they haven’t –  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
[OVERLAPPING VOICES]  Well that’s because there’s, there’s been 

a million, there’s been a million people that belong to the Muslim 

Brotherhood and probably two hundred thousand in Egypt that 

are in jail because they’re –  

STEVEN A. COOK 
Hold it, Stanley.   

STANLEY L. COHEN 
As, as soon as the Muslim Brotherhood tries to run for election, 

they get jailed.  They get tortured.  They get, eighty-eight, eighty-

eight members.   

STEVEN A. COOK 
No, no, no, no, come on Stanley.  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Who’s controlling Egypt?  The Brotherhood?   

STEVEN A. COOK 
We clearly know -  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
No, no.

STEVEN A. COOK 
We clearly know who’s controlling Egypt.   

STANLEY L. COHEN 
The question asked is –  

STEVEN A. COOK 
It’s certainly not the Muslim Brotherhood.   

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Do we support democracies –  

STEVEN A. COOK 
But they did –  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
And do we oppose democracies that we don’t and the reality of it 

is –  

STEVEN A. COOK 
You know -  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
When Musharraf –  

STEVEN A. COOK 
Actually you know this.  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Musharraf became – 

STEVEN A. COOK 
You have absolutely no understanding of what the US 

government is doing right now to promote democracy in the

Middle East.  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Ask the audience.   

STEVEN A. COOK 
This is all very entertaining - 

STANLEY L. COHEN 
They see it every night on television what the United States is 

doing to promote democracy.  If you're with us, you're okay.  If 

you're not, you're a good Muslim or a bad Muslim, Mr. Bush, it 

doesn’t change no matter what you want to call it.   

MARK PERRY 
Who’s going to be the next president of Egypt?  You think it’s 

going to be democratically elected?  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Right.  

MARK PERRY 
Or is it going to be -  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Or Jordan, or Jordan.  That other bastion of support, progressive 

ideology that the Israeli ambassadors supports.  You're good if 

you're with us and if you're not, you're not.  And it really doesn’t 

matter.  If you follow our politics, you're a good guy, and if you 

don’t, you're trafe [not kosher].  How is that, expert in Egypt?

DANIEL AYALON 
Well I think this is, I think that this is really nonsense.  I think 

we are here talking, you know, in just slogans, democracy and 

first of all we have to remember, you know elections, democracy 

doesn’t start with elections, it doesn’t end with elections.  There is 

a culture, there is, there should be a rule of law, there should be 

a participation of all walks of life in a society.  Unfortunately we 

have a backwards situation in all the Muslim and Arab countries 

where there is no, basically there is no middle class.  There is 

only elite who really control all the resources, all the political 

power, all the economics, and everything else and all the others 

are poor, uneducated.  And they, and really they are subject to 

the incitement of the ideological zealots from Iran -  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
What an arrogant statement to talk about five thousand year old 

culture –  

STEVEN A. COOK  
Stanley, chill out, you’ll get an opportunity.   

DANIEL AYALON 
I'm talking about facts, I'm just talking about facts.  So what I, 

what I would answer to you is no, we should not promote 

democracy in the Middle East.  What we should promote is equal 

opportunities.  What we should promote is empowerment of 

women.  What we should p-, uh, promote is good education for 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 43. 

 
 
 

the people so there’s not these inequalities.  And when the people 

themselves will have a stake in their own lives, in their societies, 

they will decide what type of regime they do want.  [APPLAUSE]   

MARK PERRY 
What the ambassador means to say is, there won't be a vote until 

the people are ready which is just exactly what J. Edgar Hoover 

said about African Americans in America –  

MAN 
Please.   

MARK PERRY 
Thirty years ago.   

DANIEL AYALON 
This has nothing to do with that and uh, irrelevant.  

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
Just a quick comment on this, with all due respect to the 

ambassador –  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
And then we’ll get to the next question. 

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
Yeah, I, I, this is precisely what I meant by unilateral 

understanding.  We, I mean we, here again, we have to decide 

this, we have to support, we have, it’s, it’s, it’s very, very 

materialistic.  It’s as if all of these populations have no sense of 

what is important to them, what is legitimate for them, who 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 44. 

 
 
 

stands for them.  I mean Fatah has lost all credibility in that, in 

that area not simply because of external support, essentially for 

what they’ve done with the b-building of apartments in Dubai and 

so on and so forth.  The people know who stands for them, people 

know who will defend them.  And if Hamas has left that scene 

which was, as I said, a military scene as, and has chosen to 

represent the democratic, uh, in a democratic way this, these 

groups, then it’s something that speaks for the values of these 

people.  And keep in mind as well, who was fielded in these 

elections.  Pharmacists, doctors, professors, I mean business, 

women, this is not simply a group of, as you called them earlier, 

“thugs in limousines.”  Khaled Meshaal, last weekend at his, last 

week in his press conference, was citing Foreign Affairs articles by 

Richard Haass.  I mean we really have to be a little bit more 

sophisticated –  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
We’ve had –  

DANIEL AYALON 
Let me just mention to you, you're mentioning –  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Good discussion now on this question and I think we do need to 

move to the next –  

DANIEL AYALON 
No but this is very important Judy.

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 45. 

 
 
 

JUDY WOODRUFF  
We can get each of you –  

DANIEL AYALON 
I think it’s important because they keep raising this issue of –  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Well –  

DANIEL AYALON 
Being pharmacists and doctors.  

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
Yes.   

DANIEL AYALON 
And all that, let me tell you –  

STEVEN A. COOK 
Just because you're a pharmacist –  

DANIEL AYALON 
There are millions –  

STEVEN A. COOK 
Doesn’t mean you're not a terrorist.  

DANIEL AYALON 
There are millions of engineers and doctors.  

STEVEN A. COOK 
Osama Bin Laden is a civil engineer, come on.   

 DANIEL AYALON 
And professors and musicians in the thirties who voted for the

Nazi party which brought on the Holocaust.   

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU  
I think that’s an unfair –  

DANIEL AYALON 
With doctors –  

STEVEN A. COOK 
Lawyers, pharmacists.  

DANIEL AYALON 
Professors –  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
And the guy who – [OVERLAPPING VOICES] President of the 

United States, it begs the question.   

DANIEL AYALON 
And what they believe in, this is what should be the yardstick.  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Alright. 

DANIEL AYALON 
Not their diplomas.  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
As long as the Iranians and Syrians tell them what to do, is that 

correct?   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
We are going - 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 47. 

 
 
 

STANLEY L. COHEN 
As long as the Iranians the Syrians tell them…  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
We are not going to resolve this now, we need to let the next 

person have a question.  Yes, I believe, yes sir, you’ve been 

patiently waiting.   

MAN  
Hi, my question is for the against side, specifically for the 

gentleman who have had direct conversations with Hamas.  If 

Hamas refuses to recognize Israel, how can the organization 

support a two-state solution?   

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Well long before there was Hamas, you know you got to, 

governments say things all the time.  People say things all the 

time.  If Hamas tomorrow said, we recognize the state of Israel or 

the right of Israel to exist, the ambassador would say prove it.  

Come back to us in twenty years, when you’ve shown we’ll accept 

it for twenty years.  The reality of it is, I'm not concerned about 

what people say they will do, I'm more concerned about what in 

fact they do, do, and on the ground.  The reality of it is that 

you’ve got statements that have come as close as they’re going to 

come.  That talk about if we go back to the sixty-seven borders, 

that is the starting point and that’s where we’re going to move.  

Everyday the United States government makes statements.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 48. 

 
 
 

There’s weapons of mass destruction, we go in through Iraq.  You 

know what, no weapons of mass destruction.  Don’t get hung up 

on the rhetoric of labels, don’t get hung up on we recognize your 

right to exist.  What about recognizing the right of return?  

Stanley Cohen can go home, but if my name is Mahmoud, I can’t 

go home.  So you have to be reciprocal.  I haven’t heard a word 

from Israel about the right of return, I haven’t heard a word from 

Israel about the right to a government, I haven’t heard a word 

from Israel about the right to recognize what the Palestinian 

people want.   

DANIEL AYALON 
You’ll hear it pretty soon from me -  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
We want unilateral concessions.  

DANIEL AYALON 
Can I, can I answer to that?  Well don’t judge us and don’t tell me 

what Israel will say for twenty more years.  Just judge us by our 

deeds.  When Egypt was ready to recognize Israel, we signed a 

peace treaty, the same with Jordan, the same with the PLO, and I 

take issue, I think it’s incorrect what you mentioned here.  Israel 

was ready to recognize the PLO and talk to them only and only 

after Yitzhak Rabin received a letter signed by Yasser Arafat, 

ninth of September, ’93, which renounced terror, which 

recognized Israel’s right to exist, and which also promised to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 49. 

 
 
 

change this charter that you were talking about.  This is exactly 

what we’re expecting from Hamas.  And this is not just an Israeli 

expectation, this is a demand by the entire international 

community as was expressed by the quartet, the four parties that 

are responsible for the peace process in the Middle East.  Which 

called for the Hamas after they were elected, they said okay, you 

were elected, it doesn’t matter if it was democratically or not, it 

doesn’t matter if you're a terror organization, lets look and move 

forward.  And Israel is in that camp, lets look and move forward, 

not about what you did, the fact that you already fired Qassam 

rockets this morning, killing a baby in Sderot.  Lets look to the 

future and we still say, if you renounce terror, if you recognize 

Israel’s right to exist and you abolish your charter.   

 

And now also if you accept our previous agreements which were 

signed by the PLO, then you are a le-, legitimate parter, partner.  

But they’re not doing that because they’re still a terror 

organization, because they do not believe in coexistence and they 

do believe not in building a nation but destroying one, which is 

ours.  And we are not going to let them do that.  You're talking 

about, Stanley Cohen, about the right of return.  What kind of 

right of return?  There’s no right of return.  There are, there were 

Arabs there which we wanted to coexist with them, but they 

refused -  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 50. 

 
 
 

STANLEY L. COHEN 
It’s all, it’s all, it’s all a conspiracy between Iran and Syria.  Eight 

hundred thousand people just woke up and moved.   

DANIEL AYALON 
Just read, just read the history, just read the history and then 

you will know, there is not such a thing as right of return.  There 

is a problem of the refugees, this is true.  There is a refugee 

problem, but the responsibility for the refugee problems lie on the 

heads of the leaders of the Palestinians and of the Arabs.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Alright.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
We have a question, I see a hand right there.   

MICHAEL BROWN 
My name is Michael Brown, I'm a freelance writer.  There’s 

something that seems very myopic about this conversation with 

the war raging in Iran and, and Lebanon.  This, this sort of 

insoluble binary seems to have spread to the whole world in 

terms of who’s a terrorist, who’s a democrat, who’s right and 

who’s wrong.  You hear repeatedly that the key to peace of a 

region and the world is in the Israel-Palestine conflict.  This is for 

anyone in the panel, if you still think that that’s true.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
For anyone on the panel.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 51. 

 
 
 

MICHAEL BROWN 
Yeah.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Alright we’ll, we’ll begin with this side because we heard last.   

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
Well I think you, and let me if I may, remind us of the motion that 

this debate is not about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the 

motion is about the last ten months and it, whether Hamas is still 

a terrorist organization.  And the facts are that everything that 

Hamas did over the past month, ten months cannot be qualified 

as terrorist.  I mean you can come up with –  

DANIEL AYALON 
Indiscriminate firing at children –  

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
Well –  

DANIEL AYALON 
Schools, they’re all –  

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
It’s interesting you should say that, you know I, because when 

you look at it, you will find out that, sir, I think you should know 

that, this was actually the violations that came, came from the 

Fatah side.  And the Fatah was associated with that as well as –  

DANIEL AYALON 
Not at all. 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 52. 

 
 
 

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
Ghazi Hamad is the name of the person that actually speaks 

about these matters and you can go and check and, and see every 

one of the actions that was in violation was denounced by Hamas 

officially.  So again, facts or statements?   

MAN 
Who holds Corporal Shalit which was kidnapped in our territory?  

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
Well I wouldn't know.  

DANIEL AYALON 
It’s the Hamas.  What you wouldn't know –  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Who holds the ten thousand Palestinians sitting in jails that 

haven’t seen –  

MAN  
But who holds –  

DANIEL AYALON 
They are all terrorists and this is the difference.   

STANLEY L. COHEN 
They’re all terrorists?   

MAN 
Thirty-seven legislators –  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
All ten thousand of them.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 53. 

 
 
 

DANIEL AYALON 
Oh absolutely. 

STANLEY L. COHEN 
All ten thousand Palestinians including the fourteen-year-old –  

DANIEL AYALON 
Let me tell you that – 

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Then what are you afraid of?  Put them on trial.  

DANIEL AYALON 
Let me tell you that they are not –  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Put them on trial. 

DANIEL AYALON 
It’s not just the ten thousand there. 

STANLEY L. COHEN

DANIEL AYALON 
There are fifty thousand more.  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
You have a democracy.  

DANIEL AYALON 
Mm-hmm.   

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Let them go, let them have trials.  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 54. 

 
 
 

DANIEL AYALON 
They are all –  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Prove your case.  

DANIEL AYALON 
They are all being trialed, they are all being processed.   

MAN  
Let me, let me –  

DANIEL AYALON 
And I wish the same chance was given to the Israeli kids that are 

being targeted by these guys.  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Oops.  I know there we go again, every time those darn 

Palestinians get in the way of our missiles and our tanks and end 

up dead. Whoops, there it goes again.  But yet when we do it, 

we’re sorry.  But you, you target and that’s the moral superiority.  

So the mor-, the moral position that you’ve always taken.  Look, 

it’s terrible when civilians on both sides get killed.  It’s terrible, 

it’s got to stop and the way you stop it is you dare to struggle.  

You break the labels, you sit down with no preconditions and you 

try to move ahead.  And if it doesn’t work, you're right back to 

where you were but at least there’s a chance.   

DANIEL AYALON 
Absolutely, this is exactly what we want.  We, we say stop the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 55. 

 
 
 

killing, stop the terror and we will sit and talk.  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
And what about your side?   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Question.   

DANIEL AYALON 
What we will talk about, what we will talk about?  The road map 

to peace.  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
We only have about four minutes left for questions so I do want to 

recognize someone there in the very back, please, stand up.  

MAN  
I have a question.  My name is Goldin [PH] and I'm a teacher.  I 

have a question to Mr. Cohen.  If your argument [INAUDIBLE] 

Hamas, with that said, with everything going on according to your 

plan and you would be, would you go for even a short visit to 

Israel just to recognize, just to receive congratulation?  Would you 

take such a risk? 

STANLEY L. COHEN 
I go to Israel all the time.  In fact, in fact sir, sir… Sir, I lost family 

in a bombing in Jerusalem, I lost family in World War II, I cannot 

tell you how difficult it is for me as a Jew to sit back and for sixty 

years, watch what has occurred – [OVERLAPPING VOICES]  And 

not just in the name of people in Israel, but in the names of Jews 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 56. 

 
 
 

all over the world.  The answer is yes, I would go, and yes I would 

gladly do what has to be done to break bread and to try to bring 

some sanity to this war of labeling.  That’s the problem.  We are 

so locked into labels, we are so locked into an inability.  You must 

do this or I’ll do that, I must do this or you’ll do that.  There’s 

absolutely no down side to sitting down without preconditions 

and talking.   

MAN 
Absolutely.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
John O’Sullivan.  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]  John O’Sullivan has 

been asking –  

JOHN O’SULLIVAN 
I think that there is, just on the general point here, there are 

consequences to launching unsuccessful wars against Israel.  The 

first is that Israel ends up with territories which didn’t originally 

belong to it, the second is that there are going to be large 

numbers of refugees, and the third is that the Israelis, given their 

strategic, long-term vulnerability are going to be very suspicious 

of proposals for peace that don’t come accompanied by 

guarantees.  But do come accompanied by demands for a right of 

return that would negate the Jewish state altogether.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Okay.  We, we have time for one more audience question, 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 57. 

 
 
 

preferably a short one, and please tell us who it’s directed to and 

lets see.  Where do we, do we have someone with a microphone 

up there?  Okay, go ahead.   

MAN  
I’d like to ask two brief questions, and I’d like to thank Mr. 

O’Sullivan –  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Let’s make it one.  

MAN 
Okay.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
We have two minutes.  

MAN 
I’d like to thank Mr. O’Sullivan and Mr. Perry for I think making 

the most uh, intelligent arguments tonight.  Um, I just want to 

ask the For side how they, if they feel that political power is a uh, 

moderating force on uh, extremists.  And how their view of 

terrorism uh, is consistent with the actions of David Ben-Gurion 

and the bombing of the King David Hotel.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Who would like to pick, Steven?   

MAN 
I’ll –  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 58. 

 
 
 

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Steven Cook.   

STEVEN A. COOK 
I’ll go for it, thank you very much.  Um, I think that there’s really 

no condition.  The pothole theory of politics, that somehow 

Hamas, which is dedicated to a broader, ideological agenda, is 

someone going to have to pick up the garbage, that that is going 

to moderate their view of the world.  That certainly didn’t happen 

with the PLO once it returned to Gaza, I don't expect it will 

happen with Hamas.  Now of course the question of bomb, of the 

King David Hotel, everybody trucks that out as, as evidence of 

terrorism, the fact that the, the Israeli, Israelis before, in the pre-

state era engaged in terrorism.  My understanding of the bombing 

of the King David Hotel was that it was not directed specifically 

against innocent civilians, but it was against British occupation, 

authorities.  That is not consistent with the definition of 

terrorism.   

INTERVIEWER  
Alright.  Uh, thank –  

JOHN O’SULLIVAN 
There, there were terrorist acts against British troops, during the 

war, by the way, just to make that point.   

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Oh.

PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 59. 

 
 
 

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Alright, it is now, it is now time for all of you in the audience, this 

is the moment, this is time to vote.  This is the ticket, pull it out 

of your pocket or your lap, wherever it is, your handbag.  If you 

want to vote for the motion, tear off the “For,” the green For from 

the ticket, the top of the ticket, and slip it into the ballet box that 

will be passed among you.  If you want to vote against, tear off 

“Against,” the red.  Tear off the red Against and put that into the 

ballot box.  And if you do not know which side you're on, if you 

are undecided, put your entire ticket into the ballot box.  The 

ballot boxes are going to be passed around the ushers, the front 

and the back of the auditorium.  Pass it to the next person, we 

want to make sure everybody’s vote is counted.  If you need a 

ticket, just wave your arm in the air, the ushers have extra 

tickets.  Everyone gets one vote, [CHUCKLES].  And now we’re 

going to turn, while you're finishing this up, we’re going to turn to 

the panelists, beginning with the side opposing the motion.  And 

we are going to ask them to make their final argument.  So 

opposing the motion, against, Stanley Cohen.  Two minutes.  

STANLEY L. COHEN 
Sure a lot more difficult debating here than it was in Qatar or in 

Doha.  I have a friend, dear friend of mine, believe it or not, an 

Israeli.  Named Leah Tsemel, famous Israeli lawyer, she used to 

be called Arafat’s whore by Israeli politicians.  Leah said to me 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 60. 

 
 
 

one day when we were driving to the Erez crossing where we had 

to wait twelve hours to go in to see people, Leah said in response 

to a comment about how they want to drive us to the sea and 

drown us, Leah said the only one who’s going to drive us to the 

sea and drown us is ourselves.  The notions that Palestinians 

have nothing to do but to die or to kill after all of this time is the 

difficulty.  We see resistance as this desire and this need to be 

terrorists, to die and kill which is defied by what’s happening on 

the ground.  The real shame here, the real sin here is for the first 

time in history, Palestinian and Israeli kids aren’t going to schools 

together.  They’re not spending time together, they’re not falling 

in love together, they’re not doing businesses together.  And the 

problem is the walls of labels are keeping sides apart.  People say 

Hamas is a terrorist organization, I say Israel is a terrorist state.  

Who cares?  The two sides need to sit down without 

preconditions, see if you can find common ground as people to 

grow so those kids can fall in love again, thank you very much.  

[APPLAUSE]  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
And now for the motion, Steven A. Cook.  

STEVEN A. COOK 
It’s amazing, isn’t it?  Everything I told you would happen, 

happened.  Our interlocutors on the other side did not address 

the issue at hand, they shifted to Israeli behavior.  But I want to 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 61. 

 
 
 

respond to some specific things that each of them said to 

demonstrate how weak their arguments are.  And since Stanley 

impugned my credibility and my expertise, I’ll return the favor.  

Stanley spoke passionately ponytail waving, arms in the air, 

doing the whole hippie thing, talking about many or most in the 

world believe.  Come on Stanley, I got my Ph.D. because, I didn’t 

need to go to law school because I'm the son of a lawyer. You 

should know every first year law student knows that when you 

argue “many in the world,” “most in the world,” “most people 

believe,” it’s a logical fallacy.  Just because most people believe it 

doesn’t make it true.  What is Mahmoud talking about when he 

talks about protorecognition?  Is that like being half pregnant?  

You can’t be half pregnant, you either recognize or you don’t.  I 

had, throughout the 1990s, I spent my time parsing the words of 

Palestinian leaders, do they or do they not recognize, what is 

protorecognition?  Hudna means somehow recognition, but 

hudna’s in.  I don't understand it.  The majority of the 

Palestinians did not vote for Hamas.  Forty-four percent of the 

people voted for Hamas.  Now I'm sure the people on the other 

side of the room would say that George Bush was not 

democratically elected because the majority of Americans didn’t 

vote for him in 2000.  Well I would apply the same principle to 

Hamas.  I'm shocked, I'm actually shocked that Mark Perry’s 

interlocutor is Osama –

Fifteen seconds.   

STEVEN A. COOK 
Oh I’ll skip that part.  I’ll just say, I’ll just say that it is 

extraordinary that Mark Perry gave all the evidence you needed to 

vote for the proposition.  He said his Hamas interlocutor said that 

they would not give up violence because it’s a bargaining chip.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Time’s up.   

STEVEN A. COOK 
So thus the lives of innocents is a bargaining chip, it’s a political 

power player on the part of Hamas.  They will continue their 

terrorism, thank you.  I urge you to vote For.  Oh you’ve already 

voted, so thanks for your vote.   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Against the motion, Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou.  

MAHMOUD OULD MOHAMEDOU 
Thank you very much.  Well I had a bit of an uplifting argument 

to finish with but I guess that unfortunately we’ve moved from 

intelligent debate to acuteness, apparently winning it.  And it’s a 

pity because the whole debate was not necessarily about this pro-

Israeli or pro-Arab or pro-Palestinian.  It’s really something 

different.  It was about justice, people fighting for justice are not 

terrorists, it’s about international legality, wars of national

liberation are not terrorism.  And it’s about the cogency of our 

moral principles.  But it seems that all of this uh, sort of um, 

again acuteness that was adopted to address these life and death 

matters seems to have won the room and you know, fine.  But 

again back to Stanley’s point, history marches on.  Um and 

although one might think that there’s something inevitable about 

the Arab, Israeli conflict, I for one would like to believe that it’s 

not.  Imagine if the EU were to call a Hamas delegation or have an 

adult conversation with them.  Imagine if the Secretary of State 

were to address elected officials and, and invite them and discuss 

with them.  Imagine if the Israeli population elected a government 

from which they asked and then to implement policies and 

negotiations with whomever is in charge.  This I think would quell 

the violent, violence on both sides, resuscitate the peace talks, 

and get us into a new dynamic.  You don’t have to imagine the 

opposite situation.  We’re in it and we’ll continue to be in it as 

long as motions such as tonight, such as tonight’s will continue 

to let it.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Okay.  For the motion, John O’Sullivan.  

JOHN O’SULLIVAN 
Well I'm delighted that there are distinguished psychiatrists, 

doctors, lawyers and so on in Hamas, and at the moment 

Radovan Karadzic is on the run from NATO as a war criminal.  He

himself was a child psychiatrist before the war started.  I wonder 

what became of his charges.  It’s unusual for me to find myself as 

the idealist on the platform, but I point out that the argument 

that we should be having as well as the particular argument 

about the Middle East is an argument about violence in politics.  

When violence enters politics, it’s very hard to drive it out again.  

And when indiscriminate violence against innocent people enters, 

it damages the society very strongly indeed.  Now that’s not the 

only way to have a revolution.  Polish solidarity won 

independence from Russia.  And that has been repeated in 

Georgia and in the Ukraine and elsewhere by a campaign of moral 

resistance and cultural resistance that wore down the opposition 

and persuaded people to come over to it.  That’s the, that’s the 

kind of revolution if the, if one is needed.  That’s the kind of 

revolution, recourse that we should encourage people to pursue.  

We should not turn a blind eye to their crimes because they have 

managed to be elected.  It’s a fine thing to be elected, but it 

doesn’t absolve you from the laws of human conduct that the rest 

of us are supposed to obey.  [APPLAUSE]  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
And our final argument against, Mark Perry.   

MARK PERRY 
We won't be here two years from now, two years from now 

debating this question because by two years from now this, this 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 65. 

 
 
 

debate will be resolved.  Why?  Because Israel will be talking to 

Hamas, that’s why.  Because they’re talking to them right now.  

How do we know that?  Because there is a proposed cease-fire in 

Gaza in which Khaled Meshaal traveled to Cairo and Ehud Olmert 

said, if you can stop those rockets, we’ll withdraw from Gaza.  

Now that might not be eyeball to eyeball talk but that’s a political 

understanding.  And how did that happen?  It happened because 

George Bush was going to Amman, Jordan and Dick Cheney is 

going to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to talk to those guys about helping 

us out in Iraq and they’re looking at him and saying how are we 

going to do that when our own people are making a clamor about 

the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?  And so George Bush and Dick 

Cheney are picking up the phone and calling Prime Minister 

Olmert and he’s saying, what?  I can’t, they’re a terrorist 

organization.  George Bush is going to go, oh come on.  Where do 

you think this is?  Grow up, be adults.  We’ve got a world to run.  

You want to run it?  Talk to people, talk to them.  They might be a 

terrorist organization, yes they’ve killed civilians, yes it’s a terrible 

thing.  After World War II, we went into Germany and put three 

hundred and thirty-four people on trial and called it a day.  Why?  

Because we have to go forward, and it’s time to go forward.  It’s 

time to go forward, thank you.  [APPLAUSE]   

JUDY WOODRUFF  
And our final debater for the motion, Ambassador Daniel Ayalon.

DANIEL AYALON 
Yes.   Thank you, well what was the issue today?  The issue was 

of little moral and practical nature.  Legally, are they law 

offenders?  They have illegal arms, they breached the law, yes, 

Hamas does.  Moral issue.  Are they killers of children and other 

innocent people, yes they are.  And of practical issue, just a 

matter of common sense, is there any sense talking to them?  Will 

talking to them bring peace and quiet?  Well I don't think so.  

Now we have to make sure the equation is right, and it’s not that 

they will say well we will stop killing you if you give us land, if you 

give us political concession.  This is not the equation.  If they stop 

killing us, we will stop hunting them.  When they are ready for 

political concessions, we will give them political concessions.  It’s 

apple to apple, oranges to oranges.  This is the issue and so long 

as the Palestinians and Hamas especially, deny recognition of 

Israel’s right to be there in their homeland, there’s not going to 

peace, to be peace.  And the fact that they continued with this uh, 

terror, and some would call it resistance is also a fallacy because 

it’s not resistance.  Israel is ready to uh, to build a Palestinian 

state.  Israel was withdrawing from territories, the entire area of 

Gaza, areas of the West Bank.  And we are willing to talk.  What, 

what are we going to talk about?  The road map to peace, how to 

make peace, how to create a Palestinian state which will live side 

by side with a Jewish Israel.  This is at stake now, and so long as 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 
PROGRAM Rosenkranz Foundation, A democratically-elected Hamas...  Page 67. 

 
 
 

the Palestinians do not want to do that, as long as they keep the 

killing, there’s nothing to talk about.  They stop the killing, then 

we talk.  [APPLAUSE]  

JUDY WOODRUFF  
Alright, I want to thank all of our debaters, I want to thank all of 

you in the audience for your excellent questions and your good 

behavior.  It’s time now to announce the results of the voting after 

our debaters did the very best job they could to sway you.  Here’s 

the number that we have.  A hundred and fifty-nine voted for the 

motion, one hundred voted against which is a, almost a doubling 

of what it was before.  And fifty-two said I don't know.  So again, 

a hundred and fifty-nine for, a hundred, that means that a 

number of you didn’t vote when you first came in.  That’s, it, it 

looks as if we’ve got forty-nine, fifty, fifty or so more people who 

voted uh, at the end.  Uh, but again we appreciate the 

participation of all of our debaters, we thank you in the audience, 

I want to invite you to return next month for the fourth 

Intelligence Squared US debate on Wednesday, December 13th 

here at the Asia Society and Museum.  The motion to be debated 

is Hollywood has promoted anti-Americanism abroad.  We have
