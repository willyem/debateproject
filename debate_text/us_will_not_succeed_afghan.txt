 JOHN DONVAN 

Ladies and gentlemen, we are about one minute away from 

beginning.  For people who have just arrived, I want to say once 

again your voting pad is on the left arm of your chair, and I would 

like to remind everyone to turn off their cell phones now so that it 

doesn’t interfere with the broadcast on Bloomberg and on NPR, and 

at this point I’d like to welcome our debaters to the stage.  

[APPLAUSE]  At this point I would like to introduce the CEO of 

Intelligence Squared US, Mr. Robert Rosenkranz.   

[APPLAUSE]   

 ROBERT ROSENKRANZ 

Well, thank you all very much for being here, this is certainly a very

timely event as the nation considers what to do about sending 

additional troops to Afghanistan and defining our strategy there.   

When we framed this debate and it’s my job tonight to explain why 

we chose it as a topic, we felt that the semantics of the debate 

might be of particular interest, we’re calling this, “America Cannot 

and Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan-Pakistan.”   Our definition 

would’ve been, of success, would have been, first of all, to prevent 

Pakistani nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of extremists 

like the Taliban.   And second to impede as much as possible, the 

ability of al-Qaeda to operate and project its terrorist objectives 

outside of the region.  We really didn’t intend this debate to be 

about nation-building Afghanistan, but, the policy debate raging in 

Washington these days as we speak, does seem to conflate the 

Taliban and al-Qaeda.   And it pretty much defines success as 

creating a reasonably stable, reasonably democratic and reasonably 

strong government in Afghanistan.   So, given that, I think we’re 

going to learn a great deal this evening about, first of all about 

Afghanistan’s primitive economy, dominated by heroin production, 

about the ungoverned tribal areas that stretch from Pakistan to 

Afghanistan.  About the divided loyalties of the Pakistani militaries 

and intelligence services.  About the role of the Saudis in promoting 

Wahhabism, and about alternative counterinsurgency strategies.   

In short, this is a dauntingly complex mosaic.  And at the end of 

the evening, where you vote may well turn on which side’s

definition of success you choose to embrace.  And with that I’d like 

to turn the evening over to John Donvan and the extraordinarily 

able group of panelists that we’ve assembled this evening.  Thank 

you.   

[APPLAUSE, LOW VOICES]   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, what I always like to do at this point is ask everyone for 

one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz who makes this 

all possible.  [APPLAUSE]   Hello, everyone, and welcome to another 

debate from Intelligence Squared US, I’m John Donvan and once 

again, it is my honor to be acting as moderator as the six debaters 

you see here on the stage with me at the Skirball Center for the 

Performing Arts at New York University, will be debating this 

motion, “America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and 

Pakistan.”   And what debate topic could be more timely at this 

point for a contest like this, and that’s what this is, this is a 

contest, a competition of ideas, there will be winners and losers and 

while I am the referee, you, our live audience here at the Skirball 

Center are our judges.   By the time this debate has finished, you 

will have been asked to vote twice, once before, and once again at 

the end, registering whether you agree or disagree with the motion.  

At the end of the debate, the team that has changed the most 

minds will be declared our winner.   So let’s take 30 seconds and 

reach for those keypads by your seats, and it is time to vote, at this

point, on our motion, “America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in 

Afghanistan and Pakistan.”  If you agree push number “1,” if you 

disagree, it’s number “2”…and if you are undecided, push number 

“3.”   If you feel you’ve made a mistake…just push the correct

one.  [PAUSE]  All right.  And so to the debate.   Round 1, opening 

statements by each debater in turn, seven minutes each, and these 

are without interruption, and our first debater for the motion, 

Patrick Lang who is a retired US military officer, and a former 

Green Beret.  He’ll be taking the microphone first to argue for our 

motion, “America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and 

Pakistan,” ladies and gentlemen, Patrick Lang.   

[APPLAUSE]   

 PATRICK LANG  

Well ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great pleasure to be here with you, 

this is a fascinating topic at this particular moment in American 

history.  And I would’ve thought maybe that people were tired of it 

by now but I can see that that is obviously not the case.  Now as 

the chairman said, in fact I don’t think this— you can decide that 

question other than in the context of what it—whether or not you’re 

going to succeed, other than in the context of what American policy 

is and what the stated foreign policy of the President of the United 

States is with regard to this question.   That’s—  I had the fortune 

or misfortune to go to any number of Army service schools, one of

them was the Army War College, where they taught me a lot about 

the strategy of planning… itself, you started with the mission,  

national purpose, you have a policy, and then you devise a strategy 

from that. then you implement that strategy.  That’s how it works.  

Now, last March I listened carefully when President Obama 

announced that our policy in Afghanistan was to disrupt, destroy, 

and disorganize our enemies, our specific enemies who were a 

danger to the United States.  That’s a nice… clear policy, you know, 

it’s not too hard to understand that.   And to that end, General 

Stanley McChrystal was put in command out there, and sent out to 

make what is called a commander’s estimate of the situation.  

Which he did, with a lot of help from various people for several 

months and it is now as you know, the object of great contention in 

the Washington world.  And the problem with his estimate, I think, 

that is causing so much trouble, is that it is normal in an estimate 

of that kind for a commander to propose several options to his 

superior, among which the boss can choose.  To present only one 

option, in this case the option of a large-scale counterinsurgency 

campaign, across all of the really hostile parts of Afghanistan in the 

context of their ruined, if ever alive economy, and their obviously 

rather feeble political system, is a daunting task.   But somehow it 

has become-- what we would call an implied task for General 

McChrystal, that the pacification of large parts of Afghanistan and 

the most hostile places are in fact a necessary thing.   And for that

reason, he has opted for counterinsurgency.  Now, I am happy to 

see so many members of my generation out here in the audience.  

There are usually too many young people for my taste.  

[LAUGHTER]    But—  I started in the counterinsurgency business 

—in the church of the counterinsurgents, really.  In 1964, if you 

can believe that, when the Army sent me down to Fort Bragg to 

study this subject with intensity and at the feet of the most learned 

French and British exponents of this theory of warfare which had 

been created as a result of the experience of the former colonial 

powers in World War II in fighting against the wars of national 

liberation as they were called then.   And the Communists had 

gotten involved in all these wars so we were against all this as well, 

so we studied up on this in a big way, and one of the most 

interesting of the guys who taught from the stage there was a great, 

a great scholar named Bernard Fall.  Bernard Fall.   Some of you 

undoubtedly know who that is.  And I remember watching him, I—

of course I had no real idea who he was at the time but I remember 

him, watching him write—write on a blackboard on the stage, 

“Counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic 

development plus counter-guerilla operations.”  

“Counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic 

development plus counter-guerilla operations.”   And that’s really 

all of it right there, that’s all of it in a nutshell.  And it is in that 

context that when you look at Afghanistan, this huge place that’s

the size of Texas with 35 million people of very disparate origins, 

many of them speaking languages that are not mutually intelligible,  

and who don’t like each other, a lot of them, very much, in fact you 

can see, that this is a very difficult thing to do.  We tried applying 

this theory of warfare, counterinsurgency, across the world in the 

1960s and ‘70s and ‘80s and I did it myself in South America, in 

East Africa and Southwest Asia and all kinds of places, and of 

course Vietnam, how could I forget that.  And we found that in 

places where the task wasn’t too big, you know, the country wasn’t 

too big, the problems weren’t manageable one way or another, or 

people weren’t thoroughly converted to some ideology that 

demanded revolution, that you could do this, by enough good 

works and suppression of guerillas you could turn this around, and 

I could name places if we had time.  In places that were eerily big 

and where none of those conditions applied, we—you could struggle 

like the devil but you wouldn’t get very far, you know.   And I—this 

is the problem I have with the idea of the application of 

counterinsurgency, those three things, to Afghanistan, I know that 

was four things.  In fact, I think that is too big a task for us.  We 

have been fighting for eight years, Afghanistan is a huge place, it 

has terrible problems, economic ones, political ones.   And the 

combat problem, from the point of view of a guy who fought in 

several wars like this including Vietnam, is really very difficult.  

And I would submit to you that if what we’re going to do as General 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and 

                                            Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan” (10/6/09) Page 8. 

 

 

 

McChrystal says, we’re going to try to protect the people, which 

means essentially, control the population because that’s what 

counterinsurgency is about,  just like insurgency is about 

controlling the population either with positive means, or means not 

so positive, sometimes, you’re going to have to have a lotta troops 

to do this.  I mean General McChrystal evidently wants 40,000 

more people.   Well I would say to you that that’s just the 

beginning.  That’s how we started in Vietnam too.  This is a big 

problem we’re facing in Afghanistan.  And in fact, this slice of the 

pie will be followed by further slices of the pie.   And my objection 

to all this is, and the reason why I don’t think we can win with a 

counterinsurgency strategy, is in fact because I think that, three or 

four years down the pike, if we apply that strategy, all you good 

people, and your fellow citizens across the country are going to look 

at this, going to say, are the Taliban, or whatever it is we’re calling 

the Taliban, are they really our enemies, in the sense that al-Qaeda 

was?  Is this really what we want to do?  And when that happens, I 

suspect that what’s going to happen is you’re going to tell your 

members of Congress that you’ve had enough of this, and then they 

will vote the end of the war as they did in Vietnam.   So I don’t 

think we can do this, I don’t think we can do counterinsurgency in 

Afghanistan, there are other methods that could be applied, that 

would control the situation there over a long period of time, I don’t 

think we can withdraw altogether.  But counterinsurgency in

Afghanistan I find to be a very difficult idea.  Thank you very much.

And now the counterpunch, Steve Coll is CEO of the New America 

Foundation and his book which I’ll bet a lot of people in this hall 

have read, Ghost Wars, is a winner of a Pulitzer Prize, arguing 

against the motion that “America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in 

Afghanistan and Pakistan,” Steve Coll.   

 STEVE COLL 

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you all very much, thanks for 

coming out, I’m very pleased to share the stage with my friend and 

colleague Steve Clemons.  To give you a little taste of hallway life at 

New America Foundation, I notice a few of my friends and many of 

his friends but I’m trying to suppress my concern that this is going 

to turn out like an Afghan election.  Um…  [LAUGHTER]  So the 

question before us is whether the United States can or will succeed 

in Afghanistan and Pakistan and I thought the chairman said it 

well, this is obviously an elastic question that depends on your 

definition of success.   So let me offer my own.  That US policy 

contributes to the persistence of an Afghan government that is not 

forcibly ruled by the Taliban, and a Pakistan that does not 

completely fail as a state, or fall into the hands of Islamic 

extremists.  Well by that definition, which captures the bare 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and 

                                            Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan” (10/6/09) Page 10. 

 

 

 

minimum of US interests at issue in the war, I think the answer is 

obvious, you can construct such a policy.  Whether or not we will is 

another question I’m sure we’ll talk about, but we certainly can.  

There are two basic reasons, one is that there is still time to define 

our goals more modestly and allocate our resources more 

realistically.   And the second is that the situation in Afghanistan 

and the surrounding region is not as dire as many of you may fear.  

So I want to concentrate my time now on the second argument 

because it’s the less familiar one.  I hope there are some Afghans in 

the audience.   They can tell you better than I that we as Americans 

diminish ourselves and—when we talk about Afghanistan as we too 

often do as a primitive land of savage tribes that has been at war 

for centuries.  Afghanistan between the late 18th century and 1979 

was a coherent and mainly peaceful independent state.  Although 

very poor, after the 1920s it enjoyed a long period of continuous 

peace with its neighbors, secured by a multi-ethnic Afghan national 

army and unified by a national culture.  That state and that culture 

were badly damaged, almost destroyed, by the wars ignited by the 

Soviet invasion of 1979, wars to which we in the United States 

contributed disruptively.  Yet after 2001 Afghans returned to their 

country from refugee camps, and far-flung exile to reclaim their 

state.  Not to invent a brand new western-designed democracy, but 

to reclaim their own peaceful decentralized, but nonetheless unified 

and even modernizing state.  Despite the manifold errors of US

policy during the Bush administration, a strong plurality of Afghans 

still want to finish that work.  And they want the international 

community to stay, to correct its errors, and to help them reclaim 

their country.   After three decades of continuous violence most 

Afghans are sick of war, and afraid of the Taliban’s return.  We 

have an obligation and a national interest and we certainly have the 

capacity to stand by them.    About three times as many Afghans 

today still have a more favorable view of international forces in their 

country than they do of the Taliban.  Millions of Afghans risked 

their lives to vote in the recent Presidential election.  American, 

international and Afghan government failures have certainly 

handed the Taliban momentum.  But the Taliban are hardly 

unstoppable, or even as successful as many Americans today 

apparently believe.  Today we regard Iraq for example as passively 

stable.   Yet the per capita rate of violent death in Iraq today is four 

times greater than the similar rate in Afghanistan.  At the peak of 

Iraq’s war it was 20 times greater.  We’ve heard much anxiety about 

the allegations of fraud in the recent Presidential election and for 

good reason.   Fractured politics, corruption and weak leadership 

present some of the most important challenges to US policy in 

Afghanistan and Pakistan alike.  These challenges do argue for a 

new strategy that places much greater emphasis on political 

approaches, than on violent military action.  But consider what has 

not happened since the Afghan Presidential vote.  No opposition

protesters have taken to the streets, not a single rock has been 

thrown through a single window.    The opposition leader has 

spoken freely and offered pointed criticism of the sitting—sitting 

President, but he’s done so within the constitutional system.  In 

Kenya a couple of years ago the incumbent President stole his 

reelection and the entire country burned down.  The Afghan 

response to similar evidence of fraud has been entirely pragmatic.  

The great majority of Afghans continue to show they want security 

and normalcy, they’re willing to talk their way through this crisis, 

we should get ourselves organized and help them.  Finally we can 

succeed at this course correction because we do not have to do it 

all ourselves.   Our presence in Afghanistan is entirely legitimate, 

under international law the United States is—the United Nations is 

present, every government in the region other than Iran’s wants us 

to stay.  Russia is supporting our supply lines, China wants a 

stable Afghanistan, India’s Prime Minister has announced his 

intention to seek a transformational peace with Pakistan.  Some of 

our allies it’s true, including Russia and Pakistan, are sullen and 

ambivalent.   But unlike in Vietnam or Iraq, this neighborhood is 

united in its desire for stability and security.  And it’s united also in 

the conviction that American persistence in Afghanistan, corrected 

and recalibrate, is required.  The ultimate exit strategy for the 

United States from South Asia is Pakistan’s success.  This is not 

assured but the prospects are improving.  Pakistani public opinion

has now turned sharply against the Taliban and al-Qaeda.  The 

best way for the United States to support this momentum is to stay 

in Afghanistan, stabilize that country, marginalize the Taliban 

through population security and negotiations, and broaden and 

deepen its engagements in Pakistan.   The best way to assure the 

failure of Pakistan on the other hand, a state with scores of nuclear 

weapons, would be to allow the Taliban to return to power in 

Afghanistan, or to conduct a narrow war of terrorism that takes no 

account of the aspirations or long-term security of the Afghan or 

Pakistani people.   I’m astonished when I hear American leaders 

advocate a counterterrorism war that amounts to an indefinite 

campaign of remote-controlled assassinations by flying robots.  

This is hardly the face of America that we should be emphasizing.   

Our record in Afghanistan and Pakistan should humble all of us.  It 

should bring humility to the way we define our goals and realism 

about the means that we—that are required to actually achieve 

them.   It should lead us to choose political approaches over kinetic 

military ones, urban population security over provocative rural 

patrolling, and Afghan and Pakistani solutions over American 

blueprints.   But it should not lead us to defeatism or to 

acquiescence in a violent Taliban takeover of either Afghanistan or 

Pakistan.  We have the means to prevent that, and it is in our 

interest to do so.  Thank you.

Thank you, Steve Coll, and our next debater, Steve Clemons, also 

works at the New America Foundation so this is the first time we’ve 

had a debater, debating with his boss.  [LAUGHTER]  And we’ll see 

how that goes.  Steve Clemons is also the publisher of the political 

blog The Washington Note, and he is arguing for the motion, 

“America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and 

Pakistan,” ladies and gentlemen, Steve Clemons.   

[APPLAUSE]  

 STEVE CLEMONS 

Thanks—  Thank you, while I have a chance to pay tribute to my 

boss and colleague, Steve Coll, on the blogging front, Steve writes 

the blog “Think Tank” for The New Yorker, you should go check it 

out, I hope Steve writes about this.  Steve was commended the 

other day by Senator John McCain at a forum in Washington.   

John McCain said to everyone go read Ghost Wars, and as it turns 

out Barack Obama’s been carrying a text of Ghost Wars around for 

about 11 months.  I think it’s the most carried-around book that 

Obama has had, if he would just finish it we might get somewhere.  

[LAUGHTER]   I also want to take a moment to pay tribute to Kati 

Marton who’s a member of our board of directors and happens to 

be married to one Richard Holbrooke.  Richard Holbrooke is in my 

view one of the most tenacious and effective results-deliverers in 

the global justice community.  I put myself somewhat in the realist

community, but I don’t—I generally criticize some of the goals of the 

global justice community, for not being able to set priorities, not 

being able to set plans, not being able to pursue things to their end.    

And Richard Holbrooke does do this.  My problem, and why I’m on 

this side of the aisle from my friend and colleague Steve Coll, is that 

very few people in the Obama administration are like Richard 

Holbrooke, or can frame the debate in Pakistan and Afghanistan 

like Steve Coll just did.  And this concerns me.  If you speak to 

people of responsibility within an administration, clarity of 

objectives and how you’re going to get there, the game plan, being 

not only able to explain to the American public why we’re doing 

something, but to be able to create internal plans that help you 

execute consistent direction is vital.   And that clarity of direction 

has not been in place and it wasn’t until the leak of General 

McChrystal’s report, in my view, that you began to see higher 

prioritization of the Afghanistan question.  That is a lousy way to 

tell the world that we’re under good management in the United 

States.   A few years ago I was in China.  I went to see the 

equivalent of the policy planning staff in China, said what are you 

folks working on.  And they said how to keep you guys distracted in 

small Middle Eastern countries.  [LAUGHTER]   And as we’ve 

moved from the problems in Iraq, we now have moved to a problem 

in South Asia, and very often we talk about as Steve Coll did, the 

drama that envelops the South Asian region, the very important

promise the United States has in possibly trying to achieve a new 

equilibrium there.   But let me ask you all a question, how many of 

you look at China, whether you’re concerned about its security 

forces or indebtedness, as a major issue for the United States, just 

raise your quick hand.   Okay, how— hands down.  How many of 

you look at in the Middle East, what is unfolding with Iran, Iran’s 

nuclear intentions, as a significant, really giant hurdle for the 

United States.   How many of you look at Russia, some of you look 

at Russia and what’s been unfolding in NATO as a major issue.  

Probably a fewer number, but they’re out there.

I am seeing lots and lots of hands go up, lots of concern.  And let 

me tell you—  [LAUGHTER]  The issue, the issue here today, is one, 

whether the United States after eight years of failing to move the 

needle, in fact seeing the needle come back on itself very

objectives it sets out for itself.  I think Barack Obama has inherited 

one of the worst economic and national security portfolios of any 

President in American history.   We are not starting out at the same 

starting point that George Bush was starting out.  You’re starting 

out in major—in a major hole, in a major deficit.  And how we 

conduct our primary goals and objectives, has huge consequence 

on the way our allies see us, and whether they depend on us or not, 

and it also has consequences on our foes and their behaviors,  and 

I would argue today, that the equilibrium, the general equilibrium 

that the United States had around the world, has been broken, and 

the tectonics of global affairs have shifted around so dramatically, 

that as we find ourselves bogged down, into very large goals, which 

I think are commendable goals, but we’re not achieving them, we’re 

convincing Iran not to negotiate in a fair and honest way, we are 

convincing Russia to continue to move its objectives.  We are 

convincing China, that we’re increasingly a basket case.  We—

China would have to finance this war.  We’re paying $65 billion a 

year at current levels.  And that’s before the add-ons, just in 

military terms in Afghanistan today.  That does not include what 

our allies are spending militarily, nor does it include the non-

military expenditures.   Ladies and gentlemen, that number is 

bigger than the entire GDP of Afghanistan.  We could buy the whole 

place, we could put everyone to work.  We could do a Marshall Plan 

in the region for something very different.  My worry about a lot of

the steps that we’ve taken in Afghanistan is that we’re finding 

ourselves increasingly in a civil war, in which the Pasthun 

opposition which is the home base for the Taliban, actually sees us 

increasingly as occupiers and controllers, and I worry about our 

inability to disentangle that.  Now there are others who have 

written, and Les Gelb did so recently in a Daily Beast article, Les 

Gelb the former, well-respected head of the Council on Foreign 

Relations, said it’s time for the United States to find a way to turn 

this not just into a NATO war, and an American war, but an Afghan 

war with other stakeholders.   Particularly countries like Russia 

and China and other stakeholders in the region where they can 

come in, and actually feel as if this matters to them too.  That the 

instability there is happening, we are right now back into, while we 

have allies, back into a sense that this is our game.  And we have 

some slightly reluctant fellow travelers from NATO helping us, and 

we’re achieving none of the big, progressive goals that I think that 

we should be able to.   And so as we look at this, we look at the 

cost and we look at how we’re operating in Afghanistan, I think it’s 

very important to look at the consequences on US society and what 

it’s achieved elsewhere in the world.  Jim Jones, President Obama’s 

national security advisor, just said, that we have succeeded in 

diminishing al-Qaeda’s resonance and its robustness, both in 

Pakistan and Afghanistan, and he said, that there is no imminent 

threat of a Taliban takeover.   Now, this is quite different than

General McChrystal’s report and I have to say, that General 

McChrystal has probably written in my personal view, one of the 

most stark and realistic and probably accurate assessments of the 

mess in Afghanistan today.   I disagree with the prescription 

because I don’t have confidence and faith in the ability of the 

Presidential leadership to get this right.  My colleagues on the other 

aisle, are going to argue that it can.  But, at some point you have to 

pull the plug, and say that it is time that we begin to move in a 

different direction.  We need a consistent voice, consistent 

leadership, that is not happening.  Thank you very much.

So a reminder of where we are, we’re halfway through  the opening 

round of this Intelligence Squared US debate, I’m John Donvan, we 

have six debaters, two teams of three who are debating this motion, 

“America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and 

Pakistan.”   Our fourth speaker now, against the motion, John Nagl 

who is president of the Center for New American Security, he is a 

West Point graduate, he is a Rhodes scholar, he served in Iraq,

Thank you, it’s a great pleasure to be here tonight to argue about a

subject that I think should concern us all and I’m very pleased that 

the American people are so closely engaged in this discussion that 

concerns the safety of the country, the safety of all of us, as well as 

the fates of many of my friends and I’m sure many of your sons and 

daughters and friends as well, so, it is well worth the time to invest 

in thinking hard about these questions and what it is we’re trying 

to accomplish in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Steve focused on why 

it is that we should succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and 

talked to a certain extent about why it is possible for us to do so, 

that the situation is not as dire as perhaps has been presented.   It 

is my task then to talk about part of the way we can succeed, part 

of the how.  And I’d like to start off if I can by pointing out that, 

there has been an acceptance so far in this debate of what it is 

we’re trying to accomplish, of what success means.  And success 

has been defined as a pretty minimal standard.  An Afghanistan 

and a Pakistan that are not ruled by terrorists, a Pakistan that still 

has security over its nuclear arsenal.  I would contend, that if we 

cannot as a nation achieve that success, if it is impossible for the 

United States to ensure that Pakistan retains control of its nuclear 

weapons from terrorists…that that is a very, very dire situation.   

And that’s why we have invested so much as a nation to date, and 

why I believe we need to invest even more, because the stakes are 

so very high, the consequences of failure are potentially so 

catastrophic.  That’s the bad news.   The good news is that we can

in fact succeed in this endeavor.  And this book tells us how.  This 

is the Counterinsurgency Field Manual written under the direction of 

General Petraeus and General Jim Mattis.   For those of you who 

didn’t bring it along, I’m [LAUGHTER] not going to read the whole 

thing.  But to quote from Chapter 5… the way to conduct a 

counterinsurgency campaign is to do a number of different things, 

to do them all well, to coordinate them together.   Our opponents 

say that it is impossible for the United States to help our friends 

and our allies do this, I would disagree, I would say that it is 

enormously difficult, but that we have a learning army, a learning 

State Department, we have adapted and we have developed the 

capability to do this reasonably well.   We have a number of 

extraordinarily talented people, continuing to try to help our Afghan 

partners.  And they do it by conducting combat operations against 

our enemies.   This is a component of counterinsurgency, this is 

the counterterrorism part, killing or capturing identified enemies of 

the government of Pakistan, the government of Afghanistan, and 

that happens and that will continue to happen, and we are in fact, 

getting far better at that.   Training and equipping host nation 

security forces is an essential part of a lasting counterinsurgency 

strategy, and it is essential for us not to have to conduct 

counterterrorism forever.  So, if you want at some point the United 

States to be able to depart from Afghanistan, then you have to 

support raising and training Afghan security forces who in time,

will be able to secure their country on their own, something we 

have not done very well to date.  We have to provide essential 

services to the population, water, electricity, most of all security.  

We have to provide them with good governance, something that, we 

have not helped with as much as we should.  We have to provide 

them with good economic development and opportunity to have 

their sons and their daughters earn a decent living, so that they 

cannot be attracted away by the insurgents, many of the insurgents 

I fought against in Iraq in 2003 and 2004, many of the Taliban 

insurgents today, are economic insurgents.  That is, there is no 

other way for them to feed their families, than to take money from 

the Taliban, in order to conduct attacks against us, against the 

governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan.   So, for a very few 

dollars, well-invested, we can peel away the less committed parts of 

the insurgency, and we can provide them with an economic 

opportunity.  We were able to do this in al-Anbar late in Iraq.   The 

process started early but really came to fruition in late 2006, early 

2007, and large numbers of the insurgents turned away from 

fighting against us, and started fighting on our side against al-

Qaeda.  We’ve done this before, the same people who made that 

process happen, who inspired that process in Iraq, are working now 

to do it in Afghanistan.   So you can peel away insurgents and 

reduce the number of people you’re fighting, gain additional 

support for your effort.  So we have done this successfully in the

past, it is not easy by any means, but we have a track record.  It is 

also important to note that Pakistan is now succeeding in its 

efforts.  In March the Pakistani government decided because of 

extraordinary American pressure, to fight against the insurgents 

who had taken the Swat River Valley, just 60 miles from the capitol 

of Pakistan.   And in a not very sophisticated but very effective 

counterinsurgency strategy, they cleared the Taliban out of the 

Swat River Valley, and the people of the Swat River are now 

returning home.  Pakistan is about to do the same thing in south 

Waziristan.  They are conducting an effective counterinsurgency 

campaign to relieve the danger to their government, and to make 

their weapons, and, and, and their country more safe.  The most 

important thing we can do to help them in this effort, is to continue 

to conduct counterinsurgency on our side of the Durand line in 

Afghanistan.   It will be enormously difficult for us to encourage 

Pakistan to continue conducting its counterinsurgency campaign, if 

we decide not to do so in Afghanistan.  And the implications of that 

decision are enormously important.   The single most important 

step we have to take, to build a secure Afghanistan and a secure 

region, is to raise and train an Afghan army that is sufficiently 

sized, and sufficiently well-equipped, to secure Afghanistan on its 

own.   In my last job on active duty in the Army, I worked with 

Afghan soldiers, I trained Afghan soldiers.  These are people who 

are willing to fight for their country.  They are disappointed that we

have not provided the resources to get enough of them to fight for 

their country, in order to enable us to begin to depart.   Putting 

more effort into that, is the single most important step I believe, to 

helping America succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Thank you.

The next counterpunch from Ralph Peters, he is a former US Army 

lieutenant-colonel, he is a writer, he’s also a novelist, his most 

recent novel just came out, it is called The War After Armageddon.  

It is an act of imagination, but he also writes about the current 

situation, writing in USA Today last February his assessment of 

Afghanistan:  We should smash our enemies and then leave.  It’s 

the fact that we did not leave, that explains why you are here to 

argue for the motion that “America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in 

Afghanistan and Pakistan,” Ralph Peters.    

 RALPH PETERS 

Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Looking out at this crowded house I’m 

really happy that I’m almost over my swine flu.   [LAUGHTER]  

Ladies and gentlemen.  So far this evening, you’ve heard quite a 

range of opinions.  Let’s look at the facts.  [GERMAN PHRASE]   We 

have been in Afghanistan for eight years.  We have committed 

enormous amounts of treasure and quite a bit of blood.  And eight 

years on, the Taliban have no trouble attracting volunteers…in fact 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

their numbers are swelling.   They are willing to take up primitive 

arms, and fight against the most powerful military in history, to 

stand with a Kalashnikov, or to attack a US outpost and stand and 

fight, despite the helicopters and the aircraft coming in on them, 

and killing them.   And we can’t get the Afghan army to show up.  

Eight years.  How much training does it take.   Sophisticated 

weapons?  What sophisticated weapons do the Taliban have.  

Bombs, rusty Kalashnikovs and grenade launchers.   The Taliban 

are willing to give their lives for their cause.  The Afghan army and 

police are not willing to die for the woefully corrupt and 

incompetent government of Hamid Karzai.  That is simply a fact.  

Now my Army colleague John Nagl said, well, the Taliban are 

hiring, they’re economic soldiers.   Ladies and gentlemen, you do 

not sign up to stand against the greatest army in history, and give 

your life, for the Afghan equivalent of a minimum wage.  And we 

pay better than the Taliban.  Why aren’t they lining up, to join the 

Afghan army and fight?  Why do our soldiers and Marines have to 

go into battle alone?  Or, worse, watching over their shoulder to see 

if the Afghans with them, are going to betray them or shoot them in 

the back, as has happened repeatedly.  This matters.  How many 

Americans should die for the government of Hamid Karzai?  And we 

can—and Steve Coll said, well, you know, we’re going to fix that.  

When, how?  Eight years.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the 

power to stay—and the wealth—to stay in Afghanistan forever.

Certainly beyond our lifetimes, if we wish.  But strategy is about 

asking what we get out of it.  And is it doable, strategy isn’t about 

what’s nice to do, it would be nice to turn Afghanistan into 

Vermont.  But it is not going to happen.   Because, one thing we 

cannot do— we can fly in in our helicopters, dismount, arrive in an 

Afghan village and get the elders to nod their heads, until we leave.  

We can bribe them for a while, they won’t stay bribed.  But we 

cannot make Afghans want what we want.   A brief history.  We’ve 

been in Afghanistan before.  We had major development projects, in 

Helmand Province, down where they’re fighting now, in the 1950s 

and ‘60s.  Nothing came of it.  The Soviets, had at their peak 

140,000 troops, tens of thousands civilian advisors.   Their 

interagency process worked because they could order people from 

other departments to go.  They have thousands of Dari and 

Pashtun speakers.  They built hundreds of clinics and schools and 

factories, it’s not like just the bad Soviets killing people in the 

movies.   Their Afghan army was over 300,000 trained with 

helicopters and tanks.  And they lost.  Because the people of 

Afghanistan didn’t want what the Soviets wanted them to want.  

Now think of this as an investment.  We’re investing our blood and 

treasure.   What is the possibility of a positive return, for that 

investment.  For the past 200 years, every foreign investor has lost.  

Are we truly exceptions to history?  Is it worth the gamble?  

Afghanistan is not a country, it is an accident of where other

people’s borders to ended.   You cannot nation-build where there is 

no nation to build.  In a tribal society, you work with tribes.  Now 

we may know that it would be wiser for all the tribes to get along.  

But we do not want what Afghans want.  General McChrystal’s 

report is fascinating.   In many respects it’s an objective view.  But 

you know what it leaves out.  Religion is barely mentioned.  In the 

Counterinsurgency Manual, religion is barely mentioned.  This is 

even more foolish than trying to deal with the war in Europe in 

World War II—and ignoring Nazis.   Religion may be politically 

incorrect to talk about.  It’s difficult, it makes us uneasy.  But to 

write a 66-page report about the Taliban, and not mention the 

power of religion and fundamentalist Islam, seems to me that we 

are living in a dream world.  Now.  This debate--  [APPLAUSE]  

Thank you.  This debate, the terms of it make me uncomfortable.  

Because I’m in the middle.  In a world of very strange bedfellows, I 

find myself aligning with Vice President Joe Biden, or, I’d like to 

think he’s aligning with me.  [LAUGHTER]   But the choices aren’t 

all in or all out.  There are rational choices.  Ladies and gentlemen, 

why did we go to Afghanistan in 2001?  Because of al-Qaeda.  To 

punish them, to smash them, and to punish those who harbored 

them.   Afghanistan was a low-budget terrorist motel.  So the feds 

raid the motel, kill some of the bad guys, capture some, and others 

escape.  And instead of going after the ones who escaped, we 

decided to renovate the motel.  [LAUGHTER]  It…  [APPLAUSE]

Now, I would just close by saying, I believe there is still a purpose 

in maintaining a compact, lethal force, focused on destroying our 

enemies, helping Pakistan to the extent Pakistan deserves the help, 

but not allowing ourselves to be blackmailed by the Pakistanis, as 

we have allowed ourselves to do.   But at the end of the day, this is 

about flesh and blood, Afghans of course, and our young men and 

women in uniform.  Now, I am not a pacifist.  Wars have to be 

fought.  But let us ensure that they are true wars of necessity, and 

not wars of inertia, and bad habits.   Let’s—when we ask our young 

men and women in uniform to die…if they must die, let it be for 

sensible strategy, and attainable goals.

 JAMES SHINN 

To convince you on your second vote, to support this motion, I 

think the other team has to convince you of either one of two 

propositions.  The first is, that we don’t have any serious interests 

in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and therefore we should walk away.   

Or, they have to convince that we do have interests in Afghanistan 

and Pakistan, but they’re too costly to achieve.  And therefore, we 

should walk away.  Although I just heard a new one from Steve 

Clemons who says, well, we may have interests, they may be costly 

but we can achieve them, but we should walk away perhaps 

because the President can’t make up his mind.  [PAUSE, 

MURMURS]   I think that Steve and John together have made a 

very persuasive case, for the interests that we have—we have, in 

Afghanistan and in Pakistan.  That these interests are not just 

America’s interests but these are shared by our allies.  And that we 

have the capacity, through the intelligent application of 

counterinsurgency doctrine, to achieve those.   And listen very 

closely to Ralph Peters’ argument, the smash them and leave 

argument, I believe, and to still vote for this proposition requires 

you to go through a kind of a contortion known as remote-control 

counterterrorism.   Remote-control counterterrorism, that’s where, 

presumably, you track and you deter al-Qaeda from offshore, 

maybe with precision munitions, maybe from satellites, maybe like 

that.  I think that’s a fundamentally flawed proposition, I would

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

submit to you.  And it’s flawed for a couple of reasons and let me 

share those with you.  With some realistic talk about how you 

actually have to deal with al-Qaeda.  Counterterrorism operations 

require two things, it requires intelligence, and it requires the 

ability to offensively strike against them.   You need to know where 

they are, what they’re up to, and you need to be able to strike at 

them.  There are only two sources of intelligence, if you’re tracking 

al-Qaeda folks up in the borderlands between Afghanistan and 

Pakistan.   And I’ve spent a good deal of the last two years, in those 

two countries.  One is by signals intelligence, where you try and 

track where they are by their cell phone.  Even as texting New 

Yorkers have found out that cell phones can be dangerous to your 

health, the al-Qaeda guys have gradually stopped revealing 

themselves by the same notion, which leaves you, really, relying 

upon human intelligence.  Spies, in other words.  We don’t have a 

lot of spies on the border areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan, 

the intelligence that we get about al-Qaeda and their fellow 

travelers compassed from the intelligence networks run by the 

Afghans, and the networks run by the Pakistanis.   If we walked 

away, why on earth would they share that intelligence with us.  

Let’s assume for the moment that you did have the intelligence 

about where a cell was who were planning another attack in New 

York or in a London subway.  How do you strike at them.  Right 

now the way we do it is with UAV Predators.  They have a flight

range of about 400 miles.  It’s 600 miles from Waziristan to the 

Indian Ocean.  Which leaves you the option maybe like the Clinton 

administration did in 1998, with launching a Cruise missile at 

them, but in the hours that it takes to target and launch a Cruise 

missile, the target’s probably gone, and worse, since it’s not 

accurate, you have a lot of collateral damage, a lot of dead civilians, 

and the cycle continues.   Fundamentally, to protect this national 

interest, that I believe even the other team agrees, to protect 

ourselves from terrorism, we need access, and cooperation, in 

Pakistan and in Afghanistan.  We don’t need Vermont.  We don’t 

need to stabilize the whole country, you don’t even need to engage 

in counterinsurgency activities across the whole landscape.  But 

you do need cooperation, you do need access, and this is about as 

stark a statement of national interest that I can think of.  Thank 

you.

undecided, and again we will ask you to vote at the end of the 

debate and the team that has moved the most votes, that has 

changed the most minds, will be declared our winner.   Now on to 

Round 2, this is our middle round where we mix things up a little 

bit now, our two teams get to debate head to head, and they will 

also be responding to questions from me, and questions from you.  

It’ll go on for about 40, 45 minutes.  And I want to start, by 

bringing something I heard from John Nagl over to Patrick Lang, 

Patrick Lang, you are a generation ahead of John Nagl, you’re both 

military men, you did counterinsurgency work, and you don’t seem 

to believe that the methods work very well and yet John Nagl comes 

in here,  he actually brings along the manual…with the techniques 

and the rules and tells us that we have seen it work, in Iraq.  Now, 

without turning this into a discussion about Iraq…tell me why 

John Nagl is wrong about success with counterintelligence, 

counterinsurgency measures.

 Well, to begin with, it was, I did appreciate the fact that sacred 

scripture was brought to the meeting here so it could be read to us.  

[LAUGHTER]  In fact these words inscribed in that manual are in 

fact the same doctrine that we used in the 1960s and ‘70s across 

the world.   And as I said, we had a varying pattern of success 

depending on how tough the opposition was and how long we were

willing to stick with it.   With regard to Iraq, with the greatest of 

respect to Colonel Nagl,  I would submit in fact that whatever it is 

that people call the surge, people are creating these fanciful 

concepts with single words as a public relations gimmick.  The 

surge, what was the surge, an increase of 30,000 troops or so, in 

Iraq for some period of time?  That was certainly useful in the 

Baghdad area in the context of Iraqi neighborhoods that had been 

largely cleansed ethnically or at least in a sectarian way, and then a 

lotta walls were built to separate these people, that worked very 

well indeed.   But I would submit to you that what really worked 

out in Anbar, in the places where he said-- in other places in Iraq--

was the fact that we adopted a very simple, old-fashioned tool that 

has been used in the Middle East from time immemorial and often 

by the colonial powers.    And that is in fact that we looked at our 

enemies and instead of believing that they were all one thing as had 

been advocated for three or four of the first years of the war, we 

actually looked at them and decided they were many different 

things.   And that some of these people were only, as it was said 

economic insurgents, and that they could be split off and used 

against the other ones.  And that had a devastating effect once it 

was put into effect against al-Qaeda—  

 JOHN NAGL 

 And why would that not work again in Afghanistan, Patrick.

 PATRICK LANG  

No, it would work.  That would work very well—   

 JOHN NAGL 

 It would work.  

 PATRICK LANG  

 Yeah, I actually think it would—I’m not in favor of withdrawing 

from Afghanistan.   

 JOHN NAGL 

Oh, heavens—   

 PATRICK LANG 

 But what I—what I’m not in favor of doing is trying to Vermontize 

large parts of Afghanistan.  I think that doesn’t suit—    

 JOHN DONVAN  

Did—did you say “Vermontize”—  [LAUGHTER]   

 PATRICK LANG 

I just created that word, yes.  Yeah—   

 JOHN NAGL 

 It’s a cheese thing.  [LAUGHTER]   

 PATRICK LANG 

Yeah, it’s a cheese thing.  Or a maple syrup thing, one or the other.  

And, but in fact—

 JOHN DONVAN 

 But to John’s point—   

 PATRICK LANG 

 So—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

—why would that not work in Afghanistan—   

 PATRICK LANG 

 I did say it would work—  

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Yeah—  

 PATRICK LANG 

 —it would work—   

 JOHN NAGL  

So Patrick, you would agree that America can succeed in 

Afghanistan and Pakistan—   

 PATRICK LANG 

 No, no, no, no, no, no, no—  [APPLAUSE]  No, it depends—depends 

on what you mean by succeed.  If you look at, in fact, what 

President Obama said was his purpose in Afghanistan in March,  

that was to disrupt and disorganize our enemies, our enemies, not 

the enemies of the Karzai government, or some other group of

political luminaries there, but our enemies in fact.  You can do that 

in exactly the same way it was done in Iraq because there are lots 

and lots of available, rentable Afghans out there.  And they’re—a lot 

of them do not belong to the Taliban confederation, some of the 

ones who do belong to the Taliban Confederation, can be split off, 

and their—   

 JOHN NAGL  

So we can use these techniques to achieve success in Afghanistan 

and Pakistan, prevent the Taliban and al-Qaeda from controlling 

those countries—   

 PATRICK LANG 

 I don’t really care who controls most of Afghanistan.  What I’m 

interested in doing is disrupting the people who might use 

Afghanistan as a base for planning offensive operations against the 

United States.  You have to stop thinking about improving the lot of 

the average Afghan, and start thinking about protecting these 

people here, and nothing else in fact—   

 JOHN NAGL 

And you believe it’s possible to do that.   

 PATRICK LANG 

 I—well, you may believe that it’s possible for us over a sustained 

period of time to spend vast amounts of money, have a couple 

hundred thousand troops in Afghanistan, and maintain in power a

government like Karzai’s power.  But I’m telling you, that what’ll 

happen here is that these folks will make a rational decision in 

several years if you do that, and they’ll tell their members of 

Congress let’s knock this stuff off.   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Steve Coll.   

 STEVE COLL  

That’s not what—that’s not actually what I think we’re all talking 

about, I mean when I listen to Ralph and you talk about sort of 

minimal goals and different means and a middle way and, there’s, 

this is not—neither of you is arguing for withdrawal.    

 PATRICK LANG  

 No.  We’re—I’m not.    

 STEVE COLL  

So, you’re talking about nuances of transition strategy.  What 

you’re really talking about is a plan, whether or not it is worth 

attempting to hold on to the Afghan state long enough to allow the 

Afghan national army to take the lead in the security of that state.  

Correct, I mean—   

 PATRICK LANG 

Yeah.

 STEVE COLL  

 —whether or not it’s, whether that investment—   

 RALPH PETERS  

Steve, Steve, for God’s sakes, eight years, when is the Afghan army 

going to show up?   

 STEVE COLL  

 Well, the Afghan army—   

 RALPH PETERS  

 80—how many more years, how many more years to—before the 

new Afghan army works—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Well let’s let him answer the question.   

 JOHN NAGL 

 Let—let me take that if I can.  So—  

 JOHN DONVAN 

 This is John Nagl.    

 JOHN NAGL 

Yeah, this is sort of what I do.   [LAUGHTER]  So, and Ralph, I took 

great exception to your statement that the Afghans are not fighting 

and dying because the Afghans currently lose, just the Afghan 

police, more than 100 are being killed every month by the Taliban.   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

So these guys are showing up for the fight.  And it is enormously 

disrespectful to say that they are not, it is enormously disrespectful 

to say that our European allies, who are also fighting and dying, 

Canadians, more Canadians proportionately have fallen in 

Afghanistan than Americans.   So there are a lot of people working 

to make this go.  [APPLAUSE]  First—   

 RALPH PETERS  

 John.  John.  John…the Afghan police are dying because they’re 

hiding in their police posts and the Taliban are surrounding them 

and killing them.  Our soldiers and Marines go out on patrol, and I 

talk to these guys, they are afraid of the Afghans betraying them, of 

shooting them in the back.   It’s happened again and again, they 

can’t get the Afghan army to fight except for a few commando units.   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 May I—   

 RALPH PETERS  

 You know, and there’s, there’s—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Steve Clem—let’s bring in your—   

 RALPH PETERS  

 —there’s a point at which—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

 JOHN DONVAN 

 —your fellow teammate—   

 RALPH PETERS  

 —you’ve gotta give—  

 JOHN DONVAN 

 —Steve Clemons.   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

A colleague of mine and Steve Coll’s, Peter Bergen, who would no 

doubt be arguing on the other side of the panel, made an 

interesting point the other day in that the tragic death of these I 

believe 10 troops that were killed in an external outpost—   The 

similar thing had been done in the past and there were hundreds of 

pages of review documents by the US military done to sort of 

prevent exactly what happened, that there was supposed to be pre-

positioning of men—of equipment and a concern that this not 

replay.   This gets at the issue I’ve been getting at, it is regardless of 

the merit of what you would like to try and achieve, the costs of the 

collective failure of the counterinsurgency approach of the months 

that have been under the Obama—  I mean the Obama 

administration came in in a period where, the concern for 

upgrading of the forces at that time was linked to the spring 

offensive.  Then there was the increase of 21,000 troops to make 

Afghans safe, Afghanistan safe for voters, and we needed to get

through the August 30th elections.  And then we see dire 

predictions of the meltdown of Afghanistan, again you—  We see a 

constant tick up, but no real serious competence in either 

generating a consistency of what objectives we’re at, whoever you 

talk to in the administration, if it’s DOD one day, State another 

USID on another, they’re not on the same page.  And then we have 

the tragic death of these soldiers, in something where the military 

had studied and not deployed the reforms it said it needed to do—  

 JOHN DONVAN 

 All right, let’s bring in—   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 It’s a mess.    

 JOHN DONVAN  

Let’s bring in James Shinn who’s already said he doesn’t really like 

your argument that the administration isn’t managing this thing 

well—    

 JAMES SHINN 

 Well, as a former member of the Bush administration I will allow 

you to take on the Obama guys as much as you like.   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 I would take on the Bush administration as well, they had seven 

years of this.  [APPLAUSE]

 JOHN DONVAN 

 James Shinn responding—   

 JAMES SHINN 

 But the issue is not whether it’s 20,000 troops or 10,000 more 

troops, it really is, and on this point I have to agree with the 

colonel, it’s a matter of time.  You’re interested in 

counterinsurgency, how long did it take to succeed in Malaysia?   

 PATRICK LANG 

 The British you mean?   

 JAMES SHINN 

The British.   

 PATRICK LANG 

 Yeah, it was a long time.   

 JAMES SHINN 

 Long time—   

 PATRICK LANG 

 And this is an interesting place too because you—   

 JAMES SHINN 

 12 years, and he did prevail, right?   

  



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and 

                                            Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan” (10/6/09) Page 43. 

 

 

 

 PATRICK LANG 

 They, they did prevail but you have to, you know [UNCLEAR] 

perfectly well that this was an occasion in which the number of 

Communist terrorists as they called them, was quite small, they 

were confined to a particular despised ethnic minority, and the 

conditions were all there to—all you had to do was hold on long 

enough and keep after them and you were going to get them.   But 

as I said before, this was a small-scale problem.  Afghanistan is not 

a small-scale problem in terms of applying a general 

counterinsurgency strategy to this place because it involves 

economic development, political reform, and counterguerrilla 

operations.  And those are all very complex things, and it’s going to 

be very expensive over a long period of time.    

 JAMES SHINN  

Well it is, it is big and it is complex and it will take time.  But the 

risk here I think, is that the counterinsurgency clock moves at a 

slower pace than the political clock.  The real question is, do we 

have the foresight or the strategy if you want to use Steve 

Clemons’s phrase, the strategic vision, to actually stay the course 

long enough so you achieve the objectives.  Or rather, you simply 

sacrifice your interests and walk away.    

 PATRICK LANG  

Yeah but this is a democracy, right?  I mean, at least we think it is 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

anyway.  And in fact, what’s going to happen here is, if you 

remember the history of the late, great war in Indochina, 40 years 

ago, after the application of a great deal of counterinsurgency effort 

in the last two or three years of the war, and in fact, and the 

Christmas bombing up at North Vietnam, there was an armistice 

that lasted for two years, you were there during that period, in fact.   

And in fact, there was—did not a thing happen until, the people of 

the United States over some hiccup in world events then, told their 

members of Congress that they wanted a law passed to prevent this 

happening again, and the Congress passed a law that said not 

under any circumstances would the United States ever assist South 

Vietnam again.  The other side, understandably understood that as 

a signal.  Right?  So, a year or so later or six months or whatever it 

was, they took their eight splendid divisions and they took a 

provincial capitol, and that was the end, everything fell apart.    

 JOHN NAGL  

So the question—  

 PATRICK LANG  

 Now why wouldn’t something like that happen again—  

 JOHN DONVAN 

 John, John Nagl.   

 JOHN NAGL  

So the question is not, whether the United States can succeed in

counterinsurgency, the question is whether we have sufficient 

national interests to necessitate that we bear the burden over the 

number of—

 No.

 No—

 —to do so—

 JOHN DONVAN  

Ralph Peters—   

 RALPH PETERS 

 —can the US succeed in counterinsurgency.  John…in that 

manual, you love to wave around, you did what bad academics do, 

you took a couple examples that supported your thesis, and 

ignored 3,000 years of history.  There is nothing in that manual 

about religious motivation and religious war.  And I will just tell

you.  We’re having a—we’re pretty comfortable in this auditorium 

tonight.  It’s easy to have this intellectual debate.  But it’s really to 

an extent a moot point because the Army and Marines are out of 

troops.   They are tired.  They are worn.  This isn’t an abstract 

issue.  In order to send 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan on what 

I believe is a fool’s errand…based upon history, we would have to 

send some troops directly from Iraq to Afghanistan.  Now we’ve 

been at this for eight years.   We’ve had some great successes in 

targeting al-Qaeda and smashing them.  We’ve—that makes sense 

in terms of our security.  But teaching better dental hygiene to 

Afghan villagers does not persuade the Arab terrorists in al-Qaeda 

to stop attacking America, and America’s interests, so John, no, I 

do not agree that we can succeed in counterinsurgency.  We are not 

necessarily better than the Brits, who had tried it for over 100 

years, or even the Soviets.   I need to see the proof that we can 

succeed, before send more—   

 JOHN NAGL  

 Ralph, I—

 —of our troops, to die for your theory.  [APPLAUSE]

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 —we—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Steve Clemons—   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 —I mean, binary debates, are always complicated but I hope we 

can stay away from sloganeering, I’m not there—the other day 

General David Patraeus said that one of his concerns, was that 

people would think that what happened in Iraq would be easily 

moved— that he thinks all the time about the tyranny of the mind, 

that one would get stuck in one framework that might not approach 

the others,  so General Petraeus actually raised many of the same 

questions that we are about the applicability of the 

counterintelligence—but let’s take your manual for a minute, your 

manual as you know, and I’ve learned a lot about it from you,  

argues for a forced deployment which is staggering, but more 

important, of that staggering force deployment it argues that of the 

resources deployed, 80 percent of those should be civilian, 20 

percent should be military.   And I have to tell you that everything 

we see percolating out of the military analysis is calling for a 

99.999 percent military approach to this.  That only animates 

Pashtun tribalism, Pashtun concern over occupation.   It animates 

and it has built a blob, which we’re increasingly calling the Taliban.

We’re not able to defuse that, and we’re not able to get the 

convertibility.  I’ve talked to various people that—   

 JAMES SHINN 

Steve, you obviously haven’t read…General McChrystal’s 

assessment.  Because he says right in there, that it’s as much 

politics and economics, that it is military.

 PATRICK LANG 

The-- he talks so much about the need for good governance in 

Afghanistan and about the woeful deficiencies of the present setup 

which is based really on traditional norms of government in 

Afghanistan and throughout the region in fact.  You know, then 

after a while you begin to wonder if he thinks in fact that Karzai is 

in fact reformable, or will have to be removed and replaced with 

somebody else.    

 JOHN DONVAN 

All right, I want to at this point go to the audience for some 

questions.  And we have people around the hall with microphones.  

And if you’re called on, I just want to urge you to hold the 

microphone about a fist away from your mouth so that we can hear 

you and the radio can hear you.   And while the microphones are 

getting out I just want to take one last question to Steve Coll, in 

that I heard from your opponents’ side early in the opening 

statements, the remark that in the case of Afghanistan there is no 

nation to build, and I want to ask you is that true and is that 

relevant.   

 STEVE COLL  

It’s false and it is relevant, it’s the heart of what I was trying to 

argue about Afghan partnership in this and the evidence, the clear 

evidence of Afghan resilience expressed continually despite our

errors and our underinvestment.   You know, to talk about the 

Afghan army not showing up is to suggest that we made adequate 

investments, adequate commitments, to that project.  In fact 

80,000 Afghan soldiers go out and fight, put their lives on the line 

every day.  You know, you’ve got incidents that you haven’t 

documented or described about fragging and for that you describe 

the entire institution as a failure, that’s just, I don’t understand 

how you can argue that, that the…   President Obama ran for office 

signaling that this is what he intended to do, he argued that the 

Bush administration had taken American resources, attention and 

potential, and invested it mistakenly in Iraq, and that he was going 

to right that balance by turning back to finish what the Bush 

administration failed to complete in Afghanistan.   He’s been in 

office for less than a year.  And how do—how you reach a 

comprehensive judgment about his potential in performance, at the 

same time that you believe that the preservation of the 

constitutional Afghan state is of American national interest, you’re 

arguing we should stay, you’re not arguing we should go.  So, I 

think this is achievable—  [BRIEF APPLAUSE]

questions, now remember my rules about questions.  I need them 

to have question marks at the end.  [LAUGHTER]  We really want

them to be questions.  And we would like them to be as close as 

possible to relevant to our topic tonight, ma’am?  [LAUGHTER]    

 MICHELE STEINBERG 

My name is Michele Steinberg, I’m from Washington, D.C., with EIR 

News Service.  First to Mr. Nagl and Cole, I have a two-part 

question, one…at a recent counterinsurgency conference at the 

National Press Club and also at the Kerry Committee, I think it was 

Mr. Biddle, they were talking about figures of 400,000 or 600,000 

troops to carry out this counterinsurgency.  On closer examination 

it was, a large part of those would be Afghanistan soldiers.  But 

that is enormous, and we need a comment for this audience about 

that,   secondly, Mr. Coll, what you defined as success, I’m rather 

stunned about.  To prevent a government of the Taliban in 

Afghanistan…and to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the 

hands of Taliban or al-Qaeda or Mumbai terrorists in Pakistan 

being the definition of success, is so minimal… that there must be 

many paths to that other than four to six—400 to 600,000 troops.   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Okay, thank you—  

 MICHELE STEINBERG 

 Please comment.   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Thank you, Steve Coll, take that question.

 STEVE COLL  

Well, I think you’re right, I deliberately laid out what I thought the 

minimal US interests were, and I don’t think that anyone believes 

that 400 or 600,000 troops are necessary to achieve those, in fact, 

I’m quite sure that they’re not.  Ultimately, it may be that the 

combination of Afghan soldiers and Afghan police required to 

provide Afghan-directed security to Afghans, will be in that range.   

But there’s certainly no need to fight a war, today, or any time soon 

with American or combined troops of that size.  In fact that’s not 

the plan, the plan is to hold the footprint of the cities with a much 

smaller force, and to challenge the Taliban, preserve the Afghan 

state long enough to build Afghan security forces and police,  that 

can in time under the direction of their own national leadership, 

complete this project, and, ultimately it will be Afghans themselves 

who’ll decide how many, what size army and police deployed in 

what way is necessary to provide the security they require.   This 

figure, to answer it, I’m sure John’ll want to say it is a 

mathematical calculation that actually has no bearing on US 

planning or policy.  It’s basically a ratio figure that some academics 

use to describe what is the ratio of troops to population that is 

ideally required, and I’m not even sure that it’s universally accepted 

as the correct ratio.   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Sir, your question.

 DENNIS COLE  

Yes, my name is Dennis Cole, I’m neither from a news service or 

have any expertise in the subject so I find this very interesting.—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 As long as it’s a question that’s okay.   

 DENNIS COLE  

It’s a question.  [LAUGHTER]  I understand the arguments that 

you’re— that some of the sides have been making or one side have 

been making about the Karzai government that we’re supporting, or 

maybe we’re defending.  Either we’re engaging in nation-building or 

we’re defending a government that might be corrupt, et cetera.   

But, from a, from just a layman’s perspective, I put myself in the 

shoes of the President of the United States.  It seems to me that the 

question that the President has to answer, and the question that 

each of you have to answer, is, we are in the middle of a war, we do 

have threats.  And, we, on one hand if we exit Afghanistan or if we 

pull back from Afghanistan and Pakistan, we in my mind would 

suffer—   that we would increase the probability of attacks here 

in…in the United States, on the other hand, if we stay there clearly 

we’re going to continue to lose young Americans so you have, a loss 

of life—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

I don’t mean to be rude, I just want you—  That’s—I think where

you’re going—   

 DENNIS COLE  

 So the question is if you had to make a decision between 

continuing to lose young Americans in Afghanistan and Pakistan to 

try to win, to try to succeed, or if you had to suffer the higher 

probability of losses here in America, what would you choose.   

 JOHN DONVAN  

It’s a terrific question—   

 RALPH PETERS  

 Yeah, can I get this—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 [UNCLEAR], um—    

 RALPH PETERS  

The Taliban did not attack us on 9/11.  Look…  [APPLAUSE]  You—

again, we’re obsessing on real estate.  This is a Leona Helmsley 

strategy.  [LAUGHTER]  al-Qaeda’s not interested in real estate 

except as a place to duck and cover.  We need to remember why we 

went to Afghanistan in the first place.   Afghanistan, I disagree with 

Steve Coll, it’s not a nation, it’s an accident of where other people’s 

borders ended, and here’s the key thing to take away from this part 

of it.  First of all, we’re very successful against al-Qaeda, and no 

one up here is arguing we have to pull out, it’s not either/or.   



Media Transcripts, Inc.

We’re—I’m arguing and others are arguing, do you want to get back 

to focusing on America’s enemies, which is much cheaper, more 

effective, and…just briefly.  We are repeating the last war in 

Afghanistan.  The surge, the surge.  What happened in Afghanistan 

although the surge helped, was that al-Qaeda was a foreign 

invader.  We were too.  But al-Qaeda was so monstrous, that they 

alienated millions of Muslims.   And when the Sunni Muslims 

decided that they were—al-Qaeda was a much more horrible and 

threatening foreign invader than we were, the game was won.  In 

Afghanistan, the Taliban are the home team.  Again, say what you 

want—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

But Ralph—I think the—   

 RALPH PETERS  

 People are dying—  

 JOHN DONVAN 

 —I think the question was, if the Taliban returns to hosting in their 

hotel, al-Qaeda, would we rather have—have the deaths there or 

here and I think it’s a good question—   

 RALPH PETERS  

Well, that doesn’t connect.  That just doesn’t connect—

 Well, let me just—   

 JAMES SHINN 

 Al-Qaeda was trying to—   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 Ralph, can we get another voice—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Let’s, let’s let Steve Clemons in—   

 RALPH PETERS  

 Mullah—Mullah—wait one second, Mullah Omar was trying to get 

rid of bin-Laden for over a year before 9/11, Osama bin-Laden 

wouldn’t go, there’s a lotta bad blood.  Don’t assume that the 

Taliban equals al-Qaeda.   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Steve Clemons.   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 I think that it’s dangerous, and sometimes counterproductive to 

look at questions and just in binary terms, that either you stay and 

you produce outcomes, you leave and you produce great 

consequences.  Sometimes those scenarios, there are probably, 

Steve Coll and I talk about this, six or seven different scenarios 

that, I think for the sake of the health of American society we ought

to talk about more systematically, in what you can achieve, but 

some things that I would put on the table because I respect all the 

gentleman on the other side is that sometimes, we look very blindly 

and with an interesting kind of confidence about the ability of the 

US military to sort of earnestly and proactively go and create and 

shape outcomes.   But it reminds me of trade deficits in economics, 

where frequently we look at GDP growth, we tend to not look at the 

current account deficit.  We tend to look at what we generate and 

we tend not to look at some of the negatives and draw down.  And 

what I fear is that there’s a blind spot in a lot of this discussion, 

about the down-side consequences of the size of the military 

footprint, in places that are very, very hostile to the narrative of 

colonialism, control, and that we don’t think about other ways to 

achieve some of the goals we might want to do, and so the question 

is efficacy, and actually getting efficacious outcomes, what I said 

about Richard Holbrooke.  I was in a briefing with Richard 

Holbrooke [UNCLEAR] and I can’t talk about the substance of it, 

other than I can talk about, he is doing some absolutely fascinating 

things, in a whole broad variety of areas but one of the area’s in 

agriculture.   Moving a lot of the poppy-growers into other areas.  

You can sort of look at transparent, tangible results, changing the 

sort of lives and direction but, let me tell you—   

 JAMES SHINN 

 But Steve, what do you want to do though—  



Media Transcripts, Inc.

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 —just quickly, let me—Jim, let me just finish.  The Taliban today, 

are delivering to their people, and this is a problem for us, 

accountability in political management.  Courts, property rights, 

security, trade, ombudsmen.  They are miserable on human rights, 

you would never want to be a woman living in those areas, and I 

think that it’s a night— it would be a nightmarish life on other 

fronts but in terms of the priorities people have, they’re there.  I 

talked to a Dubai businessman the other day who was telling me—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Steve, I want to—I want to bring Jim in—   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 Yeah.  Well—   

 JAMES SHINN 

 So what do you want to do, Steve.  I mean I appreciate your 

encomiums for Richard Holbrooke—   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 I want to seriously pull back—   

 JAMES SHINN 

 —I used to work for Richard Holbrooke—

 Yeah—

 JAMES SHINN 

 —at the State Department, and I have observed him in action.  But 

what do you want to do.  Do you want to split the difference?  Do 

you want to muddle through?   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

So glad you asked—   

 JAMES SHINN 

 What national interest do you want to achieve in Afghanistan and 

how are you going to do it—  

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Let him—let him answer, answer the question—   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

So glad I was asked, what I would like to see first of all 

[LAUGHTER] is for the administration, the Obama administration 

to get itself all on one page, and decide what it is about and what 

it’s achieved—trying to achieve.  That clarity has been absent.  I 

think with all due respect [APPLAUSE] to Barack Obama, whom I 

supported as well, Barack—the concern that many of our allies 

have had in this is that Barack Obama’s eye has not been on the 

Afghanistan ball since March.  It is now.   And I look for informed 

leadership, particularly since he’s reading Steve Coll’s book.  

[LAUGHTER]  But let me tell you what I said, I intimated some of 

the other things that need to be done.  We need to make this not an

American war in Afghanistan, it needs other major stakeholders, 

and not just NATO.  [APPLAUSE]   

 JOHN NAGL  

There are—   

 STEVE CLEMONS 

 If they don’t come in—   

 JOHN NAGL  

 —there are 41 countries engaged in this fight with us—   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

I know, this is a George W. Bush line, but China’s not there, 

Russia’s not there, there is not the broad stakeholders that I think 

matter—  

 JOHN NAGL  

 This is the broadest coalition in history—   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

It’s an important symbolic partnership, but when it comes to the 

substantive, pushing the needle on what’s going on—I don’t want to 

denigrate anyone else’s role--it is not enough.  Again this is not 

about, sloganeering, it’s not about--that I’m trying to make an 

assessment that the kind of weight that you need, consequential 

weight, to basically try and create an equilibrium there, remains 

absent.

better life.  7 percent…    

 STEVE CLEMONS  

John, 41 countries—   

 JOHN NAGL  

 Only 7 percent of the Afghan people support the Taliban, well over 

50 percent of the Afghan people want the Americans to— and the 

international community to be providing them with security.   The 

Afghans I’ve talked to don’t want Americans to leave, they want 

more of us there and they want us to do this better, and they in 

particular want us to build a big enough Afghan army, so that 

someday they can leave.   They want us to leave, but not yet, 

because they know what would happen to them if we did.

 STEVE CLEMONS

 — I just need to stop you because I need to do a little bit of a break 

for radio which will take about 20 seconds.  I want to remind you 

that we’re in the question-and-answer section of this Intelligence 

Squared US debate.  I’m John Donvan, your moderator, and we 

have six debaters, two teams of three who are debating this motion, 

“America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and 

Pakistan.”   And I want to go to the—there’s a woman who has 

already been…got the nod a little while ago—  There you are.  

And…it’s a question, again, please.

question, um, my name’s Tricia DeGennaro, I’m an adjunct 

professor here in the Global Affairs Department.  And also this 

question is for both sides.  I’ve been to Afghanistan quite a bit and 

thank you very much because you both hit very much on the 

complex issues that are going on there and the decision to stay or 

go, or transition out.   So within that context, how do each of you 

look at the mission which has not been defined yet, look at how to 



Media Transcripts, Inc.

better the command and control and collaboration or coordination 

on the ground, and, either if we transition out or stay there, we are 

going to need a better civilian service team there, and that we’re 

lacking, so I’d like you all to talk about that—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Steve Coll, can you take that first?   

 STEVE COLL  

 Well, I’m—we’ve all read the McChrystal report, but we don’t really 

know the answer to that very important question.  I have my own 

idea, I think actually the other panelists have some ideas that are 

probably not as wildly far away as some of our tones suggest since 

none of them wants to turn around and leave either.   Certainly, the 

notion of supporting the constitutional Afghan state by allowing it 

to build its own security forces more successfully than we’ve done 

so far, and by supporting the efforts that are already underway 

through the United Nations, NATO and others to bring, to keep the 

educational system that’s been build in Afghanistan, I don’t know 

what the numbers are but, tens of thousands of girls and women 

are in school today in universities.  You don’t have to go very far in 

Afghanistan to run into them and to be inspired.  And the idea that 

this is irrelevant to our presence in Afghanistan or to our security, 

just strikes me as self-deceiving.

But you—can I just answer—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Yes—   

 STEVE COLL  

 —her question because she asked a very specific question—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Right—   

 STEVE COLL  

 —about American civilian capacity, it’s a problem.  The—Hillary 

Clinton has come into the State Department and beaten every 

drum that I think she knows how to find to get the American 

civilian partnership that is called for in common sense as well as in 

counterinsurgency doctrine, better present in Afghanistan.   And I 

think…she’s going slower than she wants, but, everyone who’s 

involved says within a year there really is an opportunity to improve 

performance, I hope so because it is a critical question, I’m glad 

you asked it.   

 JAMES SHINN 

 If I could just say—

 JOHN DONVAN 

I want to bring Patrick Lang in here, we haven’t heard from him in 

a while.    

 PATRICK LANG  

Yeah.  The, I think there’s room, considerable room for agreement 

here, I mean I agree with Steve Coll’s idea that the —be a good idea 

to withdraw to the major footprint of the major towns.  And 

because—but to try to improve the countryside across Afghanistan 

is I think a visionary idea, as I’ve expressed before.   But within 

those enclaves which contain a large part of the population, you 

know, you can do all these things that people want to do that are, 

are good and worthy projects such as the education of women and 

the improvement of daily life, all that kinda stuff.   But in fact, you 

know, someone said earlier that you can’t go after the bad people 

unless you’ve got good and sufficient human intelligence.   Well, 

and that—you won’t be able to do that if they think you’re not going 

to pacify the country.  Well I don’t—I’m sorry, I don’t believe that’s 

true, you know, I was in the business of running human 

intelligence for the Defense Department for a long time.   And in 

fact the way that you recruit spies, is—a variety of inducements 

often based on their peculiar psychology, each and every person, 

you know.  And it’s a question of applied psychology in the field.   

So, the fact that you couldn’t acquire people, if you had a number 

of bases around in Afghanistan you couldn’t acquire people that

you could use to penetrate enemy formations and then have 

enough troops on the ground, not the huge force of the troops, but 

some troops, augmented by the Afghan national army,  and using a 

lot of these tribal guys, who don’t like the radicalism of the Taliban 

or Wahhabi-inspired, absolute kind of Islam that they don’t like, 

you know, you can go after enough of our enemies to disrupt them 

and keep them at bay, without having to try to take this whole 

country over, and to transform it into something that’ll be 

altogether different.  I don’t—as I’ll say again—I just think that’s too 

big a task for us.

 ZACK CLEMENTS 

 Hello, my name is Zack Clements and I’m a student at NYU.  And 

we were actually discussing this issue in class today a little bit.  

And I wanted to ask a little bit more about your endgame strategy 

for—   We’ve defined success in the most minimalist terms possible.  

In a survey of 127 different countries during the Cold War period it 

shows that, democracy and stability tends to decrease 20 to 25

percent post-intervention by a superpower.   After we leave 

eventually, what institutions are we actually leaving behind, to 

prevent similar instability that we saw for the past 50 years.  And 

then in that same vein, to what extent is the war on terror in 

general, a relic of the Cold War, and is it necessary today for 

American security—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

 Okay, I—Zack, I’m going to not use your second question because 

it’s really not to our point although it’s a interesting one we’ll put 

into a future debate perhaps.  [LAUGHS]  But your, but your first 

question, what institutions may be left behind, I’d like to go—I 

assume you’re putting that to the side that’s arguing that we can 

succeed.  And any member of that panel can step forward.  [PAUSE]  

John Nagl.   

 JOHN NAGL 

The McChrystal report advocates the creation of a very large and 

strong Afghan army in order to enable an American departure, 

leaving behind a stable Afghanistan that does not support terror, 

and that does not drag down the region, putting further burdens on 

Pakistan and the other neighbors.   That Afghan army of some 

250,000 which is roughly three times the Afghan army today is 

something we know how to build.  This is not something we’ve 

worked to build to date.  The Afghan army is undersized, only 

80,000, about twice the size of the New York City police force.   New

York City is a tough town, but Afghanistan is tougher, and a whole 

heck of a lot bigger.  So, until we start—and by the way right now 

today as we speak, we are only providing 50 percent of the advisors 

to the Afghan national army that we say are required.   We’re fixing 

that now, this is another one of the 4,000 additional troops 

President Obama sent back in March are just arriving in country 

now, the Fourth Brigade of the 82nd Airborne.  So we need to build 

an Afghanistan that can survive without us, and we are starting 

that effort now.   We are eight years into this thing, we frankly

 Well, you know, we’re not really good at building institutions 

anywhere, as I think you pointed out in your question, and I 

concur with Dr. Lang on that point.  But in the end the Afghans are 

going to do this.  I mean, eight years is a long time, but it’s pretty 

fast to come from basically devastation…  three decades of 

destruction, at the hands of various invaders, to actually hold an 

election themselves.  I mean it’s pretty amazing, and when you 

travel through the provinces and towns of Afghanistan, and you see 

what was there before, and you see what’s there now…it’s—  So 

that’s the answer, the Afghans are going to work it out.

troubled by several things.  Question.  There has been so much 

emphasis on Afghanistan.  I would like to know, your approach to 

Pakistan, which after all is a different country, and this lecture was 

supposed to be, this debate, about the two countries, and I have 

not heard very much about your approach to Pakistan.   Secondly, 

there was an article in the International Herald Tribune today, 

talking about the fact that in Pakistan, they absolutely detest us, 

they want no part of us, and I would like to know how that problem 

also affects our approach.

 STEVE COLL  

 So… it’s a great—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

 Steve Coll, first, and you’re on the side arguing that America can 

succeed.   

 STEVE COLL  

That’s a great question, American policy in Pakistan over the last 

30 years has been a failure.  And only now are we proving the 

value—the truth of Churchill’s quip that after trying everything else 

we eventually get it right.  The Congress passed Kerry-Luger 

legislation last year making a long, deep commitment, not to the 

Pakistan army, but to the Pakistani people, to the Pakistani 

constitutional system, to pluralism and development in Pakistan, 

and for the first time we are send— our government is sending a 

clear and reliable signal that we intend to invest in the broader 

health of the Pakistani state and its future success.   The standing 

of the United States and public opinion in Pakistan is low.  It is 

unfortunately three times higher now than it was just a few years 

ago.  I don’t think that’s the metric of our success.   Our interests 

do not lie in being popular in Pakistan, our interests lie in Pakistan 

succeeding.  And the biggest change in public opinion that’s 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

occurred in Pakistan during the last two years and it’s very recent 

has been the decision by broadly based, diverse Pakistanis to reject 

the violence, the nihilist violence, of the Taliban and al-Qaeda.   

They have been the victims, of this—of their own Frankenstein 

monster, and they’ve come to recognize that they will not live in a 

country, they cannot live in a country, that is influenced by these 

groups.  The United States has an obligation and interest in 

supporting that momentum.  In the end, that’s what allows us to 

protect our own security and ultimately exit from South Asia, so I 

don’t think it’s a popularity contest.  It’s about the success of 

Pakistanis themselves and they’re well on their way, in a region 

where, by the way, India’s own success is already lifting Pakistan 

into new directions, creating new incentives for economic 

integration and regional stability.    

 JOHN DONVAN  

And let’s hear from the side that argues America cannot succeed.   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 I think—   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Steve Clemons—   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

I think what Steve Coll just shared is true, but there’s also another 

truth in Pakistan, where, you get equations like the ally of our ally

turns out to be our enemy.  And to some degree, there was a time 

when I had lunch with the former head of ISI and I was late to the 

lunch like I often am and didn’t know it was the former head of 

ISI—   

 JOHN DONVAN  

 Can you tell the audience who ISI is.

 STEVE CLEMONS  

 And they’re off, they are rumored to have helped seed the terrorist 

groups in Mumbai and they are active with some elements of the 

Taliban.   And I asked this general, I said does President 

Musharraf, then-President Musharraf control the ISI and this 

General Jurani [PH] told me that President Musharraf has a lot to 

gain by acting like he doesn’t.   And, in that kind of world, it’s, as

Steve Coll knows better than anyone else, you have a problem 

where we’re not always quite sure where the security apparatus of 

that state is.  And that regardless, and I agree completely that 

something interesting has been achieved in Pakistan, so let them 

have it.   Let them become their own barriers to Islamic jihadism 

and the most extreme elements of their societies.  And I think if 

you’re fair with Pakistan society they’ve done a fairly good job of 

keeping the minority extreme parties…  Islamist parties have been 

kept a minority in their political system.  Let that continue to 

percolate, I don’t think it’s quite as vulnerable at even the point 

where we were worried before the Swat offensive.  So, to a certain 

degree that’s there but I also worry about the fact that, the ISI may 

be taking us for a ride again, where we don’t quite know when 

they’re going to push buttons that actually destabilize the situation.  

I think Steve is right to say we have an opportunity to maybe get a 

deal, a grand bargain.   But I have some concerns about that, just 

given the behaviors we’ve seen, and our own lack of contact with a 

whole range of managers, colonels and majors, within the ISI today 

that maybe Pat Lang needs to go over and spend some time with 

but—

I have a question for the cannot and will not side because what 

you’re essentially advocating, is a counterterrorism strategy using 

long-range strikes to kill terrorist leaders in Afghanistan and 

Pakistan.  Now as you know, Stan McChrystal—   

 PATRICK LANG  

No.   

 RALPH PETERS 

 No, no, that’s not what we’re advocating—

 RALPH PETERS 

 I—where did I ever say kill them and get out.  You show me one 

place.  One of my books, one article, one TV show, when did I say 

that.  That’s just nonsense.   What I said was what—Joe Biden’s 

saying.  That we need a small, lethal force focused on our enemies.  

Of course we need boots on the ground—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

Well that’s, Ralph, if I could ask my question, that’s basically 

what’s known as a counterterrorism strategy—   

 RALPH PETERS 

 Yeah—  

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

 —that’s the alternative to the counterinsurgency strategy that the 

other side is advocating.  My question is, as you know, Stan 

McChrystal was our top counterterrorist, he was the head of the 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

Joint Special Operations Command, from 2003 to 2008.  He was 

the guy who was out there in charge of the forces that were 

capturing Saddam Hussein, killing Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.   He 

knows more about our Special Operations capability than anybody 

else live.  But he has conclude that all our counterterrorist 

capabilities are not capable of keeping us safe in Afghanistan and 

Pakistan and that we need to do—  [APPLAUSE]   

 RALPH PETERS 

 That, that is not—   

 MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER

 RALPH PETERS 

 That—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

 —and the others—    

 JOHN DONVAN  

 [UNCLEAR] want to hear what the question is—  

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER 

 My question is—   

 RALPH PETERS  

 Yeah, what is the question—   



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

My question is, why do you have more confidence in our 

counterterrorist capabilities than our top counterterrorist general.    

 RALPH PETERS 

Well, for two reasons.  [APPLAUSE]  First of all because, you’re 

mixing apples and oranges—   

MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER  

 Do I get to answer this—?   

 RALPH PETERS 

General McChrystal was given a mission, by the President.  And the 

mission was pacify Afghanistan.  He succeeded wonderfully, in the 

counterterrorism.  But he has failed miserably and we will continue 

to fail, in the pacification effort.   Now, nobody—I hate this stuff 

where people twist what you say.  I said that we need a compact, 

lethal force, you need boots on the ground for intelligence, you need 

Special Forces, you need enough conventional forces for raising 

security.   You probably need 15 or 25,000 guys.  You don’t need 

120,000 guys, and so, again, let’s—please, let’s be fair to each other 

and listen to what the other persons say, and not try to score 

points.   The other answer is this.  I get calls from the military 

around the world.  There’s a myth out there that the military 

supports General McChrystal’s strategy.  The calls I get are running 

about 50 to 1 against sending more troops.   Only call or message

chance to try to change your minds before we vote, and, to recall, 

before the debate began we asked you to vote, your stance on this 

motion which is “America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in 

Afghanistan and Pakistan,” here are the results of that preliminary

is arguing against the motion, America cannot and will not succeed 

in Afghanistan and Pakistan.   

 STEVE COLL 

Well thanks, I’ve enjoyed the evening and, I came here not very 

much interested in the debate and the competition but interested 

in the discourse and the moment in the country’s life and the 

opportunity to speak freely about how I see a very complicated 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

problem.   And I think we’ve done that in a lot of good ways, so I 

hate to get sort of all technical and debatey on you but I would 

point out, [LAUGHTER]  that we actually more or less all six of us 

agree on the question [LAUGHS] before you which is, that we can 

succeed.   What we disagree with—and we actually all agree on the 

definition of success, which is an America that’s safe from its 

enemies, a stable, region, where we have access to our enemies, 

and we tend to think that we need some kind of Afghan state, I 

think, nobody wants to leave so I take from their willingness to stay 

that they’re willing to stay in an Afghan state.   Well that’s more or 

less the minimum interests and definition of success that I outlined 

at the beginning.  What we’ve disagreed about are a lot of really 

important subjects that are now before the President, they’re just 

not before you.   They’re basically whether or not we should send 

more troops, whether we should pursue a counterinsurgency 

strategy that emphasizes rural population security versus urban, 

whether we should invest in Afghan security forces or whether we 

believe in the plausibility of that project to different degrees.   But 

the basic notion is that America does have vital interests in both 

countries, and that the failure of our efforts to stabilize this region 

and prevent Pakistan, for example, from falling apart, are important 

enough to take these risks, there are risks in every direction.   And 

I think we’ve had a good conversation about where some of those 

risks lie, but the fundamental question, do we have a reason to be

there, can we through this kind of discourse find the right strategy 

to succeed, I think we’ve answered that question, all of us, thank 

you.

Thank you, Steve Coll.  [APPLAUSE]  Making his closing statement, 

Patrick Lang, retired US military intelligence officer, a former Green 

Beret who is arguing that America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in 

Afghanistan and Pakistan, Patrick Lang—   

 PATRICK LANG  

Well I think we’ve moved on beyond that, the question of the day 

here.  I don’t have any quarrel at all really with what Steve said 

there.  This is really a question of strategy and methodology, rather 

than ultimate goals with regard to this place I think.   And I would 

point out to you that I would maintain completely that if in fact we 

decided to do a countryside wide in the hot parts of Afghanistan, all 

the Pashtun, across the Pashtun Belt and some other places as 

well, I think that the costs are going to go up so high in all the 

various ways that I’ve said before, you know, that in a couple years’ 

time you’re going to decide that there is going to be an endgame, 

right, because it’s got to—because we’re going to leave.   That’s 

going to be the problem, and that’ll be bad, in a way because, this 

place will continue to be a breeding ground for Islamic zealots who 

are in league with other Islamic zealots in other parts of the world 

and who are dangerous to us.  So that shouldn’t happened, I would

propose in fact, instead that what we ought to do, is hold the major 

cities, make sure that, that the Taliban don’t have a seat in the UN 

again, and use these places as bases from which we can affect a 

strategy of in-depth human penetration of the groups we really 

don’t like, and the use of various dissident parts of the tribal 

population that can be used for our purposes and they can be used 

for our purposes, I—this is not an impossible thing to do.   And 

have a certain number of troops on the ground that you can use for 

those kinds of purposes.  Now, that would be a far smaller number 

of troops probably than we have.  Now, in that kind of strategy it 

may well be that there’s not going to be an endgame, in fact.  

Because this place is going to be dangerous for a long, long time, 

people there are not going to change very quickly, although we’ll do 

everything we can to improve their lives if they—  And it may be 

necessary to maintain a presence in that country for a very long 

time, in order to ensure that we can carry out the goals of 

protecting the American people, that we need to focus on.

his position against the motion, John Nagl who is president of the 

Center for New American Security.  John Nagl.    

 JOHN NAGL  

Pat has just described what to my eyes is the critical weakness of a 

counterterrorism strategy, which is that there is no end state, that 



Media Transcripts, Inc. 

PROGRAM         Rosenkranz Foundation—“Intelligence Squared U.S.”—“America Cannot and

we’ll have to be there forever.  And I believe that the American 

people deserve security, and that the Afghan people deserve 

security and that there’s a way to achieve that in a reasonable 

period of time with a reasonable commitment of resources.   I have 

tried the counterterrorism strategy, I have tried to practice 

counterinsurgency without enough boots on the ground, in al-

Anbar Province in 2004.  I worked to train Iraqi police and Iraqi 

army, the insurgents killed them.   I worked to build better 

economic opportunities for the Iraqi people, and they were 

destroyed by the insurgents.  And so, much as we would like there 

to be an easy way out of this, if we ever want to depart Afghanistan 

and have that flank secure, with al-Qaeda never again able to use 

Afghanistan as a safe haven for terror, then there is an investment 

we are going to have to make.   We have made an extraordinary 

investment already, and it is, frankly it is many of my friends, your 

sons and daughters, your friends who are out making that 

investment.  The best chance for a positive return on that 

investment, a secure and stable Afghanistan, a secure and stable 

Pakistan.   Objectives that all of us here agree are of vital national 

interest to the United States, but should be accomplished, and it is 

within the power of the United States to accomplish.   It is my 

personal belief that the best way to accomplish them, is through a 

properly resourced counterinsurgency strategy that is the approach 

advocated by General McChrystal, it is hard, but hard is not

impossible.

Thank you, John Nagl.  Our motion is “America Cannot and Will 

Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan” and summarizing for the 

motion, Steve Clemons, publisher of the political blog, The 

Washington Note, Steve Clemons.   

 STEVE CLEMONS  

America will not succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan unless it gets 

its act back together both on the questions of management and 

strategy, both of which it has failed miserably in over the last eight 

years with regard to this challenge.   The issue is not just 

Afghanistan and Pakistan, it’s the bigger picture, of what is going 

on in the United States, rewriting to some degree America’s place in 

the world in what I think is a historic moment of opportunity but 

discontinuity with the past.   Barack Obama has a huge challenge.  

The mystique of America’s superpower status was somewhat 

shattered by Iraq, where other nations saw our limits, our military 

limits, our economic limits, and our moral limits.  All of that has to 

be reinvented.   And while I’ve heard great arguments from our 

colleagues on the other side, I have not seen a general 

understanding that we need to begin thinking about the sort of 

place and mission we have 20 or 30 or 40 years out.   We haven’t

discussed nearly enough what alternative strategies might actually 

generate a better human-rights regime, better opportunities for 

women democratic rights that we’ve seen fail miserably I think in 

the recent elections, under our management.  We were the 

stewards of that election that just unfolded, in great degree and to 

some—and I think no matter where you look, turned out to be quite 

a bad deal.  And trying to restore America’s place and the sense 

that America has leverage over important global affairs, is really 

vital in dealing with nuclear nonproliferation.   Iran, recreating 

some sense that we have consequence and weight.  So it’s not just 

about Afghanistan and Pakistan, being stuck in the mud there, and 

not coming up, and just having a strategy that throws more troops 

at the challenge, without saying how can you get to some 

consistent level of benchmarks that are shared within a team both 

military and on the smart power side of the equation.   Until that’s 

done, I can’t see in any way that sending more resources into that 

fixes those management mistakes.   

 JOHN DONVAN 

 Thank you, Steve Clemons.  [APPLAUSE]  Summarizing against the 

motion, James Shinn, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for 

Asia, and National Intelligence Officer for East Asia.   

 JAMES SHINN 

 I think Steve Coll said that, that we seem to be converging on 

agreement, across the room, that we have vital interests, and that

we can and will succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  We do 

disagree I think on the tactics, but that’s, again is not the real issue 

here.   I think, looking out ahead that we are going to be having 

this debate, this national debate about the ends and means in 

Afghanistan and Pakistan repetitively, for some period of time.  But 

I also think we have, the President has on his desk a fairly clear 

strategy, by about the best people we can think to do it.   And 

execution matters…properly resourcing it matters, and signaling 

matters, to the Taliban, to the Afghans, and to the Pakistanis.  I 

think the worst thing we could do, is simply split the difference, put 

in place some artificial metrics, that we can use to hold, for 

example the Pakistanis accountable, and simply allows things to 

drift.  That would be the worst of all possible worlds.  I think we 

can and we will succeed, in Afghanistan and Pakistan.   

[APPLAUSE]   

 JOHN DONVAN  

Thank you, James Shinn.  And, finally to summarize for the 

motion, Ralph Peters, a former US, uh, Army lieutenant-colonel and 

author of The War After Armageddon.  Ralph Peters.    

 RALPH PETERS  

When generals are out of ideas, they ask for more troops.  It is 

stunning to me how little we’ve talked about our troops tonight.  

This isn’t abstract, they have to do it.  Our troops are worn down,

the equipment’s worn down.  But yet they will do anything we ask 

them to do.   If the President asks them to stay in Afghanistan in 

increased numbers by God they’ll do it.  But we should ask them to 

do sensible things.  Sensible things.  Missions that could be 

achieved.  So let me leave you, the audience, with a few questions.   

If the Karzai government is worthy, why don’t Afghans support it.  

Why did they have to steal an election.  If Afghans want us to stay, 

why are our casualties climbing dramatically.  If as you heard 

Afghans are fighting, why must we send more troops.   If 

international support is so dramatic, why must we send 40,000 

more troops.  If we cannot articulate the mission, and the end 

state, how dare we send more young men and women in uniform, 

because we won’t force ourselves to answer the fundamental 

question, of what— why are we there, and what, concretely, do we 

expect to achieve.  So I will leave you, with a question General 

Petraeus asked several years ago about Iraq.  Tell me how this 

ends.   

[APPLAUSE]   

 JOHN DONVAN 

Thank you, Ralph Peters.  And that concludes our closing remarks 

and now it is time to learn which side you feel argued best, it is 

time for you to pick the winner.  We’re asking you right now once 

again to go those keypads on the left side of your seat that will 

register your vote.   And we are going to get the read-out almost

instantaneously, once again our motion is, “America Cannot and 

Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan”…  To remind you 

before the vote…48 percent of you were for the motion, 25 percent 

of you were against the motion, and 27 percent were undecided,  

and as we said before the side that changes the most minds will be 

declared the winner.  [PAUSE, AUDIENCE VOICES]  Okay, we’re 

going to lock out the keypads.  And the results will be with us in 

just a second.   In the meantime I first of all wanted to thank all of 

the questioners who actually…gave us things with question marks 

and they really moved the debate along.  Thank you to all of you 

and to those of you who we did not get to, I apologize.  But we’ll see 

you next time.  [APPLAUSE]   And also thank you to all of our 

panelists for a terrific evening, well argued, honestly argued.  

[APPLAUSE]  Our next debate will be Tuesday, it’s October 27th, the 

motion will be, “Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media.”  

[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]   Panelists for the motion will be the host 

of Public Radio’s “The Takeaway,” John Hockenberry, executive 

editor of The Politico Jim VandeHei and Michael Wolff, Vanity Fair 

columnist and founder of Newser.com.   Against the motion, 

executive vice-president and editor-at-large of the San Francisco 

Chronicle Phil Bronstein, columnist and reporter for the New York 

Times David Carr, and editor and publisher of The Nation, Katrina 

vanden Heuvel.   All of our debates will continue to be heard on 

more than 190 NPR stations across the country, and, to that point,

when I announce the results, just to give the radio broadcast a very 

nice flourish, at one point my arm will come up and I would love it 

if you would applaud at that point, and the incentive is knowing 

that your applause will be heard on 200 NPR stations around the 

world.  [LAUGHTER]   You can also watch the fall debates on 

Bloomberg’s television network and read about them in the next 

edition of Newsweek.  Books by tonight’s panelists and DVD’s of 

past debates are also on sale in the lobby.   All right, it is now in.  I 

have been given the results and, remember that the team that 

changes the most minds is declared the victor, and here it is, before 

the debate, 48 percent were for the motion, 25 percent were 

against, 27 percent were undecided.  After the debate, 43 percent 

are for the motion, 45 percent against, 12 percent undecided, the 

side against…is our winner.  [APPLAUSE]  Congratulations to them, 

thank you for all of you from me, John Donvan, and from 

Intelligence Squared US.
