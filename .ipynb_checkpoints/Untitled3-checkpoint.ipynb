      "[\"Well, I actually don't think so. No. But look, this is an issue that everybody feels very strongly and personally about. I'm the father of two girls on college campuses. I feel strongly about it too. That's why it's so important to have debates like this one.\", 'My partner is professor of law at Harvard University, Jeannie Suk.', 'Thank you. And welcome to the second most important debate happening in America tonight. [laughter] It\\'s a -- it\\'s a deep honor to be here, and I want to thank the organizers and also you, the audience, for coming.  So, yes, one of my daughters is a college sophomore. The other just started law school.  I\\'m very concerned about keeping our campuses safe from sexual assault.  That\\'s a goal that everyone on this stage shares.  But the way to achieve that goal is not by having colleges conduct rape trials when they\\'re incompetent to do it.  I\\'m about to use some strong words.  I wouldn\\'t do it except that this is the reality, and we need to face it.  As the result of campus sexual assault trials, actual rapists all over the country are going free to rape again, while innocent people -- it\\'s impossible to know how many.  But I\\'m talking about people who haven\\'t committed any sexual assault at all -- are being found guilty and having their lives wrecked by an error ridden, unreliable process that\\'s filled with conflicts of interest and violations of due process, all of it covered by a thick layer of non-transparency.  Now, my partner, Jeannie, is going to cover the serious due process violations, so I\\'m going to talk to you about the basic competency and neutrality and transparency issues.  But there\\'s something extremely important to both Jeannie and me. I want to say it first, that this is not, for us, a debate between the rights of the accused versus the rights of the victim.  An incompetent process produces errors on both sides.  It\\'s unfair to both victims and the accused.  The errors run in both directions, and I will give you examples of those in a moment.  But first, just some quick background on how we got to where we are today.  In 2011, the federal government sent a letter to every college and university in the country telling them that if they didn\\'t start trying rape cases they would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in defunding penalties, and forcing us to comply with a set of procedures dictated by the government, including, for example, lowering the standard of proof.  Now, I\\'m sure this letter was well intentioned.  But the problem is that college trials totally lack the necessary expertise, neutrality and transparency.  Let me start with competence.  The primary forensic tool in a rape case -- you\\'ve probably heard of it -- it\\'s a rape kit.  It\\'s basically a medical forensic examination of the victim. Now, most college personnel don\\'t even know what a rape kit is.  Or say a woman believes she was the victim of a date rape drug.  Say she was the victim.  That kind of case requires a laboratory toxicology result.  That\\'s how you make that case.  Most colleges do not run such laboratories and can\\'t do that.  A recent college rape case was decided by a panel of three judges, one person from engineering, one from food services, and one foreign exchange student.  In another case, an accused male student was essentially acquitted not because he was found innocent, but because he broke down at the hearing and admitted his alcoholism problem.  The woman accuser was stunned to see her rapist sitting in class with her the next week.  At Stanford, the teaching manual for rape judges includes an article saying that if the accused act -- if the accused acts as if he\\'s the victim, that\\'s an indicator of guilt.  Another indicator of guilt is if he, quote, \"Acts logical and persuasive.\"  This kind of -- [laughter] I\\'m not kidding. This kind of incompetent decision making is leading to miscarriages of justice of a kind you wouldn\\'t imagine in America.  And how about impartiality?  In our courts, we have a process we\\'ve worked out for centuries to ensure that our judges and juries are disinterested, that they don\\'t know the parties, don\\'t know anybody who does know the parties, that they\\'re not subject to rumors and pressures.  In college rape trials, it\\'s the opposite.  These are people from the same community.  They are subject to pressures.  They sometimes know the parties.  They sometimes know people who do know the parties.  Athlete -- athletic coaches decide if athletes committed rape.  Students decide cases involving students.  Now, again, these conflicts, they hurt victims and accused alike.  In some cases, colleges have a huge incentive to sweep rape cases under the rug, to cover them up.  And that can lead to guilty people being found innocent.  In other cases, it\\'s the opposite.  Especially today, colleges are feeling a lot of pressure under threat from the federal government to show how seriously they take these cases and to make an example. And that can lead to innocent people being found guilty, to be expelled, and if their names leak out, to be branded with a stigma that they have no way to ever clear themselves of.  Compare this to what happens when a murder takes place on a college campus.  We don\\'t hold campus homicide trials.  We all expect the police, the DA, the FBI and the courts to take charge.  Rape is a crime as serious as homicide.  It\\'s not like plagiarism or cheating on an exam.  That\\'s the kind of thing college disciplinary panels are good at.  We should treat rape with the same seriousness as we do other major crimes.  But worst of all, I haven\\'t even gotten to the worst thing of all.  What happens when the college rape trial works just the way it\\'s supposed to work; when an actual rapist is found guilty?  What happens next?  Let me ask you a question.  If you had proof that somebody in your neighborhood had committed an act of rape, what was the -- what\\'s the worst possible thing you could do?  Here\\'s the worst thing:  Push that person out of your neighborhood, but never tell anybody else what happened. Keep his name confidential.  That literally is what colleges do in these cases.  They expel the student but keep his identity a total secret because the college process, unlike a court, has no transparency.  It\\'s all covered with confidentiality.  And I can\\'t stress how important this is.  Some empirical studies out there have suggested that up to 90 percent of college rapes are being committed by fewer than 5 percent of college men, a relative handful of serial rapists, averaging over six rapes each.  Yet colleges, when they catch these serial rapists, simply push them out of their neighborhood, leaving them free to commit sexual assault elsewhere, their secret kept safe within the college bureaucracy.  That\\'s why we need courts to handle these cases.  Now finally, it\\'s critical to acknowledge that the courts are far from perfect, the police are far from perfect.  Too often in the past they have failed victims of sexual assault. We can do better.  We have to do better.  And in the end, it\\'s not courts or colleges, one or the other.  That\\'s a kind of debating artificiality.  We all know that both have a role to play.  There\\'s a huge amount colleges can do, but they should be focused on education and prevention, which they can do well, not on adjudication which they can\\'t.  Ideally, we bridge the gap.  Get colleges and police working together.  That\\'s what I\\'ve advocated, and it\\'s happening.  Here in New York, there\\'s just been the creation of a special sexual assault enforcement unit, first of its kind in the country.  It\\'s specifically designed to go out and work with both colleges and local police to help them get together and do their jobs better.  But the primary responsibility for investigating and trying rape cases has to be with police and courts.  That\\'s what we\\'re asking you to vote for.  A vote for our side of this debate is a vote that not campuses, but courts should be the primary place where rape trials are conducted.  And we urge you --', '-- to vote that way.', 'Well, I don\\'t think that\\'s a fair characterization, Michelle. Look, it\\'s really rare -- really rare to have colleges adjudicate a homicide. That almost never happens. It\\'s really rare - - almost never happens for colleges to try and adjudicate an act of arson. Rape is as serious a crime as homicide and arson. We do not typically -- we have never typically adjudicated major serious crimes like that. Plagiarism, yes, of course. Colleges are good at that. They know about that. Hazing? Hazing, fraternity stuff, that\\'s a college problem. It makes sense for colleges to deal with hazing. But we are talking about treating rape very differently through this Title IX process, not treating it the same. Treating it the same would be an expectation that the police, and the courts, and the Das, and the FBI come in an investigate this. And I do -- I need to say one more thing about our resolution. It\\'s very important. For some reason, the other side is trying to characterize the resolution before you as barring colleges from doing anything about this, barring them from hearing these kind of claims. That\\'s not true. That\\'s not what the resolution does. The resolution says, \"Courts, not campuses, should decide.\" Not barring them. The question is for you all to send a message that the body that should decide these cases are courts, not campuses, for all the reasons we have said. It\\'s -- as John said at the beginning of this debate, the question before you, \"Is it preferable for courts to be deciding?\" And in an ideal world, if colleges could do it just as well, fine. But unfortunately, it\\'s been a disaster. And the right answer is that courts should be the ones deciding.', \"Well, Stephen, if I might, you know, I was really -- no, the resolution is that courts should be doing it, because they're the ones that have the competence--\", 'If I could add about the groping problem.', \"This is the problem of mixing together -- look, by sexual assault, this term, I understand to mean rape, okay? What I have said throughout all my arguments, and this is what Jeannie was saying, too, is those are the cases the courts should be trying, not campuses.  Now, what's happening is that this term is getting expanded, as Jeannie was saying to mean -- cover a whole lot of other things.  And Stephen's argument about this groping thing is, you wouldn't want that in a criminal court.  Police aren't going to prosecute.  If courts -- if campuses want to have a code against offensive touching, sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, sure, those are things that campuses could do well.  And they should be able to do that.  We are talking about sexual assault here.  Let's not expand that term so that it means all kinds of things -- other things and confuse the issue.\", \"Well, I think Michelle's exactly right.  We've seen an era when colleges, the big incentive was to sweep them under the rugs -- under the rug now.  The incentive has changed.  That is not the way, as Jeannie is saying, to get conflicts of interest out of a process. That's the way to inject conflict of interest into a process.  You don't want to give colleges an incentive to find a certain way, either way.  And today, now they have this incentive to make examples, to show how seriously they're taking these things.  And you can't say, well, now they've got pressures on both sides and it'll come out fine.  No.  Two conflicts of interest don't equal impartiality.\", \"The alternative is just to do with rape what we do with murder and arson.  The alternative is you call the police, you expect them to do a professional, proper investigation, and you encourage students to report to the police. We heard earlier tonight that only about 5 percent of college women students who are victims are reporting.  That's a huge problem.  The alternative is to work better between colleges and the police to encourage reporting, to get these cases into the criminal justice system where rapists can get the punishment that they should get, and we can make our campuses and communities safer.\", 'Well, thanks for that great question. As you can guess, my answer is going to be the courts. [laughter] Because it is very hard to deter people from serious crimes if you slap them on the wrist for doing it. And being told to write a paper or even a suspension, that\\'s a slap on the wrist.  Now, expulsion is a serious penalty. But if you keep that a secret, and it\\'s non- transparent, that is not the way you deter sexual assault. I got to add one little point about a previous statement. The burden of proof that the government has forced us to use -- us colleges to use -- preponderance of the evidence -- look, at Yale, what\\'s our standard of proof for a plagiarism case? It\\'s clear and convincing evidence. That, legally - - for those of you who know, that\\'s a standard up from preponderance of the evidence. That\\'s what we do with all our cases. Now, with rape, we\\'re forced to use a lower one. I got to say one more thing -- mediation. You have to understand -- this goes to the work- related question before. Title IX has forced us to not do -- we\\'re barred from doing mediation. What would grown-ups do with a groping allegation, grown-ups at a school? They bring the parties in, get them to agree. \"You\\'re not going to do this anymore. You agree. Right? If you break this agreement, you will be subject to penalties.\" They agree. That\\'s called mediation. No. We can\\'t do that anymore because Title IX --', '[inaudible] --', \"Sure, we do.  I mean, 50 schools are under investigation.  They've been charged by the federal government with not enforcing and finding sexual assaults to be happening sufficiently.  And the threat is hundreds of millions of dollars in defunding.  So you have the threat which applies to all of them.  You have 50 schools under investigation.  And I can tell you from personal experience that the administrators, the deans, the Title IX coordinators are very, very afraid of being found liable by the Department of Education, by the Office of Civil Rights.  And if you talk to them, you will hear this fear expressed all the time.\", \"The courts have the competence, the impartiality, the neutrality to do this properly.  That's where you get justice.  Nobody's talking about barring the schools from doing anything.  The question is -- I'd like you to send this message -- that courts should be the ones deciding these cases because that's where -- that's the institution we've built up for 200 years to do justice.  And it's not happening in a conflict of interest ridden and error ridden process. [bell rings]\", \"Thank you.  Many of you probably remember the case I'm about to mention to you, the Duke Lacrosse case.  That was when a woman accused three lacrosse players falsely, it turned out, of raping her at a house party.  What was the university reaction to those false rape accusations?  It was panic.  The coach was immediately fired.  Suspensions.  Everyone called for the expulsion of the accused students. 88 Duke professors placed an ad calling that rape a disaster.  All around the country there was a rush to judgment, a presumption of guilt.  Television legal commentator, Nancy Grace, vilified those who even considered the possibility that a woman might lie about being a victim of gang rape.  The local prosecutor, too, was taken in.  It took the police and the courts and due process to prove that the rape accusation was a fabrication.  How did we find out it was false?  We found out because the toxicology and forensic evidence disproved the accuser's claims.  We found out because there was transparency and professional evidence gathering and procedural fairness.  Had the accuser reported only to school authorities, and had that case been tried on campus behind closed doors, it's a good bet that those lacrosse players would have been promptly expelled and had their lives ruined with no way to vindicate themselves. But that case happened in 2007 before all this stuff got going, so that's not what happened.  Students were lucky.  Their case went to court.  Now, I'm not saying that such cases happen every day.  And I'm not saying our courts are perfect or our police are perfect.  We've got to do better.  We have to encourage these cases to go to court through the police to get justice.  I would just ask you to bear that kind of case in mind tonight when you vote on the resolution that courts should be the place where rape cases are tried.\"]\n",
      "[\"They feel very personally about it. It's also very political for them. And it's also about the institutions that they inhabit, so that's a recipe for very strong feelings and very strong disagreements.\", 'I think it\\'s important for us to see that tonight\\'s debate is not just about courts versus campuses. And it\\'s not just about sexual assault. It is a debate about the equality of men and women in our society. In college, I was a rape counselor and an activist, and I\\'ve spent my entire life as a feminist on campuses. I have a daughter and a son. And I was optimistic to see colleges take sexual assault more seriously than they had in the past. But the disaster we have seen unfolding around us has made me lose faith. My points tonight will focus on fairness, process, and the connection to equality. What campuses are doing under pressure from the Department of Education is hurting the cause of gender equality. Campus tribunals use procedures that lack basic fairness and often reach inaccurate outcomes. What happens? You\\'re told there\\'s a sexual misconduct complaint against you. But they don\\'t say what it\\'s about or show you the complaint. They don\\'t tell you the evidence or the facts that they\\'re gathering, who the witnesses are, or what they\\'ve said. If you\\'re allowed to bring an attorney, which you might not be, your lawyer is barred from speaking. If they give you a live hearing, which they may not, you can\\'t question the accuser or witnesses. People who weren\\'t even there are asked to give opinions on what happened. Terribly leading questions are asked. And when your attorney objects, she is told that if she speaks again, she\\'ll be ejected. After you\\'re found responsible and suspended, they don\\'t give you a copy of the investigative report, saying that they can\\'t because of student privacy. The investigation and the adjudication may be handled by the same person, and the appeal is to that person\\'s boss. So, everyone is invested in defending the previous actions of the school. When you appeal, you\\'re told you can\\'t challenge the panel\\'s factual findings. And all this is happening because if you\\'re not found guilty, the school fears that the Department of Education will open an investigation that would cost a lot of money to deal with and jeopardize its federal funding. In just the past three months, no fewer than five different courts have ruled for students on claims that their school used unfair procedures, including things that I\\'ve just described. The shocking disregard for what Americans know are essentials of fair process deeply harms the cause of taking sexual violence seriously. It reinforces society\\'s skepticism toward rape victims. It causes everyone to doubt that men disciplined for sexual assault are actually guilty. That aggravates the serious problem that we all want to address. And it harms the fight for gender equality. To make matters worse, many schools are now stretching the concept of what sexual assault is far beyond reasonable recognition. If you have sexual contact without an explicit agreement for every stage of a sexual interaction, that might be considered non-consensual. It\\'s a great idea to make sure that each partner is excited about going forward, but move from kissing to touching without pausing for an explicit agreement -- and it can be sexual assault, even if the other person is equally participating in it. Some schools even define consent to mean not only affirmative, but enthusiastic -- even \"creative\" and \"imaginative\" agreement. It may be funny, but anything else is sexual assault. It\\'s obvious that sex with a person incapacitated by alcohol is rape. That is obvious. But schools are now disciplining students when the sexual contact is under the influence of alcohol. All this means that most sexual encounters are violating the rules. So, when one person is kicked out for this and branded a rapist, it feels arbitrary to both men and to women. It is truly bizarre to lump these cases together with rapes and treat them as sexual assaults. Yet, these are most of the cases that colleges are adjudicating today. This came about because of a desire to protect women from coercion. The idea was that men should seek permission, not just wait for women to object to sex. But schools are sending all the wrong messages about women\\'s capacity to be equal, mature, and independent. We can date these ideas to about 1880. Women are timid; women are fragile. In the name of protecting college women and making campuses safe, schools are signaling loudly that they do not see women as capable.  I don\\'t want my daughter educated to think of herself that way.  We need to refocus on what\\'s wrong with sexual violence and refuse these ancient ideas of women\\'s incapacity. Watered-down procedures and overly broad definitions of non-consent make a mockery of a very serious problem and dishonor victims.  Our opponents must convince you that a rape on campus is different from a rape anywhere else.  It is not.  Criminal sexual conduct anywhere deserves criminal response.  And our opponents want you to accept that a civil rights option means that it\\'s okay to have lesser procedures.  Even if the stakes were civil, the process must be fair, and the stakes are effectively criminal.  There is, in fact, so much that campuses should do.  It\\'s disturbing to see the bulk of resources going to pseudo investigations and trials.  Schools should direct those resources to working with law enforcement.  The safety measures that Michelle was talking about, those do not necessarily go hand in hand with an investigation and adjudication, a decision about the responsibility and guilt of a party for committing a crime. You can take safety measures, and campuses do all the time, without having pseudo criminal trials.  Schools can engage in rape education, they can address alcohol consumption, and they can work hard to support victims.  The answer to shame or stigma about sexual assault is not a campus tribunal mired in secrecy and severe conflicts of interest that is the confidence of nobody.  We\\'re going to look back on this period as a mass panic when many people together lost their ability to think clearly about sexual assault and squandered opportunities for promoting gender equality.  Campuses should not do shoddily what our courts have been designed over generations to do; decide questions of responsibility and guilt for a crime based on evidence. You should not accept it.  You should vote for the motion.  Courts, not campuses should decide sexual assault cases.', \"Yes, those are real things in terms of moving class schedules and dorm arrangements.  Actually, colleges are doing that even before the adjudication investigations are completed. That shows you that colleges feel empowered to just do that for the sake of student safety or just to preserve good relations in the dorm or for the -- just in the best interests of the students who are involved.  They have all kinds of reasons to do things, like, say, you can't go to this dorm, you have to move, and I think that, that shows you it's not connected to whether the college is then going to have a -- an investigation, a trial, a tribunal, and go through that whole --\", 'I think there are lots of different ways to make decisions.  I think there are decisions made for all kinds of reasons.  One -- the decision that we\\'re talking about in this debate, decide sexual assault cases, is a determination of responsibility and guilt for what could be a crime.  People do have disputes, like you\\'re talking about, in their dorms.  They do go to their resident advisor and say, \"I\\'m having a problem,\" and sometimes they\\'re brought in to have a mediation, to have a talk, to resolve, and they could -- colleges can advise and guide.  And actually the Department of Education says, when it comes to the sexual misconduct matters, that\\'s not even allowed. You have to go through some kind adjudicative process to decide the guilt of the party.', \"It is not in any way the exception.  The -- if you talk to people who are involved in this field -- and I myself have participated in and witnessed some of these things that I was talking about -- it is not in any way the exception.  And it is -- and it's good.  I agree with Stephen that the courts have noticed and said, this is not okay.  The conflicts of interest, though, that we're talking about are not just one-off conflicts of interest.  We're talking about structural conflict of interest, where we're talking about a Title IX officer who is charged with compliance with the Department of Education's dictates.  And they are terrified about what's going to happen if they don't find a certain way, they don't do things a certain way.  And how can that really lead to a neutral decision about the guilt or innocence of the party before them when they're thinking, oh, my God, am I going to have -- my school have funding taken away? Or even if they're not ultimately going to have funding taken away, if, say --\", \"-- if their is an investigation against the school, then that's going to cost a hundred -- several hundred thousand dollars to even just deal with, even if at the end of the day.  So when you're thinking like that, how can you be neutral about the guilt or innocence or about the facts of what happened?\", 'So I have prosecuted that case here in Manhattan.  There were people being groped every day in Times Square.  And it is incorrect, as was suggested earlier --', 'Yeah.', 'Yes, exactly.  So that -- that\\'s a crime just like it was in -- if it was in Times Square, it\\'s a crime.  And if it happens in a chemistry lab, it\\'s also a crime.  At that point, like any victim, this victim has the discretion whether to report to the police or not to the police. Many of us have been victims of crimes.  Many of us have made a decision whether what -- whatever kind of crime it was, whether it was worth it to us to pursue the crime or not. I think that would be the situation for that victim.  And she -- in my opinion, if I were her advisor, I would say, \"Go to the police because this is a crime, and a crime has been committed against you, the person will be arrested.\"', 'Well, if we were living in a reasonable world with a reasonable department of education, what would actually happen, what could happen is the possibility that short of an -- a police-like investigation and a law-like court type of tribunal, you would have some reasonable parties get involved, talk to the people, and say, you know, \"What\\'s going on here?  This is not acceptable.  Bad, bad, bad person.  Don\\'t do that.  Don\\'t do it anymore.\"  And, you know, as Stephen suggested, these are adolescents with raging hormones and exercising bad judgment.  There are some cases like that.  But what Jed was talking about was serious cases of rape and sexual assault. Now, \"sexual assault\" is an ambiguous term because it includes rape and in some jurisdictions it includes other things.  In other jurisdictions, sexual assault is separate from rape.  So there\\'s a little bit of an ambiguity about what we\\'re talking about.  But what we are talking about essentially is serious crimes involving sex such as rape.', \"I think there's a ton to learn.\", 'So in -- if this happened in the workplace, the federal law called Title VII would provide a way for that person to sue their employer for failing to prevent or to address a hostile work environment.  Now, Title IX also is a law that one could use to sue ones school for failing to address a hostile environment. Now, there are many ways to address a hostile environment.  Do they all involve an investigation and an adjudication and a kind of tribunal like that?  No.  There are many ways to do the work that an educational institution, consistent with this pedagogical mission, to educate its students, to nurture them, to promote a kind of culture where sexual harassment is not considered acceptable. [applause]', \"I think that they can get safety through -- if we didn't have these tribunals, they would have safety through the school's reasonable measures that they could take, that they take all the time. They take them even without going through the tribunals.  They just impose them, depending on their individualized assessment of what the safety of the campus requires.  That does not mean what we need is a system, a shadow justice system that is operating in schools.  And so there are many options for schools to undertake to provide for victim support.  And they could be even doing a better job if they weren't so focused on this quasi punitive system.\", \"I think that it is clear that the idea that schools are more interested in justice for victims, that they're more interested in their well-being, that they're more interested in the correct outcomes, that is absurd.  Schools are entrenched in conflicts of interest, in all kinds of problems, in different loyalties to different entities, to alumni, to their current students, different political forces. And our court system, hey, it's really flawed.  We know that.  But that is what it's designed to do, to try to sort -- [bell rings] Jeannie Suk: -- these out.\", \"Let me close by sharing with you a worry that we haven't really talked about yet tonight.  The trampling of fair process, which we see all over on campuses, should give us concern about the disproportionate impact on students of color.  I have personally seen time and again allegations arising from the kinds of cases I was talking about, the ambivalence, the ambiguity, or misunderstanding about consent.  They fall on minorities and poor students.  And many others working on these cases have told me that this is a campus secret nobody wants to talk about.  Think about a nontransparent campus process as opposed to a transparent public hearing, without procedural safeguard, behind closed doors where unconscious bias can flourish. These are perfect conditions for biases and fears to reach inaccurate outcomes.  One college administrator told me that what keeps him up at night is panic that his school could be one Department of Education investigation away from institutional death.  That makes it impossible for him to consider what's fair and what's right.  Campuses must respond to sexual assault.  The vote tonight though asks you to say whether shadow campus rape tribunals to decide responsibility and guilt are a solution.  Colleges have lost their way because of the impossible position -- and we covered that tonight -- the impossible position that the federal government has put schools in. I am sure officials from the Department of Education know about tonight's debate. And school administrators are watching too. You have the chance to send a message about how you feel about these tribunals that have been generated under this kind of fear. Vote for the motion, not just because you care about fairness and process, but because you care about victims and about safety, and about effective responses to sexual assault.\"]\n",

      "[\"No more doubt on my mind on his views than on Justice Ginsburg's views on the case. [laughter]\", \"My partner is Sherif Girgis, and he's an Ivy League-educated expert on the institution of marriage.\", 'Thank you very much.  I, too, am delighted to be here and to participate in this debate with such esteemed colleagues.  In the brief that Evan Wolfson filed in the Supreme Court in the marriage case that\\'s currently being heard there, he repeated over and over again, \"The real definition of equal protection is -- comes to us from Supreme Court precedent.  It\\'s not a requirement that everybody be treated equally no matter what the circumstances, it\\'s that all persons who are similarly situated shall be treated alike.\"  And he repeats this over and over again. On page seven on the brief the operative presumption is that the legislature has presumably permissively determined that the persons affected by a classification are not similarly situated in the first place.  The real question for us is whether the Equal Protection Clause require us to understand or to adopt one version of marriage by which everybody agrees people are similarly situated. If the institution of marriage is simply about the loving relationships between adults and the dignity that the state might confer on that relationship, then there\\'s no reason to distinguish one set of relationships from another.  But if marriage is about something different than that, if it\\'s about that unique biological complementarity of men and women structured in a institution that gives life to the offspring of that relationship, then it\\'s quite obvious that same-sex and opposite-sex couples are not similarly situated.  And it doesn\\'t violate Equal Protection not to treat groups who are not similarly situated differently.  That\\'s the real question for us, what is the very purpose of marriage therefore? Is it for the state to confer a dignity, to recognize this adult relationship, as Evan has claimed?  Or is it something else, something much more profound?  Why is it that every society in human history, across cultures and ages, have adopted something very similar to the man/woman understanding of marriage that we\\'re talking about today? It\\'s because there\\'s something inherent in the nature of men and women, and that function that they alone can provide that is essential to the marital relationship and to the creation of the next generation.  When the Supreme Court 14 times in its cases has talked about marriage as a fundamental right, it has always been in the context of that basic understanding.  In Loving v. Virginia, it went on in the sentence after the one Evan quoted to say because it\\'s necessary -- it\\'s essential to our very existence and survival. That\\'s not true if you remove from that purpose of the institution this unique procreative ability of men and women. So, what is the purpose of marriage?  What is the state\\'s interest or reason for getting involved in the institution of marriage at all?  There are all sorts of relationships that the state doesn\\'t have anything to say about: friendships, brother-sister relationships, mother-father, cousins, all sorts of relationships.  The state has no interest in getting it -- even if they\\'re very loving relationships, even if they\\'re romantically loving relationships. That\\'s not why the state got in the marriage business in the first place, and why it is the third party in every marriage contract.  It\\'s this unique procreative ability of men and women.  And the third is, if we\\'re going to radically redefine that purpose to be about adults rather than that child-centered focus, who decides that question?  Well, in our society, in almost every case, the Constitution does not settle those questions.  It leaves it up to the people to decide.  And that\\'s the real question we have here. Has this constitutional provision adopted in 1868 already decided this question for us, and said, \"You know, you people, you don\\'t get to decide this question.\" We\\'re not talking about discriminating against a group of people.  That the Constitution has decided.  We\\'re talking about redefining a core societal institution to be a dramatically different purpose than it has ever had before.  That question the Constitution doesn\\'t decide.  And it\\'s that question that we have to answer on the get-go. So, we\\'ve got a lot of history here to try and figure out what exactly this purpose of marriage is.  You go all the way back to California cases -- I\\'m from California, so I\\'ll start with some there -- 100 years ago, we had this clear.  The first purpose of matrimony, by the laws of nature and society, is procreation.  And then 100 years later it shows it hasn\\'t changed.  The sexual procreative and child-rearing aspects of marriage go to the very essence of the marital relation.  Justice Kennedy, in his opening of his opinion in the Windsor case, striking down the Defense of Marriage Act just two years ago, he says this at the very beginning: \"For marriage between a man and a woman, no doubt it\\'s been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition of that term.  And to its role and function throughout the history of civilization.\" Those are the questions -- those -- that\\'s what we understand marriage to be.  And it takes a radical redefinition of it, a change in its core purpose, to create -- to create an equality of claim here. And it\\'s that change in purpose that raises a lot of concerns and raises the state interest about not changing this. So, what happens if we just change the institution of marriage?  Well, we\\'ve got an experiment with this.  50 years ago, we changed another core aspect of marriage -- the norm of its permanence.  We did it by adopting no-fault divorce laws.  We said, you know, if things hit a bump in the road, you can get out of your marriage a lot easier than you could. Everybody said at the time \"It won\\'t affect the institution of marriage.  It won\\'t alter your marriage.\" But what we\\'ve seen over those 50 years is a dramatic reduction in the societal norms the -- the incentive that the institutional understanding, the definitional understanding provided. People no longer -- in many instances -- think that marriage is a life-long commitment. \"It\\'s a life-long commitment unless I hit bumps on the road, ceases to be in the way of my adult fulfillment, and then I get out of it.\" That little shift changed it from a child- centered institution to an adult-centered institution. And it has had dramatic consequences.  Well, we\\'re now talking about a shift that\\'s even more profound, to remove the gender complementarity, the gender diversity in the raising of children -- all of those things -- to make this more about the adult relationship than the child who are the offspring of that man-woman union -- is going to dramatically reduce the incentives that that institution provides as a cultural norms -- cultural --', 'Sorry.', 'I ran out of time. I wasnt watching.', '-- very much.', \"Yeah, I do.  Look, because the test the Supreme Court has developed for addressing these equal protection questions is whether the groups are similarly situated, you have to be adopting a view of marriage in which the groups are similarly situated to make that claim.  And you necessarily have to be rejecting the view of marriage in which the groups are quite obviously not similarly situated.  And it's that change in the understanding of the purpose of the institution of marriage that requires us to treat this as a new claim rather than just access to the existing institution.\", 'Yeah.  So -- any two adult relationships are similarly situated if the purpose of the relationship is to foster the love and commitment between the relationships.  And if that\\'s what the purpose of marriage was, then I would say it violates equal protection not to extend same-sex marriage to -- or not to extend marriage to same-sex couples, to polyamorous or polygamous couples, to consenting adults in familiar relationship of all sorts. If instead the purpose is this unique biological complementarity of men and women that bring men and women together for the purpose of producing the children that are the result of that union, then two men are not capable of having -- women, you\\'re saying you\\'re fertile, that\\'s right, but not -- you know, Kenji says at some point in his book, \"To say that only men can be fathers and only women can be mothers is to engage in sex stereotyping.\"  No, it\\'s not.  It goes to the very essence of the difference between men and women on this core biological purpose.', 'No, you can give me the question.  Ill figure out a way to respond --', \"Well, so -- so it requires us so have a rethinking about the purpose.  And Evan has done a very nice job in turning this to why adults enter into the institution of marriage.  That's not the relevant question.  The question is, why did the state get involved in the marriage business in the first place.  And that has nothing to do with, it lays its hands on and gives my dignity because they've given me a marriage license or it sanctions my adult relationship. The state has no interest or business, quite frankly, in getting involved in the institution of marriage for those purposes.  It's this unique procreative ability that does it.  And that's -- you know, and you go back to the Greeks and every -- it's not just the Greeks and the Romans, it's every society in human history that's come up with the same thing. The leading anthropologist, Claude Levi Strauss, the family, based on a union more or less durable, but socially --\", \"Because the question is, in order to treat them as an equal protection violation, we have to assume that the groups are similarly situated.  That then requires that I answer a question that the Constitution does not answer:  Which view of marriage are we going to have; this adult-centric consent view or the long-standing conjugal view? That question is not answered in the Constitution.  And only if you answer that question on the former is it a violation of equal protection.  And that's -- and who decides that question I think is the real critical one.\", 'Yeah, so look, couple of --', \"-- look, a couple of things, one, we don't have any evidence yet one way or the other whether issuing a marriage license itself to adoptive parents to same-sex parents has any effect on the upbringing of their children.  What we do know is when it's -- when you move away from both biological parents, the increased risk to serious emotional and development problems to the children more than doubles.  That's true whether the parents are same sex.  It's true whether the parents are opposite sex.  It's true when you have one lacking in the biological connection. And so if you take that -- and the most comprehensive dataset we have is from the Centers for Disease Control that demonstrates -- you go from 7 percent to 17 1/2 percent risk to the kids when both biological parents are not involved.  Now if that means there are 82 percent in non-biological parent households, the kids are doing just fine. But that differential is significant.  It's significant for the state's reason in getting involved in the marriage business in the first place.  And when you alter the understanding of marriage that discourages a significant number of people who are the biological parents of that child from entering into that relationship and that institution for raising that child, you cause pretty catastrophic harms to kids.  And that's why the state has a fundamental interest here in not weakening that institutional draw that every society in human history is settled on for the best way to encourage that relationship and that structure.\", 'So the same question.  The state\\'s interests -- we\\'re not looking at any individual case, but institutionally.  And if I create an institution where I encourage people to enter in that institution who have the unique capability of creating children through their own sexual relations in a way that no other relationship has, the state has an interest in encouraging as many of those people as they can in the institution of marriage, and that\\'s why we preside -- we provide all sorts of incentives, including benefits to that. Now, I suppose I could get more perfect in my drawing of the line.  I could have some government dictate out there and say, \"I\\'m going to -- I\\'m going to come by your house every Thursday night to make sure you\\'re having sexual relations.\" I could do all sorts of things, but we know for a fact that when men and women have sexual relations, they tend to have kids whether by on purpose or accident.  It\\'s a result of that conduct.  It\\'s part of the nature of the relationship.  And that\\'s why we create the institution to channel that unique ability there.  And if I alter that and I say, \"This is all about the parents -- the loving relationship between the parents,\" I have undermined the reason the state got involved in the business in the first place, and I\\'ve weakened the institutional draw.  Let me just -- you know --', \"--sorry, yeah, I -- filibuster.  It's -- [laughter]\", \"John, we've offered lots of rationales.  You disagree with them or don't like them, but that doesn't mean they're perfectly valid rationales.  Heres what was said when the North Carolina statute was proposed. Moms and dads are not interchangeable.  Two men do not make a mom, two moms do not make a dad.  Children need both a mother and a father.  Now, I'm going to quote that other real radical conservative on the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg in the VMI caseProfessor Yoshino [unintelligible] earlier, physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring.  The two sexes are not fungible.  A community made up exclusively of one sex is different from a community composed of both.  That's the critical understanding, this natural understanding of marriage, that it brings together the unique biological, rooted in nature complementarity of men and women for a purpose that is different than all of the collateral purposes we often assign to marriage. But the states' interest in furthering that institution for that purpose is why we are here and [unintelligible].\", \"It's completely irrelevant whether I think gay sex and heterosexual sex are on a moral, similar plane or not, it's irrelevant to the --\", \"It's completely irrelevant to the Constitutional question. As it was, to what 6 million or 7 million Californians voted who voted for Proposition 8 thought about that question.  The issue is under rational basis review, Professor Yoshino, as you under -- know the issue is whether there is any plausible explanation that is it rational.  We have offered several, which you have not rebutted.  And under rational basis review, that is more than sufficient.  And, quite frankly, because of the compelling interest that the state has in fostering this bond, it meets heightened scrutiny as well.\", \"It's completely irrelevant.\", \"You can press it all you want.  It's completely irrelevant to the Constitutional question.\", \"It's not going to get --\", 'So 50 years ago, legislatively, we changed one of the core aspects of marriage with no fault divorce, and that\\'s had pretty dramatic consequences.  If you change an institution, you\\'re necessarily going to change that institutions norm-inducing behavior.  In 2012, the European court of human rights said that the European convention of human rights, their Constitution does not require member state governments to grant same-sex couples access to marriage.  And yet just last week Ireland voters chose to do that. What we\\'re asking here is that the same thing applies in our Constitution.  It doesn\\'t settle this question. The question ought to be up to the voters on whether we\\'re going to embark upon such a fundamental retransformation of the very purpose of the institution of marriage. Justice Kennedy himself, a year ago, said that \"the respondents in this case,\" in a different case, \"insist that a difficult question of public policy must be taken from the reach of the voters.\"  That is inconsistent with the underlying premises of a responsible, functioning government.  He went further.  He said, it\\'s demeaning to the democratic process to presume that voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds. He says, \"Freedom embraces the right, indeed the duty, to engage in a rational civil discourse --\" we\\'ve had one tonight \"-- in order to determine how best to form a consensus to shape the destiny of the nation and its people.\"  If we settle this through the normal political means, we will all have a much greater stake in the resolution than if its imposed on us by the court.  Abraham Lincoln, in his first inaugural address said -- addressed that point. A candid citizen must confess that the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court the instant they are made an ordinary litigation between parties and personal actions. The people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.  The Constitution doesn\\'t settle this question.  We ought to let, \"We, the people,\" do it.']\n",
      "['Right.  Actually, I grew up mostly in Delaware, which, in other parts of the country, is a conversation-stopper. [laughter]', \"That's true.  Yeah.  The first ones to sign on to the Constitution.  We had nothing to lose. [laughter]\", \"Well, thank you.  And first I want to say it's a huge honor to be speaking opposite these really distinguished guests.  I mean, Evan Wolfson, as they said, is the architect of the movement for same-sex marriage.  He's a remarkable visionary and leader whatever you think of the substance of the issue.  And Kenji Yoshino it rightly regarded, including by lots of my conservative friends, as one of the best teachers in the legal academy and certainly one of the best writers.  I think you'll see all of that on display tonight. And it would worry me, except that I think that you can be fully onboard with their view of same-sex marriage as a policy matter and still agree with us that it's one of those very important policies where the Constitution's just silent.  It leaves you free to pick.  And the reason, in a nutshell -- and I'm going to be focusing on big picture in this part -- is that the Equal Protection Clause is not enough.  It says don't be arbitrary. So have a reasonable vision of what marriage is and of its public purposes and apply it equally, not arbitrarily.  It doesn't tell you what vision of marriage to adopt.  But that's what this whole debate is exactly about.  Do we adopt the consent-based view of marriage that says it's fundamentally about deep romantic love and commitment and that the reasons to recognize it are stability and dignity, in which case, yes, recognizing that equally requires recognizing same-sex relationships. Or do we have a different vision of marriage?  The more traditional vision in our law, the conjugal view of marriage that says marriage is fundamentally about that union in which a man and a woman are coming together and oriented to family life by the very nature of the bond, the act that makes marital love is the kind of act that makes new life.  The only relationship that can give kids a shot at being reared by their own mother and father. The problems for the other side in this particular debate are that the Constitution doesn't tell you which of those views to adopt, and there's nothing inherently wrong with the conjugal view.  And they're going to say that's not true.  That last part's not right.  The only way you could make your way to the conjugal view is if you were motivated by animus.  I think this is one of the easiest parts of the argument to solve, and I'd be interested to see if they have a response to it.  History disproves this.  This isn't the only way you can get to this view. In fact, there have been cultures that span the spectrum of attitudes towards homosexuality and still have the conjugal view of marriage in their law, cultures that we're perfectly aware of and celebrated long-term same-sex relationships -- in ancient Greece in various forms, for example -- but still thought it had nothing to do with marriage; cultures that were totally ignorant of our concept of gay identity.  They didn't even know of the class in the way that we do today, to have animus against it.  Couldn't have been motivated by animus. They might say, well, maybe the view itself isn't motivated by animus, but the idea that same-sex marriage has anything to do with linking kids to their own mom and dad does. It's unreasonable.  There's no link.  And the problem with that view is that even some prominent same-sex marriage supporters reject it or reject something very close it.  So, for example, E.J. Graff says, of course, ideas have consequences.  Changing our idea of marriage is going to have consequences for marriage, practice.  And he says, in particular, it will be breathtakingly subversive to recognize gay marriage.  It will introduce a revolt against the institution to its very heart, forever cutting the link between it and diapers. Andrew Sullivan says, of course, it's going to liberate us from not just complementarity but lots of other patriarchal or oppressive norms that restrict the personality, like sexual exclusivity, norms that were tailor-made for opposite-sex relationships. Masha Gessen, a same-sex marriage advocate said it's a no-brainer that the institution of marriage shouldn't exist and that this is a stepping stone to its deinstitutionalization. They all agree that sexual complementarity, the idea of a man and woman coming together as mother and father to their kids and marriage law historically are all linked together.  They just disagree on whether it's good or bad to delink them.  So whatever you think of that view, you might reject it. But it can't be motivated by irrationality.  And maybe someone will say, well okay, so the case law makes it clear that we can't have this vision of marriage.  Professor Yoshino sometimes points to Turner that says, look, you don't lose your marriage rights when you enter a prison because after all you can have things like emotional commitment. And Professor Yoshino will say, well, there we go.  That's the revision, the consent-based view being enshrined in our case law. But just two lines down it talks about the expectation of ex- -- of consummation.  It talks about the legitimation of children born into the union. It's clearly taking for granted the conjugal view that had always been the law and just saying, apply that equally.  That's the pattern for all the cases that he has brought up in his own writings.  The last thing might be this:  Well, it just imposes a separate status, a disadvantage and so a stigma that's Justice Kennedy's words about DOMA.  Maybe that's the problem, just excluding same-sex relationships is all.  That's directly a violation of equality.  You don't have to go to all this stuff about picking views and which one's based on what reasons. And the only problem with that view is that if it works against this vision of marriage, it works against all of them.  Every marriage law creates a separate status.  The whole question is where to draw the lines and do we have a reason for drawing them where we do?  Does it make sense?  Does it serve any public interest?  Nothing our opponents tonight will say -- can say will undermine the idea that there may be -- that it's reasonable at least -- whether you agree with it or not, to think that it's worth preferring biological parenting wherever possible, giving kids their best shot at it by using our marriage law unobtrusively to do that and leaving other adults to live and love the lives of their choice. Thank you.\", 'No.  I mean, of course it\\'s a new right.  I mean, it\\'s basically changing the understanding of marriage in order to say that same-sex couples are similarly situated.  I mean -- so the answer to Professor Yoshino\\'s question is of course the Equal Protection Clause applies to everybody.  If a gay person walking into this building -- is this a state-run institution -- if it were and a gay person were charged one cent more, however trivial the cost, that\\'s an Equal Protection violation.  That\\'s not what we\\'re talking about.  That just basically runs right over the question of what marriage is.  And here\\'s a clear way to put it.  I want to know by what principle Professor Yoshino or Evan Wolfson would say, \"Look, if someone says to you\" -- and there are people who say this now -- \"\\'There are three of us, we\\'re three men, we\\'ve thrown our lot in for the long haul, we\\'re committed to it through thick and thin\\' -- \" and here\\'s why, it\\'s not because -- you say, \"Oh, well, it\\'s perfectly substituted. You can settle for one.\"  They say, \"No, for our identity.\"  That doesn\\'t work.  It\\'s not the most fulfilling bond.  Surely the principle is recognition of the relationship in which you find most personal fulfillment.  We don\\'t want to be stigmatized.  We don\\'t want our kids stigmatized.  We\\'ve been forced into the closet partly because of the gay marriage progress, because we\\'re an embarrassment to the movement, but now we want our turn.  What is the answer to that?  [unintelligible] commitment --', \"It wasn't an evasion, actually.  I just wanted to come to this point.\", 'Here\\'s what I was saying.  I was saying you have a principle by which you say whether people are being excluded unfairly or not.  Now, we can just name our principle, we can pick it out of a hat.  Then, of course, we could win by stipulation.  I could say, \"Well, my principle is any man and woman as long as one of them has freckles. And of course we would laugh at them and we can say, \"Oh, go apply it equally.\" I\\'m asking you why your vision isn\\'t arbitrary compared to this better one.  Not the one person --', '-- I find most [inaudible] --', 'But the relationship --', 'Well, I would say a couple of things about it.  First of all, you know, you disparaged the Greeks and the Romans earlier.  The reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to Judaism or Christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage -- the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven\\'t been able to answer, which is, \"How did that come about?\" There wasn\\'t religion or it wasn\\'t bigotry. And now, there are -- what Professor Yoshino\\'s question shows is that there are ways to describe any view that make it look less plausible.  But I can do that from a revisionist view, too.  I can say, \"What\\'s the -- when two men throw their lot in together, and do it for the long haul, and share all the burdens and benefits of common-law [unintelligible] -- what\\'s so special about whether -- what brought them together is that they\\'re two brothers or two best friends, or what brought them together is climax? What\\'s so morally significant about orgasm?\" There\\'s a way of describing the views that denigrates it, but that wouldn\\'t be fair to Professor Yoshino, and it wouldn\\'t be fair to mine either.  Let me just take one dimension of the questions that he brought.  He said, \"How can two men not have a bodily union?\" Well, here\\'s the question.  Why is sex integral to bodily union?  Everybody in the debate agrees that somehow, if it\\'s just about fostering and expressing affection, and vulnerability, and tenderness, than other activities can do that.  And yet, in the book, we develop an Aristotelian account, where it\\'s about coordinated action towards a single, common end that completes and encompasses them both.  And that\\'s why the kind of union that a man and a woman can have is different in that respect.', 'I do, yes.  A couple -- there are a couple points in there.  So, first of all, the interracial marriage thing is a red herring.  Do you know where the first place in the world that interracial marriage first came up?  It was in the colonial United States.  Nancy Cott says this.  Why?  Because that was a regime of slavery.  It was clearly -- now, you look at the history, it\\'s impossible to conclude that it was about anything about oppressing marriages.  To believe that there\\'s an analogy here, you would have to believe that biological parenting -- thinking that that matters is on par with thinking that your skin color matters. And Justice Sotomayor herself has written, in a recent case, \"It\\'s a principle recognized in our cases that the biological bond between a parent and child is meaningful.\"  She would never say the same thing about racial purity which is the language of these -- while a second thing, on the idea that this isn\\'t something new, here\\'s a quote. \"Enlarging the concept to embrace same-sex couples would necessarily transform the institution into something new.\" That is Bill Eskridge, one of the pioneer legal scholars in favor of same-sex marriage and gay rights for 25 years admitting the plain fact and just saying it\\'s a good idea.  Now, on the last point, of course, no matter what your marriage policy is, [unintelligible] artificial reproductive technology [unintelligible], no matter what your policy is, there will be households in which kids are being reared without a marriage at the head of the household on their vision as well.  But they want to smuggle this off stage to say that that consideration just for same-sex couples requires just extending it to marriage.  I say if there are concrete needs that are arise wherever kids are in a home, you need to make a policy available wherever kids are in a home, whether it\\'s a mom and her mom who moved in to help her raise the kid because she\\'s a single mom, which is the most common kind of same-sex parent-led household or otherwise.', \"I think the Constitution, from the moment the 14th Amendment was passed, was big enough to say that interracial marriage is a fundamental right.  At every step of the way, they have to allide over the difference between seeing marriage as a romantic bond where the other connections are by case-by-case, optional, by choice -- in which case, by the way, it does -- it's not very clear why it has to still be linked to romances.  If two people who aren't romantically interested in each other, or if a single mom has her sister move in to raise the kids together, have they made their relationship oriented to family life?  I mean, it goes back to this question, you know, the interests -- does the state interests change when the two adults aren't in a romantic bond? So, I think their vision can't explain any of these connections, but I have to allide over it, whereas the interracial marriage thing is straightforward.  There's no way of reading the history and thinking this wasn't fundamentally about keeping blacks and whites apart, to keep the whites on top.  And the court itself said that.  Here by contrast, again, it's impossible to look at the history and think the only purpose is to oppress gay people.\", 'Well, I think love and companionship and commitment and mutual care are valuable in themselves wherever they show up.  Here\\'s a quote.  \"I understood marriage as the rare place where law and love converge.\" That\\'s from Professor Yoshino\\'s lyrical account of his own story in conjunction with a policy case for same-sex marriages, which is what his book on Prop 8 is.  It\\'s giving you reasons for that policy.  Now, here\\'s another quote and another view.  \"I\\'ve never been fully out as poly.  I have to live knowing that someone I love thinks that if her mother knew that she has a second partner no love and support her, take care of her kids, it might lead to shaming and rejection.\"  Some people\\'s innate personality means they would never feel emotionally satisfied in a monogamous relationship any more than a gay man would in a straight marriage.  That\\'s from Michael Kerry who had to write under a pseudonym in Slate. Now, maybe Professor Yoshino wants to say that if he\\'s against polyamory, it must mean that he thinks these are sinners.  I doubt that.  It doesn\\'t make any sense as an inference.  They also want you to squint at the Constitution and see that the Constitution requires ratifying Professor Yoshino\\'s view in his book but somehow leaves this one out in the cold.  I don\\'t see that, either.  They\\'re both policy debates.  Here\\'s a third view. A woman who -- this is from a woman who grew up in a gay welcoming community by her own lights with two moms.  She said, \"I have a few fuzzy memories of my father\\'s unfamiliar voice wishing me a happy birthday.  Wonderful memories with my two mothers.  But one need they couldn\\'t meet was for a father, not because they weren\\'t good enough parents.  I love a man I don\\'t even know who, by all counts, is a lousy father.  I ached for him to love me.  Promoting same-sex parenting guarantees that a child will miss out on her mother or father.\"  That\\'s Heather Barwick writing to the Supreme Court in this case. Look, we\\'re not telling you any of these is immoral or moral.  We\\'re not telling you that any of them is off the table, but they are.  They\\'re saying that somehow the Constitution rules Heather\\'s voice out of this conversation, and we\\'re saying it treats all of them on a par.']\n",

      "['New light, John, I can.  After many, many rounds, more than I can remember, of difficult contentious negotiations, I can share with you the insight that people that havent slept for five or six days at a stretch get very irritable -- [laughter] -- of all nationalities.', 'Just before coming here.', 'Hopefully Im not irritable.', 'Yeah, my partner is one of Americas finest and most experienced diplomats, Ambassador Tom Pickering.', 'All right.  Thanks very much, everybody.  Thanks for coming.  Im really pleased to be here and honored to be joined on my side of the debate by Tom Pickering.  Also glad to be up here with Mark and Mike.  They play an important role.  We disagree on this subject, but they play an important role in what is a really important debate.  Let me get straight to the point.  Tom and I are going to argue that the Iran deal of President Obama is good for America for three basic reasons. One, its important for the United States to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Two, this deal effectively does that, and it does it while avoiding a costly and unpredictable conflict.  And three, the alternatives to this deal -- the alternatives to this deal are far worse.  And Im going to ask you to pay particular attention to this third point, because I suspect our opponents in this debate will spend a considerable amount of time telling you why this agreement is imperfect and why it should also have X, Y, and Z. What I dont think youll hear them do is present a credible and realistic alternative to it. And I remind you as we start, that the proposition on the table is not, Is this a perfect deal that you would write alone if you didnt have to negotiate it with somebody else? but Is it good for America?  And I think if thats the question, it clearly is.  In fact, I dont even think its much of a close call. The first point, Ill be very brief on.  The United States has an interest in stopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon because an Iran with a nuclear weapon could threaten the region and some of our close allies, including Israel.  It could be a precedent and a stimulant for other countries in the region to develop nuclear weapons.  And it would be harder to deter and contain it in terms of its foreign policy in the region.  I just want that to be clear.  I dont think our opponents disagree with that, so I would just want to stipulate it upfront.  That doesnt require a debate.  It is important for the United States. What we disagree on is whether this deal effectively does that.  And Tom and I will assert that it does, and let me tell you why and why its good for America.  The framework agreement that the Obama Administration negotiated cuts of all of the possible paths for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. Now, in this brief opening statement, this is not the place for a very detailed analysis of every provision in the agreement. I suspect most of you have already read it and are familiar with it.  What I would do is underscore some of what this agreement does.  And I would ask you to think about it in these terms:  Imagine the world before us with the agreement, if we get it finalized and we implement it, and imagine the world without the agreement.  Think about those two alternatives -- alternative worlds for the future and ask yourself which one you want to live in, which one is good for America. I said the deal cuts off all of the possible paths to an Iranian nuclear weapon.  There are three basic paths:  Enriching uranium to be able to use it for a bomb, using plutonium to create a nuclear weapon, or a covert path.  And this agreement stops all of those tracks. On enrichment, what does the agreement do?  With the agreement, Iran would have to take its current stockpile of low enriched uranium, which is around 10,000 kilograms or 12 tons, enough for several nuclear weapons today, as we discussed this, and get rid of 98 percent of it, keep only 300 kilograms. Without it, they could have whatever stockpile they like.  With this agreement, they would have to get rid of two-thirds of their installed centrifuges.  Today they have 20,000 installed centrifuges.  With this agreement, it would have to go down to 6,000, of which only 5,000 could be operating for 10 years.  And they would all have to be the oldest technology, the least efficient.  Without it, they can operate whatever centrifuges they like.  With the agreement, they would have to stop all of their enrichment at an underground facility called Fordow and they could only keep nonoperating centrifuges there.  Without the agreement, they can use Fordow for whatever they like.  With the agreement, Iran couldnt use its more advanced centrifuges to do enrichment for 10 years and would have long-term limits on research and development. Without the agreement, they can do whatever R&D they want and develop more advanced centrifuges very quickly.  With this agreement, Iran could not enrich uranium to 20 percent, the level, if you recall, when the Israeli prime minister was here in New York a couple of years ago, he identified as the most concerning thing.  So if you enrich uranium to 20 percent, its a short step away from 90 percent and the ability to use it for a bomb.  The interim agreement that we negotiated got rid of that 20 percent stockpile, this agreement requires Iran to not enrich at all to 20 percent, closes off all the potential paths to highly enriched uranium for a bomb.  It also closes off the plutonium path.  With the agreement, Iran has to get rid of its current heavy water reactor at a place called Arak and replace it with one that would not produce any weapons-grade plutonium at all.  And it couldnt do any reprocessing.  It has to ship the core out and cant use this site.  Without the agreement, they can finish production of that heavy water reactor and start producing weapons-grade plutonium. Finally, and maybe most importantly, this blocks the covert path.  With this agreement in place, Iran would be bound to accept unprecedented intrusive inspections, forever, with a mechanism for resolving disputes.  We would have access to their entire fuel cycle from the mines and mills of uranium to production sites for centrifuges all the way to the enrichment sites themselves where there would be cameras and inspectors on a regular basis.  Thats what we have if we get this agreement, if we conclude this agreement.  Without this agreement, we dont have any of that, and we have no idea what Iran is up to.  The bottom line of all that, when you put it all together, is Irans breakout timeline, the amount of time it would take them to get enough material for a bomb, goes from around two months, what it is today, to over a year, which our military specialists are confident give us enough time to react if they seek to violate it. I could go on, but you get the bottom line point.  When you compare these two worlds that we could live in with the agreement or without the agreement, clearly, this agreement is good for the United States.  Indeed, I think its not even a close call.  When Tom takes the floor -- Ive made the positive case for this agreement.  When Tom takes the floor, hell be able to talk about some of the reasons why not only is this a good agreement, but all of the potential alternatives to it are much, much worse.  Thank you very much.', 'Yeah.  I will start.  But, frankly, I dont know where to start, given what we heard about this agreement, speaking of Tooth Fairies.  I dont get all of my predictions right.  Im probably wrong most of the time.  But when I stood up there a few minutes ago and predicted that what we wouldnt hear was an alternative path to get somewhere, instead we just hear a litany of the things that we would love to see if we could write it ourselves, I got that prediction right.  And, Mark, I think you misunderstood my challenge.  My challenge wasnt to describe a better deal.  I can describe a better deal, and you did a great job of it.  I love your deal.  Id sign it right now.  I can describe the salary package that Tom would have if he was a billionaire. [laughter] What I cant do is tell him how to get there.  And thats what you didnt tell us, how to get that better deal.', 'Absolutely.', 'Ill say one word on trust.  And I think Mike understood that point on trust, the Denmark analogy.  We dont need this agreement because we trust Iran.  Its precisely because we dont trust them that we need a verifiable agreement with binding restrictions.', 'Well, they have gotten exceedingly modest sanctions relief, access to a small fraction of their money that has been frozen in foreign accounts, which you know very well the Iranian economy is at least $500 billion or a trillion dollars. And getting access to 700 million of their own does not make a significant difference. The PMD [Possible Military Dimensions] point I think is the essential one.  We agree with you that they havent yet come clean on PMD, and that they need to.  What Tom is saying is that there wont be real sanctions relief until they do.  Now, you can assert that thatll never happen, but I think we need to debate -- you know, the proposition on the table is Is this framework good for America?  You can attack some alternative version of the framework, but the one on the table is the one in which they have to come clean on PMD before they get to --', 'So, then, Im just puzzled.  So, Mike is sure that the British, and the French, and the Germans, and the Russians, and the Chinese hate this agreement and think weve given away the store, but the foreign ministers of all those countries have endorsed it, and explained it, and defended it.  Thats a tricky one for me.', 'Sure, the Russians are totally compliant --', '-- [unintelligible] runaway train. [laughter]  [unintelligible]', 'We agree on sanctions, Mark, at least that part of it.  Thats why they agreed to this deal that required them to do so many things that they didnt want to do.  Youre right.  Their economy is on its back.  Its because of the sanctions that we put together, together with our allies.  And thats how we got this deal.', 'Well, one thing thats great about it is Iran stops for 20 years.  So you may not -- it may not be your ideal scenario.  But if Iran doesnt stop for 20 years, then they start tomorrow.  So thats one thing about it.  Secondly, I keep coming back to this, and Im sorry.  You need a deal that you actually get and not one that you would, like I said earlier, write if you only had to write it yourself.  We could have -- of course, Mark, we could do that.  We could go to the Iranians now and say, Youre currently in the doghouse because people dont trust you.  You violated Security Council resolutions, and thats why we need these real commitments, binding commitments from you. But you know what?  Youre going to be the doghouse forever.  You have to accept uniquely -- youre the only country in the world -- you have to accept these binding -- not for 20 years, not for 30 years, but for infinity.  I would submit to you we could do that and we would have a zero chance of getting an agreement, and then wed be right back to what were talking about now.  And so you wont like the 20-year restrictions. You wont have any restrictions and see if you like that much better.', 'But youre -- youre [unintelligible] now for eternity.', 'Last point about it.', 'No, no.  If the agreement says --', 'Well, one last point on sunset, about the 20 years.  This is agreement doesnt say, and we dont believe, that as soon as the restriction is over, whether its 10 years on centrifuges or 20 years on something else, Iran can do whatever it wants and get in a nuclear weapon.  Whenever these phases end, and in many cases, 15 and 25 years down the road, the U.S. president, the Israeli prime minister, the leaders of the P5+1 will decide how they want to approach Iran at that point. Doesnt mean they get a free pass.  What it does mean is we get a couple of decades of peace until 2030, which is a lot better than not having it next week. [bell sounds]', 'Yeah, sure.', 'Look, Iran having access to its frozen funds is not something we would welcome.  Weve been very clear, the administration has been very clear that Iran is a destabilizing factor in the region.  Its a state supporter of terrorism, and we dont want to see the Iranian regime have more money at its disposable to pursue some of these activities.  But as Tom reminded the group earlier on, this is a nuclear agreement.  The reason these specific sanctions are in place -- the only reason we got the rest of the world to join these sanctions -- and, by the way, it was only when the rest of the world joined them that they became effective -- is that they were focused on Irans nuclear weapons program.  Now, it seems to me what our opponents are suggesting here, or those who dont want to move ahead with this deal, is that we focused it on the nuclear program to get international support for the sanctions, we brought down the Iranian economy, and then in the 11th hour we say, Oh, by the way, even though weve gotten what we want on the nuclear side, lets keep on the sanctions because we actually now want Iran to stop supporting terrorism, recognize Israel, stop messing around in Yemen -- and, let me just be clear, Im for all of those things. We should be vigorously trying to pursue all of those goals, but the idea that we can just shift gears and say, Were not even doing the deal until then, is a recipe not for getting both a nuclear deal and constraining Iran in the region, its a recipe for getting neither.', 'Might I have a word on that?', 'Just to remind people, the proposition on the table is whether this deal is good for America.  Now, a lot of our allies in the region and elsewhere have real concerns about Iran, and so do we.  And we stand with them on that.  But a lot of our allies in the region would not mind if we went to war against Iran.  And we used force in Syria against Irans proxy there.  And we stood up and fought militia in Iraq.  And that may well be in their interest.  The proposition on the table is, is this good for America?', 'Its actually [unintelligible] explanation because theres not a great discrepancy.  Id actually urge you to read -- the Belfer Center at Harvard did a really nice comparison of the U.S. fact sheet and what Iranians have been saying, because a lot of people have picked up on this.  You know, its a different agreement, and they dont really agree to it.  Not surprisingly, each side is emphasizing what it gets and minimizing what its giving.  And the Iranians are really doing that. But when you actually look at what the Iranians have said, they dont take issue with our fact sheet.  Theyve called it spin, and theyve emphasized what they dont have to do. But its, I dare say on their side, all spin.  Right? So, you know, theyll emphasize all of the things that theyll preserve without -- theyll have a 300-kilogram stockpile.  This sort of overlooked the fact that theyre going to give up 98 percent of what they currently have.  And theyll have 5,000 operating centrifuges.  They dont emphasize the fact that to get there they have to dismantle more than 5,000 others.  So if you actually look at the details of the two sides, you dont find a huge gap.  You find a huge gap in emphasis, but they dont -- they dont deny the agreement that we articulated [unintelligible].', '[unintelligible] breakout and Tom will do infrastructure.  Specifically breakout timeline is the amount of time that would be required to accumulate enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon.  And we err on the side of caution when we calculate it.  Theyve actually been at two months for quite a long time.  When you keep asking, we dont have to deal with that.  Theyre there now, today, as we sit here.  But you should address the virtually preserved infrastructure [unintelligible].', 'Well, one reason is thats partly what got us here.  You know, the world, as Iran started to do enrichment and move toward the potential weapons capability, go back to 2003, decided that the outcome had to be zero enrichment.  And we insisted on that, and we insisted on that as they increased from, at the time, 160 centrifuges.  And we said, No, it has to be zero.  Then they got up to 3,000, we said It has to be zero.  And they had 6,000, It has to be zero.  And weve done that all the way to 19,000. So we could, as you suggest, and as I think Mike and Mark would suggest, keep choking. While we choke -- you know, we could take that gamble.  As I said before, we could have showed up at the talks in the first day, said The only outcome here is zero enrichment, no civilian reactors and fill Fordow with cement and let us go anywhere, anytime, including your military bases.  We could have said that.  Im just suggesting that had we done so, choking, choking sanctions, instead of 19,000 centrifuges, wed get to 25, and then 30, and then theyd finish the heavy water reactor at Arak, and then theyd harden Fordow -- and then we would have another debate three years from now, and theyd be at 30,000 centrifuges and all the rest --', 'Be careful --', 'Yeah, lets just turn this all over to the Canadians. Look, an important point on number of centrifuges, because it allows me to correct the negotiating records, and Marks suggesting that we caved on number of centrifuges, and Mike said the same thing, to correct the negotiating record.  Weve been very consistent from the very start on what outcome we needed on enrichment. What we needed was a breakout timeline of a year.  The breakout timeline is not just a function of the number of centrifuges.  Its a combination of the number of centrifuges, the type of centrifuges, and the stockpile that you have.  We told Iran, There are a lot of different ways to make us comfortable that youre at least a year away from fissile material for a bomb.  If you want a higher number of centrifuges, then you have to have a lower stockpile or you have to rely on these old out-of-date IR-1s, because what we care about is that you cant quickly breakout.  So you -- we could have gotten a lower number of centrifuges but maybe of a different type or a bigger stockpile.  What we got was extending their breakout timeline from what were living with today, which, as Tom said, is not where we would like to be, to an agreement that for at least a decade theyre going to be more than a year -- at least a year away.  And thats where the number of centrifuges [inaudible].', 'He said they dont need enrichment at Fordow, and the agreement is very clear, there will be no enrichment at Fordow.  There will be no fissile material at Fordow-- [talking simultaneously]', '-- of uranium, which is how you make a nuclear weapon.', 'And still [inaudible] -- [talking simultaneously] [bell sounds]', 'So, this has been a good debate.  And weve had a bit of fun with it.  But the truth is, its a very serious topic.  And I have a lot of respect for a lot of the arguments that weve heard.  As you sit here and think about how you want to vote, whether you believe this deal is good for America or not, I would ask you to imagine not that youre just sitting here and you get a free vote as a citizen, but youre the president of the United States. And its June 30th.  And your team has come back and said, Mr. President, Madame President, its been really hard, but we got the framework that weve talked out.  Well, weve got it.  Now you just have to decide if its good for America or not. Now, maybe Mister, Madame President -- Mike and Mark have persuaded you its not good for America and you should reject it.  And if you do, maybe well put on more sanctions, and somehow the world will follow us, even though we walked away from the agreement. And maybe Iran will then come back to the table and agree to zero or 500 centrifuges. And maybe theyll get rid of their heavy water reactor anyway.  And maybe theyll accept anytime, anywhere inspections, including military bases.  And maybe theyll recognize Israel and stop terrorism.  Maybe all that will happen, speaking of fantasies -- because you thought this deal wasnt good and you rejected it, and you hoped all those things would happen, Mister, Madame President.  On the other hand, maybe well walk away.  We wont be able to keep the international sanctions coalition together.  Iran will start resuming all of those things it stopped doing with the joint plan of action, stockpiling 20 percent uranium, spinning 10,000, 19,000 centrifuges and more, finishing the heavy water reactor at Arak.  And at that point, you -- and think about this very seriously -- will be faced with a choice.  Either you acquiesce and let them finish that heavy water reactor and build more centrifuges, or use military force to stop it, which would have all sorts of other consequences in the region. Thats what Id ask you to think about when you decide if this agreement is good for America or not.  I would suspect that --', '-- if we got to that point --', '-- the deal you walked away from would look very good indeed.']\n",
      "['Short answer is, one more than Track I.  The long answer: its non-officials engaged in diplomacy to see if they can find a way to crack the nut.', 'Thank you, John, and thank you for your warm welcome.  Its a pleasure to be here with Phil and also with Mike and Mark.  I have much I think to say tonight in a very short period of time, and I will do what I can to compress it.  Not too long ago when he was still alive, Daniel Patrick Moynihan said famously that, Youre each entitled to your own opinion but not your own set of facts.  Tonight from Mr. Doran weve heard an extremely interesting, unusual, and strange set of facts. So let me just cover a few of those that I think will be helpful to your understanding of the arrangements that we have to deal with. First and foremost is the notion in his part that somehow $50 billion will pass on the moment of signature.  The truth is, of course, that until Iran complies with four major requirements of the deal -- that they put their centrifuges aside; that they change their stockpile from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms; that they, in fact, dismantle the central piece of the reactor that can make plutonium; and that they agree on that the past efforts that they made in a nuclear direction, in a nuclear weapons direction, are fully explained to and satisfactorily explained to the International Atomic Energy Agency -- they get nothing out of this deal. No sanctions relief until those particular steps take place, no money passes hands to Iran.  Secondly, the notion that Iran is somehow going to enjoy, when it does get this money, the opportunity to play havoc in the Middle East is both strange and unusual.  Certainly we watch carefully what Iran does.  And none of us have undertaken the notion that the Iranians are angels, that the whole agreement is indeed put together with very strong inspection mechanisms well beyond what you have ever seen before in any country around the world in order to prevent the kind of cheating or indeed the kind of misuse of the agreement for narrow political advantage. Were the Iranians, in fact, going to misuse this money, they would have far done it well before any receipts from sanctions relief, their priorities for the things that theyre doing in the region are high enough, I think, for them to continue to do that.  It is important, too, to remember this is a nuclear agreement, not a ballistic missile agreement.  Both sides have agreed on the importance of the nuclear agreement as a matter of priority. Obviously, a missile -- ballistic missile without a nuclear warhead is not the kind of threat that has been portrayed to you here.  And there are plenty of opportunities in the next set of agreements, if this one is successfully concluded, to move on to that particular effort. Now, let me turn, if I can, to the key questions, and theyre important to all of us here. Youve already understood that both sides share a deep sense of the necessity to stop any Iranian nuclear weapon.  Thats stipulated and agreed. Its important, however, to understand that the second question -- is this a good deal for America -- is one that we would certainly answer in the positive for a whole set of reasons that Phil set out for you.  And the third question is, what are the alternatives to this deal?  Well, the alternatives, quite starkly and quite frankly, are two: no deal at all, or an attempt to use sanctions to see if, in fact, we can achieve a better deal.  You heard from Mr. Doran that he would like to have zero enrichment.  I would like to have zero enrichment, too.  Id like to be a billionaire. [laughter]  Id like to believe in the Tooth Fairy.  But for 14 years, previous administrations attempted to negotiate for zero enrichment, and got nowhere. And the value of zero enrichment, in my view, is not significant compared to the value of the arrangement that we now have on the table, with all of its inspection mechanisms, and with all of its limitations on Iran, and thats extremely important to keep in mind. In addition to that, what would happen if we walked away from an agreement?  How and in what way would that affect the situation?  It would affect it very badly.  We would have turned down what our allies joined us in negotiating.  The notion that we could achieve effective additional sanctions without friends, allies, and indeed, without the participation of the world community, is well beyond reality.  Its not there and its not [unintelligible].  The third question is, what would happen in the event we had no agreement.  Iran, of course, could move freely to a nuclear weapon.  They would have two to three months to breakout time.  They would, if they -- theyre so inclined, use that opportunity, as we have a 10-year agreement with a 15-year limitation on the production of more than 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to hold them in place, and I think thats important. Finally, I think its significant that you understand that the alternatives to an agreement may well involve the necessity to use force under conditions where we would be highly isolated, having turned down the kind of agreement we participated centrally in negotiating -- a good agreement.  If we were to use force, it would mean, I think, from the best judgment that I can get of military officials, a three to five-year cessation in the Iranian agreement before they could move back to where they are now.  And a situation under which we would have to bomb pretty continuously to keep the Iranians under that kind of stricture and under that kind of pressure.  To me, there is no alternative. This agreement is a good one.  I hope that you will consider that carefully. And when the time comes to push your little button, push the button in the right order for the right set of arrangements that President Obama has put before you.  Thank you very much. [applause]', 'Look, let me offer you the facts, not your imagination, not your predictions --', '-- these are the facts --', '-- yes, of course they have.  Theyve started. Male Speaker: [inaudible] Thomas Pickering: Theyve started.', 'But thats a step.  But we will not --', '-- conclude the release of sanctions until they have come clean with the IAEA.  Thats an indisputable negotiating objective of the United States.  Thats what we have said we will agree to, nothing less.  And so thats -- youre sitting here making up fairy stories about what it is thats going to be agreed or not agreed.  Nobody that I know of, when the framework came out on April 2nd, who knows anything about this agreement was not surprised by the degree to which Iran had come in our directions, including, I have to tell you, a number of very senior Iranians.  The notion that somehow we have been snookered or somehow that this process will not work, totally defeats the fact that throughout the Cold War we made a whole series of agreements with the Soviet Union. President Reagan said in his best Russian, Doveryai, no proveryai, Trust but verify. Thats the basis of this agreement.', 'This is nothing new here.', 'Just not accurate, Mark.', 'Theyve already come on 8 according to the IAEA, but lets not argue about the details.', 'Lets argue about the notion that they cannot get sanctions relief until they do. Male Speaker: [inaudible]', 'Thats in return for the joint program of action.', 'But thats --', 'The way that --', '-- European allies -- the Russians, the Chinese, the Brits, the French, and the Germans have been with us.  Even with an --', '-- occasional protest from [French spoken] Francais.', 'So, but its very true.', 'Every step of the way.', 'So, one percent --', '-- of their economy --', '-- one percent changed their economy.', 'Look, your predictions are your predictions. They have nothing to do with the framework.  They have nothing to do with what we now have in hand, and they have nothing to do with what is now being currently negotiated as the final language of the agreement, which I am told is moving well.  So if you want to believe the Tooth Fairy, if you want to believe the worst of all possible predictions, theres your choice.  But its not up on the board.  Youre not voting for anything but the Obama proposal at the present time or some alternative imaginary set of ideas.  We constantly have asked, how is it that you would get done what it is you want to get done?  And why is what you want to get done so much more worthwhile in the process of moving ahead?  Everybody knows they negotiated for a house here in this room.  How many in this room have negotiated for a house?  Everybody knows your first bid is not the acceptable answer to what it is you get. Its plain and simple. [laughter]', 'The question, please, before they start my 30 seconds.  What question --', 'Pieces of this deal last forever, including the fact that Iran is obligated not to do anything to move toward nuclear weapons.  Secondly, the additional inspection protocol stays on forever.  So those are very important because they will signal to us plenty early as to whether the Iranians are keeping their commitments or staying out of the nuclear weapons business as we go ahead.  And its important that we have those to guarantee the process is moving ahead.  And we have the force at the end of the day if they violate this agreement. [laughter]', 'You want to take it?', '[unintelligible].', 'Thank you.', 'I think its clear that they will be deeply invested in being part of the international community from which they have been excluded.  So there is no question that at least one possibility is that they will behave and not move toward a nuclear weapon.  The other possibility is we will certainly, as I pointed out a minute ago, know if they do.  And we will have exactly the same retributive capabilities then as we have now.  And in my view that is the arrangement that makes the most sense and the best deal that we have been able to get up until now, and our friends have shown us absolutely no way to improve the deal. I would love to find ways to improve the deal, but I am totally satisfied that the deal we have now on the table is a deal which we can certainly live with and that we will have every opportunity to assure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.', 'Let me just --', '-- say the following, that before the November 24th preliminary agreement was even reached, Prime Minister Netanyahu said it was the worst of all possible agreements ever negotiated.  Within a year, he was back to us, pleading with us to accept this agreement as the forever document in the process of moving ahead.  He said the same thing about the comprehensive framework before it appeared.  Now that it is appeared, I hear nothing from Prime Minister Netanyahu further about the arrangement.  There is no other alternative in my view that is achievable, that has the capacity to stop the Iranians from making a nuclear weapon. And my view is at this stage, that the allies may be jealous of the fact -- which is purely imaginary -- that somehow, Iran is going to emerge as some kind of new hegemon in the Middle East.  The president, Im sure, made it clear to them at the Camp David summit, that was the farthest thing from his mind.  But it is important, in fact, that we deal with realities and not with the kind of imagination that sits across the table from us.', 'John, weve strayed a long way from that -- [laughter] -- but I cannot help to ask --', '-- who here has heard of ISIS?  Here is Michael suggesting that in fact the Iranian opposition to ISIS is somehow in Iraq a dangerous development for American interests. That, I find, very hard to jump to that conclusion.  I just wanted to make sure that you understood that thinking.', '[unintelligible].', 'Ninety percent of their low enriched uranium, thats their entire infrastructure?', '[unintelligible] centrifuges.', '[unintelligible] of their reactors.  Is that their entire infrastructure? [bell sounds]', 'Just -- just one point.  With too much breakout and no agreement, we have a problem. Secondly, this infrastructure --', 'And who --', 'And that was because we needed zero enrichment to solve the problem.', 'Not at all.  That was the key question.', 'I was asked to respond to your point --', '-- on infrastructure.', 'And I just said carefully and quietly -- [laughter] -- giving up 90 percent of your low enriched -- 98 percent of your low enriched uranium --', '-- is certainly preserving your infrastructure.  Getting rid of 14,000 of 20,000 centrifuges is getting rid of your infrastructure -- its not getting rid of your infrastructure.  Its preserving it.  Keeping the Arak reactor in a position where it can make kilograms of weapons grade plutonium per year, but taking it out of that particular capacity, thats certainly keeping the infrastructure in place.  And we could go on.  But those three examples, in my view, are serious degradations of Iraqs nuclear infrastructure.', 'Not at all.  The Iranians -- [talking simultaneously]', 'Thats why were such successful negotiators. [laughter] Female Speaker: My name is Stella [spelled phonetically].  The question is, why isnt the solution more and more choking sanctions?  And why does this deal have to happen right now?  Why cant we just choke them further with sanctions until were in a better bargaining position to do a better deal? [applause]', 'I want to take you to two stories that I think are important and throw light on this question.  Two years ago a few of us met with then the leading Iranian negotiator.  He said to us frankly that For eight years we have been in the doghouse.  Ahmadinejad put us there, and were now coming out.  We will come forward with a set of ideas and principles for the negotiation that will deal effectively with the problem of your suspicion about our nuclear weapon. And we will accept inspections, a wide variety of them.  And we want sanctions relief. And if we cannot achieve this with you in a reasonable period of time, we wont be back.  And thats, in fact, what has happened, interestingly enough.  And thats where we are now. A second story:  Two weeks ago I had the opportunity on successive days to hear again from the lead negotiators on both sides.  And as Philip mentioned just a moment ago, each one of them said to us, This is a good deal for the following reasons, and the Iranian reasons were, guess what, quite friendly to the Iranian point of view and ignored the question of the major negotiating concessions they had to make.  The Americans were less so but, nevertheless, reflected their view. But when I sat down just as the Belfer Center sat down, I could not find any reason to believe that what they had said was so inconsistent that, in fact, we didnt have a deal very close to in hand, and that nothing contravened the framework. We now have a new opportunity in the region, but we have a new opportunity first with Iran now, to stop any effort toward a nuclear weapon.  So, I urge you to vote Yes when the time comes, to support this arrangement.  It is, in my view, the answer to this difficult problem.']\n",

      "[\"Well, I'd like to think I've gotten better at my job and have done a better job of getting the public to focus on the right questions.\", 'My debate partner is the wonderful and absolutely brilliant Barry Scheck.', \"The death penalty should be abolished because it fails to enhance public safety.  We all want a criminal justice system that is effective and secure, one that creates more safety and less violence, but that is not what the death penalty is doing.  In states where the death penalty is used, as you've already heard, we have a higher homicide rate.  In the South, for example, which has the highest number of executions -- there's the highest homicide rate.  In the Northeast, by contrast, which has the lowest execution rate, we have a lower murder rate.  These differences tell us that we have to take a closer look at what works and what doesn't, and take a commonsense approach to public safety. If we take a commonsense approach to public safety, you must vote in favor of the motion to abolish the death penalty.  Everyone wants a neighborhood that's safe and communities that are strong.  And in order to do that, we have to focus on the root causes of crime.  We know why crime and violence happens, when other things are neglected.  Mental health services, safe and affordable housing, schools that prepare us for our future jobs, and jobs that pay living wages.  When the nation's police chiefs were surveyed about what they thought our priorities should be when it comes to enhancing public safety, the death penalty ranked last consistently.  Some even went so far as to say that the death penalty was an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.  What do police chiefs think should be our focus and attention?  It should be on more resources for law enforcement, particularly training, drug treatment, and again, a stronger economy with better jobs. Most of these police chiefs also thought the death penalty wasn't a deterrent.  Why? Based on their experience.  Because perpetrators rarely consider the consequences when they engage in violence.  More evidence that the death penalty is disconnected from at true public safety objective is the fact that it's used so rarely.  In 2014, we only had 72 new death sentences in the entire country.  And execution rates continue to drop as well.  In 2013, we had 39 executions.  In 2014, we had 35.  The death penalty was used -- executions took place in mostly three states.  80 percent of the executions in 2014 took place in Texas, Missouri, and Florida. And even in those states that used the death penalty frequently, the death penalty is really relegated to pockets within those states.  Abstract justifications for the death penalty have little meaning in a context where it's used so rarely and unpredictably.  The death penalty does, however, reinforce our nation's sad and ugly history of slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and racial inequality.  A substantial body of research spanning 40 years  it remarkably, consistently shows that race, particularly race of the victim, is the single-most reliable predictor of whether you're going to get a death sentence.  The death penalty is rarely used when the victim is a person of color, particularly African American men, even though African American men are most likely to be the victims of homicide.  And that figure correlates with the recent report from the Vera Institute, that found that as a society, we provide very little services for African American men, that we don't take the victimization of African American men seriously. And so, that statistic is borne out by what we're actually doing as a society.  We're also seeing, in recent studies, that the most likely person to receive a death sentence is an African American person who is convicted of killing a white victim.  We have a system that treats some lives as worth more than others.  And we have current information about how, as a society, we are two sets of people living in the same space with very different experiences, with our interactions with law enforcement.  Under those circumstances, we cannot have a system that decides who lives and who dies.  The death penalty is an outdated practice that is hindering our nation's forward progress. Therefore, I urge you to vote for the motion, to Abolish the Death Penalty. [applause]\", 'I\\'ll go first.  I mean, I think that the real question is whether it can be fixed.  I mean, we\\'ve been at this for over 40 years.  The court has looked at this, and what we\\'ve seen is as the justices have looked at this case, one-by-one they\\'re coming to say, you know, \"This isn\\'t going to work.\"  So, I don\\'t believe it can be fixed.  It is something that seems to be beyond us, to get the racism out, to get the mistake out.  We\\'ve been trying this. And so the question really is, \"Do we continue to do this?\"', \"Well, I think the moral ground is this is not necessary for the government to do, and I think the burden is really on the proponents of this policy to say that it does something that is of value.  And we haven't heard that.\", \"Yeah, I want to bring this back to what this is really a conversation about, which is a public policy question.  It is not an abstract conversation about whether some people deserve to die.  And I think that's the point.  We've been proceeding down this road as if that's the question.  The question is do we do things that don't add up to a real product and we've yet to hear.  We hear oh, both sides of the story about --\", \"Because we're talking about a public policy like everything else.  And when you have a public policy decision to make you look at does this thing that we're doing actually produce what it's supposed to?  Does it work in a way that it's supposed to work?  And our opponents concede that this thing is broken. They just say we need to keep trying to fix it.  The point is it's broken.\", \"I would just say, you know, we're talking as if we're -- the only thing out there is the death penalty. The vast majority of homicides do not result in a death sentence.  The vast majority of cases that are resolved have justice because people are serving long prison sentences, including life without parole.  So, the idea that unless we have the death penalty, we cannot have justice, is just a false premise.\", 'But our point is we need more evidence than that, and the burden is on you to show that this is useful.  There is no affirmative strong argument or evidence to suggest that the death penalty is a deterrent, and you\\'ve admitted that.  You said, \"It\\'s equivocal, but we should keep going forward,\" and that\\'s really the public policy question.', \"I wish I had the power to move goal posts the way Kent was talking about, but we don't do that.  The facts are the same.  What I see is sort of Kent looking selectively at the evidence.  The case has always been that the death penalty actually tracks our history of racial apartheid when it comes to criminal justice, that the death penalty when we had slave codes actually was meted out based on the race of the victim and the race of the defendant, and even though the slave codes and -- we've made some progress, the -- the process -- the system still works the same way.  The core issue is that the death penalty values some lives more than others. And when it comes to the good that our opponents are saying the death penalty offers, that good is only used when the victim is white, because that's where the system currently sees the value lying.\", 'And the data is there.  And the reason --', '-- because [unintelligible] --', 'Sure.  Well, first of all -- [talking simultaneously] Diann Rust-Tierney: -- finish.', \"to 2013, and what that study found was two things, first, that the race of victim discrimination continued, that the least likely -- as I said earlier, the least likely victim for whom the death penalty is sought will be an African-American man even though African-American men are the most likely to be the victims of homicide.  And they also found that the defendant -- a defendant who was convicted and sent to death for murdering a white victim who was African-American is far more likely. One other point, prosecutors -- every study -- there's been over 200 studies over 40 years -- every study has found that prosecutors seek the death penalty for crimes against white victims more frequently than other victims.\", \"I've not said that. [laughter]\", 'Absolutely not.', '[unintelligible] 40 years of -- 40 -- we have studied the death penalty in every state that had it 40 years, different researchers, different approaches, and the data -- the outcome is remarkably consistent, remarkably consistent finding racial bias.', \"You know, we have to keep bringing this back to reality.  We're in the midst of a conversation in this country right today where African-Americans and people of color do not have the same experience with law enforcement that other people have.  And we're telling people that we have essentially two systems of justice, and in that context we cannot have a death penalty.  And what we're talking about in terms of years of study is the same science that we use to look at implicit bias generally.  It's the same science that we use to determine that there's a glass ceiling for women.  It's the same science that we've used to determine that women are not receiving equal pay.  I mean, this is not some made-up science.  This is how we determine whether a system, even a neutral system, operates in a way that has a discriminatory impact.\", 'I think -- Male Speaker: Yeah.', 'Well, I would say --', \"-- you know, most of our allies who are committed to the advancement of human rights and civil rights really are looking to the United States to abolish the death penalty because we do have a reputation for leading in these areas.  And so, I think that in addition to the good that it would do for us to get rid of the death penalty, we could actually make a larger contribution to the broader struggle that many in other countries that you mentioned are fighting.  You know, there -- we have a trial.  There are people who are sentenced to death without the kind of trial and protections that we have. There are people who are sentenced to death who don't know when they're going to be executed.  The guard comes from the -- and those kinds of situations can't really be addressed as long as the United States can be pointed to as still having it. So, there's a very important benefit for us to abolish the death penalty, because we can advance human rights in other places where we could all agree that human rights need to be advanced.\", 'I think one of the sad things about the death penalty is because the punishment is so severe that the limited resources -- as much as Barry is able to do with the Innocence Projects across the country, have to focus on, you know, those people who are sentenced to death.  I think if there were no death penalty, there would be many more resources and much more opportunity to look for and address the question of innocence of people who are serving other sentences. You know, keep in mind, there\\'s one underlying theme, we make mistakes, and we\\'re being told that, you know, \"Well, some mistakes are tolerable,\" but I think your point is the fact that we have to focus on the death penalty means we cannot focus the resources that we need to address the problem of a system that makes mistakes.', 'But that -- that --', \"-- I want to bring it back to what the question was.  The question is not -- because many of the people that were surveyed did support the death penalty in theory, but when they were asked from their position of having to manage law enforcement resources and from their experience about what they thought it needed to take -- what it took to make the community safer, they made a choice that said that the death penalty, among all the things that we could have, is the least useful thing that we would need.  So, the distinction is not whether these people support the death penalty in theory.  The question is whether when you have to make tough choices about resources, whether this is the thing that's going to get the result.\", \"My first observation is that -- [applause] Diann Rust-Tierney: My first observation is that the death penalty has to stand and fall on its own accord. The conversation that Robert is having about punishment whether it's enough and whether -- it's a whole different conversation.  We are here to talk about whether this policy actually advances public safety and it doesn't.  The other point I want to make is that, you know, it's not the media is [unintelligible]. The public when it thinks about the death penalty has to learn more about it.  Most people don't think about the death penalty and so the support is uninformed.  What we're seeing is as things like botched executions explode in the media, as we're hearing about states going and getting drugs to kill people from the back of a driving school and all these crazy things, the public is starting to focus on it and when they focus on it they see that they don't like it.  So, that's why we're seeing state after state that examines this practice decide hmm, we don't need this.  That's why we're seeing the public support for the death penalty continue to decline.  It's no magic that the media is doing. It's no magic that I'm doing.  When you look at this system and you really understand how it works, you cannot support it.  You cannot square it with our other values.\", 'You must vote in favor of the motion to abolish the death penalty because it is inconsistent with the fundamental reality and core value of our society.  All human beings are capable of change. That capacity to change is a fundamental value underlying our criminal justice system which is designed not just to punish but to rehabilitate.  We believe that there should always be the opportunity for redemption, rehabilitation, and even grace.  And the death penalty cuts that opportunity off.  The choice is simple.  Do we continue down a path that has continued consistently to produce results?  Do we continue with an institution that harms and traumatizes people?  I\\'ve met and talked to the people that the death penalty harms and traumatizes, prison workers, defense counsel, prosecutors, judges, the condemned, and families of the condemned, jurors, and survivors of homicide.  Regardless of whether a victim supports or opposes the death penalty, if you listen carefully to their voices, one message comes through, \"It hurts. The death penalty process by its very nature hurts.\"  It is the nature of the beast, therefore, it must be abolished.  I urge you to vote in favor of the motion to abolish the death penalty.']\n",
      "['There are 362 post-conviction DNA exonerations.  19 people off death row.  Many, many people that were convicted of murder in non-capital eligible states.', 'Yes.', 'Reasonable people can disagree about whether capital punishment is a morally appropriate sanction for the most heinous of crimes. And our opponents place tremendous value on retribution by execution.  They think that is an incredible benefit.  But I think when you reason about this as a public policy issue, and that\\'s why we\\'re here, and you look at the costs and benefits of having a death penalty versus life without parole at a maximum security prison, you\\'re going to reach the same conclusion that six states have reached in the last six years: the death penalty doesn\\'t work.  It should be repealed and abolished.  What are the costs?  The death penalty creates an undeniable and unacceptable risk of executing innocents.  The death penalty does not deter.  The National Academy of Sciences recently reviewed all of the studies and found no evidence of a deterrent effect.  And common sense tells you that, because the states that execute the most, like Texas and Virginia, do not have lower homicide rates, do not have lower crime rates, than the states that don\\'t have the death penalty. The death penalty is administered arbitrarily.  It depends on the quality of your representation.  And who has money and your race often turns on -- often determines what kind of representation you get.  The death penalty also depends on where you\\'re tried.  It\\'s incredibly arbitrary in this sense.  It\\'s only 2 percent of counties in the United States that are responsible for 60 -- 56 percent of the executions -- of the death sentences and 52 percent of executions.  There are race effects that Diann is going to talk to you about at some length, particularly having to do with the race of the victim. And the death penalty, as Diann will also address at greater length, does nothing to increase or insure public safety.  So, this undermines the fair administration of justice. Take California. We know that in California there are over 700 people on death row.  And they haven\\'t had an execution for years.  And they have hundreds of people who have been convicted and sentenced to death that don\\'t have lawyers in a post-conviction setting, and they\\'re closing down civil courts.  And the dockets are clogged, and this led to a judge recently in California saying, \"It is the gridlock, it is the -- in California that makes the death penalty unconstitutional, because it is freakish and it is arbitrarily applied.\"  You are more likely to die of natural causes after 24 years in prison in California than you are to be executed.  Now, there should not be any disagreement about one moral and one factual question, and that is the unacceptable risk of executing innocent people.  Bob talked about the Boston Marathon bomber trial, but let\\'s not forget that in April -- early April Anthony Hinton walked off death row in Alabama. Bryan Stevenson -- he had been on death row for 30 years. He was convicted based on bogus ballistics evidence.  And the prosecution held back exculpatory evidence in that case for nine years.  And he had an ineffective lawyer as the Supreme Court itself ruled.  Just this week a young man in New Orleans, Mr. Stewart -- Kia Stewart, was exonerated with the help of the prosecutors and the Innocence Project in New Orleans.  He was tried for murder in New Orleans, represented by law students at Tulane Law School and a supervisor that had no experience in murder cases.  This kind of stuff goes on all  across the country, and we\\'ve got to face up to it.  What is the error rate of convicting people that are innocent?  Sam Gross at the University of Michigan Law School submitted a paper in the National Academy of Science Proceedings and showed that when you look at capital convictions, you can demonstrate on innocence grounds a 4.1 percent error rate, 4.1 percent error rate. I mean, would you accept that in flying airplanes?  I mean, really.  Now, there\\'s no doubt innocents have also been executed.  I hope you\\'re all familiar with the work of our colleague, Jim Liebman, from Columbia Law School, documenting the wrongful execution of Carlos DeLuna.  And I certainly hope you\\'re aware of the case of Cameron Todd Willingham, who was executed in Texas based on what now is acknowledged by the state itself to be bogus arson evidence for an arson murder, killing his three children.  And we now have evidence that there was a jailhouse snitch that committed perjury by his own admission, and you can demonstrate it in the case.  And now the Texas Bar has brought the prosecutor in that case up on charges, because he knew about a deal with the jailhouse snitch that he never revealed.  Now, that is unbelievable. You cannot anymore kid yourself on the fact that innocents have been executed due to junk forensic science, prosecutorial misconduct, law enforcement misconduct, ineffective lawyers. This system is incapable not just of determining who\\'s guilty or innocence in the final analysis when charging them with the ultimate punishment but reliably figuring out who should die and who shouldn\\'t.  We shouldn\\'t be tinkering with the machinery of death, and we see prosecutors telling us this every day.  Mark Earley, the attorney general of Virginia, who presided and brought about 36 executions, has just come to the position as he left office that \"The death penalty is based on a false utopian premise.  That false premise is that we have had and do have and will have 100 percent accuracy in death penalty convictions and executions.  Who should live and who should die?  I can no longer support the imposition of a penalty so final in nature yet so fraught with failures.\" Go look at the statement of Marty Stroud, a prosecutor in a Caddo Parish, Shreveport, Louisiana -- Glenn Ford, 30 years on death row, innocent. Marty prosecuted him.  He recently gave this statement, he said it\\'ll be his only one, where he said, \"How did this happen?  I knew that the defense lawyers were -- had never tried a capital case, and I wanted to win.  We all wanted to win.  I was 32 years old, and I wanted to win, and I didn\\'t see it.\"  So, I leave this to you: our friend, George Will.  All right, George Will has said that \"Conservatives -- capital punishment is a government program, so skepticism is in order.\" [applause]', 'Well, the -- and --', '-- you\\'re missing a point here when you ask a loaded question like that, \"if it could be perfected\"', 'Oh, but my opponents argument is, \"It should be effective, swift, and sure,\" right?', \"It -- I -- it's an impossible hypothetical.  I'm a law professor.  I hate to fight the hypothetical, but what --\", \"You know, if you're making a public policy argument and you're living just as the attorney general in Virginia said, in a fairly land, where you actually believe that you're going to eliminate the risk of executing innocent people, which you didn't mention, John, is a major cost of the death penalty, which we now know is much greater than we ever did before.  Not just because of DNA testing.  DNA testing obviously has proven that, but in 2009 the National Academy of Sciences has just indicated in a groundbreaking report that fingerprints, ballistics, bite mark evidence, pattern evidence, all kinds of other evidence that we used to rely on think we're so sure are in doubt and we're now trying to get all these resources together to do basic applied research and make it reliable.\", \"That's -- I'll admit I don't trust the government to get it right.  I'm like George Will--\", \"It's a government program.\", \"I should add one thing on the -- I don't want to be perceived as ducking the moral question.  I think that there are plenty of people in this country that are pro-life, that believe that it is wrong to take a life. You know, the Pope -- in the corner with the Pope and others on that question, but when you're debating a public policy issue about something like this that doesn't work and is causing incredible suffering for the wrongly convicted, even for many families of murder victims that don't find closure in this process and go through it, some do, I just, you know, nobody wants to say that the moral question is irrelevant, but it is a factor to be weighed.  That's all.  And there are plenty of people on the right that think it's morally wrong to take a life.\", 'Well, I -- first of all, I think Bob ducked your question about how many --', \"-- how many innocents -- what is the error rate for executing the wrongly-convicted that would be tolerable in the cost-benefit analysis? And I know that you'd want to see the system perfected, but when you have really good analysis by Sam Gross in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, pointing that we have a 4.1 error rate -- percent error rate in capital cases in the United States, I'd submit to you that's really an unacceptable number.\", \"Well, it's not even a question.\", \"You don't even have to characterize it.\", \"Let's just say --\", '-- John asked you, if it\\'s one in a million.  What if it\\'s 1 in 400?  What if it\\'s one in 1,000? I mean, let\\'s get to numbers that, frankly, are pretty close to that error rate.  I mean, you know, we\\'re not even getting into -- there\\'s over 1,500 people whose convictions in this country, since 1989, were vacated based on new evidence of innocence. And you may say, \"Oh, that\\'s two\" -- the Registry of Wrongful Convictions says that, and maybe Kent will say, \"Well, not all of them were innocent.  Maybe some of them just got unfair trials\" or something like that.  But these numbers are substantial.  The 326 --', '-- post-conviction DNA exonerations, they were all innocent.', \"But -- but one thing that we can all agree on -- because Bob believes it, and tell me if you don't -- Male Speaker: I'm sorry? Barry Scheck: -- that you believe it -- and tell me if you don't -- and I thought you conceded it, Ken -- and that is the National Academy of Sciences, when it looked at all the studies on deterrence, said there is no persuasive evidence that it deters.  And my point to you is that if you're going to use the ultimate punishment and you want to justify it on the basis of deterrence when there's no persuasive evidence that it deters, we win that point in the public policy debate. Male Speaker: No response to that. [applause]\", '-- it\\'s the Baldus study in the McCleskey case, that went off on the issue of race of the victim, that is the effect that has been replicated countless times no matter who looks at the data and how often, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find the weight of criminologists and scientists saying, \"The race of the victim makes a difference, period.\"', \"So, I've heard you say this before and it's true, all right, and the -- you say well if we eliminate the felony aggravator then we'll get rid of some of these race effects, which Bob, you acknowledge exist in the system, and we've got to be in the real world.  That's not happening.\", \"Bob, I mean, people should know your real position and I understand it intellectually. Yes, you are saying that, you know, logical extension of your argument is if we had that kind of punitive segregation and -- that that would make life without parole a more acceptable alternative to you than the death penalty.  Just in case people missed it, you were objecting to the way that lethal injection is done because you don't want people anesthetized so that it looks like you want people to see that there is suffering at the time of the execution.  You think that's important.  You favor firing squads, right?\", \"Right.  So, let's just look -- I mean, your argument is a retributive argument.  You're not arguing deterrence.  You're not arguing that there is a high risk of executing innocents. You have a position which I understand, but I actually don't think that that is a generally shared view.\", \"Oh, giving little ground there on deterrence, I see. But look, the question brings up the statistic I cited at the very beginning.  If you have counties -- counties is really what you have to look at, although most of them are in the South.  But there are a few that over-produce death in California.  If two percent of the counties in this country are producing 56 percent of the death sentences and 52 percent of the executions, when two-thirds of Americans reside in counties, where there hasn't been -- there's been one execution or less in 45 years, right?  All of a sudden you begin to see -- and it doesn't take much to see it -- that there are just a small number of counties in this country and a small number of states that are engaged in capital punishment in a serious way.\", \"And let's be clear about what those costs are.  When Maryland studied the death penalty before they abolished it, they were able to determine that a capital case was seven times more expensive than a noncapital case, that the executions in Maryland averaged $37 million per execution, it's $23 million in Florida, it's $185 million in California, and, you know, California's system is completely crazy.  There's 734 people on the row, right, hundreds that don't have lawyers, who have been sentenced to death.  And there are some pretty good death penalty lawyers there, but there are also some that are not very good. And we can't fund it.  I mean, why would you put all this money into propping up a system where they have no persuasive evidence of deterrence, right, that we need all this money to finance an underfunded criminal justice system that has so much to be fixed, particularly when it comes to forensic science?\", '[unintelligible] wait a second.  John, John.', 'I have a [unintelligible] --', '-- but let me -- let me --', '-- but let\\'s get to the heart of it now, because let me see if I just heard what our opponents are saying.  They\\'re saying, \"The last people to ask about whether the death penalty is going to make you safer are police chiefs\"?', 'No?  Well, Kent certainly did.  He said, \"Ask the line cop.\"  Here\\'s the point.  The reason why police chiefs, who as Diann pointed out very frequently would count in the votes, they say, \"Are you for or against the death penalty in principle or for moral purposes?\" and they would say, \"Yes.\"  But if you ask police chiefs, \"Should we have the death penalty now?\" as a public policy matter, they\\'d say, \"No.\" And the reason they\\'d say, \"No,\" are all the issues that we\\'ve raised in this debate about public policy, that they see no evidence of deterrence, it\\'s extremely expensive, it\\'s taking away resources they need to keep your community safe, right?  What they need to have good crime labs, to have good police officers, to have good training, to make the community safe, they are saying, \"This is not helping us, it\\'s hurting us.\"', \"That has to be respected. Male Speaker: I just wanted clarification from Robert on -- it's related to the media.  And our notion of prison is not the research notion that you have, and I think perhaps you might have taken it for granted that it is a cushy type of -- that sentence, waiting period.  Please clarify that.  And also --\", \"I'd like to just --\", \"--what the questioner said is very important because something that should be corrected. I understand, Bob, that in your view life in maximum security prisons is not harsh enough punishment for people, and you've described what you think would be harsher punishment, but I can tell you from all the clients I've represented, all these exonorees that I've talked with about what their prison experiences were like and some knowledge of maximum security prisons and familiarity with the literature, it's a terrible place to be.  You wake up every morning.  You have no idea who's going to kill you and when. You walk into the lunchroom.  You look at somebody wrong, you can get stabbed.  I mean, there are gangs in prison.  There's horrible violence in prison.  You know, they should be safe, and that is why the correction people, Bob, tell you that they're interested in keeping it safe and that is their job.  And so the whole characterization of maximum security prison is, you know, Club Fed or something -- [laughter] Barry Scheck: -- it's just really misleading and wrong. [applause]\", \"Well, I think your -- both parts of your question, I think, kind of make our point on the issue of deterrence, which is -- that's what the studies show.  I mean, that there is no evidence that you can deter somebody that is going to commit a murder for irrational reasons -- many homicides and family situations.  That's not how deterrence works, and you don't get it from the threat of capital punishment. And so, you know, that's --\", '-- so, capital punishment is not the answer on the issue of deterrence.', 'Let\\'s not be abstract.  Shuja Graham, Byron Halsey, please stand.  I want you to see these two people.  This is not the cost of doing business.  This is not collateral damage. Shuja Graham was sentenced to death in California for murder in prison.  He was exonerated in 1981.  He has been out since then.  He is vice-chair of the group Witness for Innocence.  Byron Halsey, my dear friend, was convicted of murder, a crime that -- in New Jersey -- I think, our opponents would immediately say, \"This should have been a death penalty crime.\" Two children that -- of Byron\\'s girlfriend were found murdered in a basement, one with a nail in her head, one sexually assaulted.  He was tried and convicted.  He was miraculously saved from the death penalty by one juror who was probably motivated by a conscientious objection to the death penalty.  But DNA evidence, after 22 years in prison, demonstrated that Byron was innocent and identified the person who really committed the crime.  So, don\\'t tell me that there isn\\'t an unacceptable risk of executing the innocent.  It\\'s been demonstrated -- the Innocence Movement has demonstrated it. It\\'s not just the 326 DNA exonerations that they can\\'t refute.  It\\'s not just the over 1,500 exonerations from the Registry of -- including non-DNA cases.  We now know that our system is riddled with error.  You go to Europe.  60 percent of people there still think capital punishment is a morally appropriate sanctioned for the most heinous of crimes. But they don\\'t trust the state to get it right.  And that is what we have to come to terms with in this country -- you can\\'t start saying, \"We can fix it.  We can make it perfect,\" when nobody\\'s willing to put up the money, and it\\'s an impossible task to begin with. Capital punishment is a government program.  Skepticism is in order.

      "[\"Well, I'm afraid I don't have anything good to say about any of the recent ones, but I do always tell people that Warren G. Harding gets a bad rap. [laughter] It's time America forgave him for teapot dome.\", 'The distinguished and charming Deborah Pearlstein.', 'Thank you.  The president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without Congressional authorization, or to put tonight\\'s debate resolution another way, the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.  You may have heard that second formulation before.  It\\'s how candidate Obama described the limits of presidential war powers when he was asked about it during campaign 2008.  And it came up a lot about three years later when President Obama unilaterally launched a seven-month bombing campaign against Libya.  Not only was there no actual or imminent threat to the nation in that case, but 10 days into the bombing, the president\\'s own secretary of defense went on Meet the Press and admitted that Libya wasn\\'t a vital interest to the United States. The president took us into our latest war in the Middle East, the ongoing conflict against ISIS, last August.  Here again there was no imminent threat.  \"We have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland,\" President Obama told the country in his nationally televised address, and yet he waited six months and over 2,000 airstrikes before he got around to sending a draft request for authorization to Congress, along with a cover note insisting that existing statutes provide me with all the authority I need to wage war anyway.  The central basis for that claim, as Professor Bobbitt notes, is the 2001 AUMF, the resolution that Congress passed three days after 9/11 empowering the president to take military action against \"those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11th attacks, or harbored those who did.\" Now, not exclusively, but principally, obviously, al-Qaeda and the Taliban.  And judging by what the people in Congress said about it at the time, the people who passed it certainly didn\\'t think they were committing the United States to open-ended, multi-generational war.  Now, nearly 14 years later, this war has gone on 10 years longer than World War II, four years longer than Vietnam, and counting.  Under the 9/11 AUMF President Obama has launched six times the number of drone strikes as President Bush against groups with evermore tenuous and remote connections to the language -- to the resolution\\'s language and original target.  Two years ago Obama officials told the Washington Post that they were increasingly concerned that the law is being stretched to its legal breaking point. That was before they\\'d stretched it still further.  President Obama now argues that the 9/11 AUMF allows him to go after -- go to war with groups like ISIS that have not just distanced themselves from al-Qaeda, but have been denounced and excommunicated by al-Qaeda.  It may even allow, and the theory -- the administration\\'s theory of the 2001 AUMF, it may even allow him to go after ISISs offshoots and sympathizers as so-called associated forces of a force that al-Qaeda refuses to associate with.  Earlier this month at a Senate hearing, President Obama\\'s new secretary of defense acknowledged that the resolution may be broad enough to allow the president to wage war in Nigeria against Boko Haram, which recently pledged allegiance to ISIS on Twitter. In fact, the administration\\'s interpretation of the 9/11 AUMF is so broad they can\\'t tell you how broad it is.  For one thing, who we\\'re at war with is classified.  In testimony last May, the Pentagon\\'s general counsel told the Senate that which groups the administration claims legal authority to target under the AUMF, well, that\\'s something that they\\'re \"just not prepared to discuss in an open session.\"  Meanwhile, Obama administration officials admit that there\\'s no end in sight to worldwide war making.  The war on terror will go on \"at least 10 to 20 years more,\" which means, I suppose, that in 2032, when we\\'re all filled with excitement about the impending presidential contest between Chelsea Clinton and George P. Bush -- [laughter] -- we can rest assured that the winner will get to use the September 2001 AUMF as the basis for his or her presidential kill list.  This is not how constitutional democracies are supposed to make the most important decision that any society can make.  President Obama has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization, but it\\'s worse than that.  The arguments he\\'s advanced will make it even easier for future presidents to do the same.  I urge you to vote, \"Yes,\" on the motion.  Thank you. [applause]', \"Yeah, the notion that all they did was change their name is not right, as Deborah's pointed out. I'd also say that, as she pointed out, the ISIS strategy is to focus on the near enemy.  Al-Qaeda's strategy is to focus on the far enemy.  The fact that ISIS has local apocalyptic and monstrous goals may explain -- and the fact that they're locally focused probably helps explain why evey major figure in the national security establishment, from the chairman of the joint chiefs to two heads of the National Counterterrorism Center, has said that there is no evidence that ISIS has plans or major capability to attack the homeland.\", 'Well, as Deborah said, the bulk of the war powers are with Congress.  The declare war clause, which Madison identified as the part of the Constitution, where the most wisdom was to be found, is an independent check on -- or it was intended to be an independent check on presidential ability to initiate war.  All the -- you know, most of the framers who spoke about this power, James Wilson, the architect of the presidency, said, \"This system will not hurry us into war.  It is calculated to guard against it.\" And he identified the declare war clause as the clause he was talking about.  George Washington wasn\\'t sure he had the power to launch offensive operations against Indians without an authorization from Congress.  So this was an important check.  Moreover, where does the president get the power?  The president doesn\\'t get the power from the commander in chief clause, and Alexander Hamilton said that was -- that meant nothing more than that he was the first general and admiral of the United States, and generals and admirals don\\'t get to decide whether and with whom we go to war.', \"You don't need the magic words, you didn't -- it was recognized from the first generation that you did not need formal authorization.  You need some kind of substantive authorization that perhaps is renewed more than once a generation.\", \"You've mentioned that clause several times, and the actual history of that --\", \"-- no, the actual history of that clause was the Bush administration's original draft of the AUMF gave the president the power to deter and -- an independent power to deter and preempt all future acts of terrorism against the United States. That was so horrifying to a Congress, even in the aftershock of 9/11, that they changed that language to dis-link [spelled phonetically] that as an independent power.\", 'He has the power to go after persons or organizations linked to 9/11 for the purpose of --', \"Well, they're shooting at each other.\", 'I think the president has residual powers under Article II to deal with -- you know, Deborah mentioned the phrase, \"Repelling sudden attacks,\" which comes up at the Constitutional Convention.  And I think you can be flexible with that.  I don\\'t think you have to be wedded to an 18th century understanding, or one that doesn\\'t comport with modern warfare.  But you do have to -- for the president to legitimately use this reserved Article II power, it has to actually be a threat to the country.  And it --', '-- [unintelligible] --', 'Not in the remotest sense.', 'Well, you just said --', \"-- Professor Amar was doing a lot better than Secretary of Defense Gates in that he was able to make that argument with a straight face. [laughter] When Gates, once in Congress and once on 60 Minutes, tried to sell the idea that launching thousands of Tomahawk missiles at another sovereign country wasn't war, he had to smirk. That was the line he was given to sell and he did not sell it.\", 'Yeah.', \"Well, you know, it's hard to discern, but a quarter of his mouth turned up.\", \"Well, the administration has changed its own criteria for what it includes in associated forces, a term that doesn't appear anywhere in the AUMF.  It used to require co-belligerency with al- Qaeda.  ISIS is not a cobelligerent with al-Qaeda.  It's an organization that is not only in competition with al-Qaeda, but at times actively fighting al-Qaeda affiliates.  So, you know, I think at some point you have to read that organization out of the definition.  And they were concerned about the legal basis for this and how open-ended it was two years before they shifted to expand their own definition to allow ISIS in.  Before the --\", '-- yes --', \"-- the Obama administration attorneys were -- there was a -- you know, from what you -- from what you can tell from public accounts of it, a pretty fiery debate over whether they had the authority, even before ISIS came on the scene, to stretch the law as far as they'd already stretched it.\", \"There's a long history of Congress's feeling compelled to continue wars and to provide funding for wars that the president has launched.  In Libya, as I recall, there was no specific -- separate appropriation for the Libyan conflict.  It came out of the Overseas Contingency Fund.  And what's more, the House actually voted down authorization.  At some point, when you say the president can go and wage war wherever he wants and if Congress funds it, that's fine, you've sort of turned the Constitution on its head.  You've put all the checks that are supposed to stand in the way of unilateral action, and then Congress -- and then the president's action stands unless -- as you know, in the Vietnam War, there's an actual effort to defund it.  I think that puts -- that makes things exactly backwards.\", 'Actually, this debate is about whether the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without Congressional authorization.', \"I didn't say that.\", \"Professor Bobbitt, you have a pretty broad view of what appropriations authorize.  If I -- looking at the Foreign Policy article that you -- that is on the Intelligence Squared website, I believe you said in 2013 that the very fact that Congress funded bunker busters meant that they couldn't be surprised if the president decided to launch them against Syria.  Isn't that a pretty broad view of -- it's sort of if I lease my -- if I give my employee a company car I should not be able to complain if he takes it on a joyride.\", 'If he uses it to invade another country?', 'Thank you.  To agree with our opponents on tonight\\'s motion you\\'d have to accept some pretty extraordinary propositions.  You\\'d have to believe that the president has not just the power to repel sudden attacks, but the right to launch them.  You\\'d have to accept the proposition that three days after September 11, Congress delegated its war powers to the president in near perpetuity, one Congress, one vote, one time; and that that war can be conducted for decades to come on a need-to-know basis with minimal public debate.  You\\'d have to swallow the notion that seven months of regime change bombing in Libya isn\\'t war for constitutional purposes.  It isn\\'t even hostilities under the war powers resolution, so long as -- and this is the actual argument they\\'ve made, the administration that is -- it\\'s not hostility so long as the country we\\'re bombing can\\'t easily hit us back. That last one has what I think are pretty staggering implications in an age of remote controlled warfare.  It\\'s also, I have to say, a somewhat grotesque doctrine for a humane, internationalist president to advance.  Put starkly, it says, \"Killing a bunch of foreigners isn\\'t war; war is what happens when actual Americans might get hurt.  Then it\\'s serious.  You might even need congressional authorization, unless, of course, our president thinks there\\'s an emergency threat to our humanitarian values, as in Libya.  Well, our constitutional values demand debate and authorization before the resort to deadly force.  They demand a vote.  Tonight, please vote, \"Yes,\" on the motion, \"The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.\"  Thank you.']\n",
      "[\"If I had to sum it up, I'd say they expected that the legislature would actually want to legislate. [laughter]\", 'Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, it\\'s a pleasure to be here, and thank you for the opportunity.  The president has certainly exceeded his constitutional power by waging war without Congressional authorization for the following reasons. First, as Nick Rosenkranz mentioned at the top, the text of the Constitution, the history, are actually quite clear on the idea that power over armed forces, power to commit those troops, to make war wherever they do it, is shared between the executive and the Congress.  The executive would have the power as commander in chief to superintend the armed forces.  He would also have the power to repel sudden attacks in the event our nation came under attack, but the vast majority of the power over the armed forces, and over war making in the United States, if you look in the Constitution, it\\'s there under Article I Section 8.  It\\'s given to Congress. They have the power to raise and support an army, to provide and maintain a navy, to issue letters of mark and reprisal, an old fashioned way of saying to appoint agents or to hire agents of the U.S. government, who would carry out lesser military actions against our enemies. And of course, Congress also has the power to declare war.  The reason this matters, the text matters, is because the purpose of the framers was also clear.  The president would have the power to act in our national defense if it was necessary, but actually commencing war, risking huge sums in national blood and treasure, that no one man should have the power to do. Madison said, \"In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive.  The trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man.\"  Now, my opponents will tell you that it\\'s not so much what the text of the Constitution says, or even why the Constitution said it that way, but what matters is what we\\'ve actually done, and in particular, what presidents have actually done in the past, say, 50 or 60 years of the nation\\'s history, because before that they almost always went to Congress to at least get an authorization for the use of force. So, let\\'s set aside for the moment the notion that it\\'s a little bit of a weird way to interpret the Constitution by saying, well, it means whatever the president has been doing, and thinks he can get away with, in every -- any given administration.  Let\\'s set that aside for a minute.  Let\\'s also set aside the problem of that methodology, which is how do we decide we agree on what particular presidents did, and more importantly, why they were doing it.  Were they acting in national defense or did they have a clear sense even in their own minds of what the purpose was for deploying force in a given case?  Let\\'s set both of those aside for now and make it clear that no president in the United States has declared or asserted an unlimited power to make war without congressional authorization.  The Office of Legal Counsel -- right, this is the office in the Department of Justice that counsels the president on how much power he has to use force abroad -- recognizes in its memoranda limits that the president has to follow when he uses force without congressional authorization. And even this president, his OLC said \"Look, you can only do this without Congress if it\\'s in the national interest, and if the force that you\\'re using is less than war.\"  Why does it matter?  Well, of course, because the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war.  So if what you\\'re doing is actual war, then you actually have to go to Congress.  How do you tell the difference between what\\'s war and what\\'s not war by this president\\'s own metric?  Well, in Libya, the last time he used force without congressional authorization, he said it was because, this is a short term commitment, right?  We\\'re not going to be there very long.  We\\'re going to get in.  We\\'re going to get out.  We\\'re going to have a very limited mission, right?  Just protecting civilians pursuant to a U.N. Security Council Resolution, and there will be minimal risk to Americans in any event, right?  The problem today is that the conflict against ISIL in Iraq and Syria is, even by the president\\'s own metric, war, in a constitutional sense. The president said when he committed troops, when he expanded our operations in Iraq and Syria, that this is going to take some time.  He announced a broad mission.  Our mission is not to protect particular individuals or even keep the peace.  Our mission is broadly to destroy and degrade another organization, ISIL, the \"Islamic State\" as it calls itself.  By January of this year, the United States had carried out close to 10,000 airstrikes in the region; we have 7,000 contractors in our employee -- in our employ on the ground; and 4,500 military personnel already serving in the theater.  \"Okay,\" my opponents will say, \"but that\\'s fine.\"  So what matters is not even so much what the president has done in the past.  What matters is what works.  We need the flexibility.  The president needs the ability to respond to new threats, to new dangers.  And that does matter.  But in this case, that\\'s not what\\'s going on. There has been more than enough time, there remains enough time for Congress to authorize the use of force.  Indeed, the president has gone to Congress and asked it to authorize the use of force in the case of ISIL.  There is plenty, further, of strategic cause for Congress to authorize force.  Congressional authorization is an incredibly important signal.  It signals our allies that we\\'re serious about the fight.  It signals our enemies that we\\'re serious about the fight.  And it signals, particularly in a conflict like this, to what our security friends call, \"Wavering neutrals in the region,\" right?  Those folks who looked at what we did in the past conflicts, they looked at Abu Ghraib, they looked at Guantanamo, they said, \"I don\\'t buy the United States,\" and it shows them we\\'re as good as our word.  For all of these reasons, the framers thought so; it remains a good idea.  You need to vote for the resolution.  Congress needs to authorize the use of force.  Thank you.', \"Sure.  So I find the notion, to use the word, absurd.  The text of the authorization for the use of force doesn't name them.  Congress never conceived that ISIL was the group that they meant to be authorizing force -- again, in part, because ISIL and even Al-Qaeda in Iraq -- as it used to be called by the United States -- didn't exist in 2001.  And this group, just because it once had some association with Al-Qaeda that did exist in 2001, isn't it.  You know, the United States is an offshoot of Great Britain in some fundamental way, but I'd like to think, after a certain time and a certain set of disagreements, you can tell the difference --\", '-- between one and another.', \"I don't.  In fact, it's not just a name.  It's a fundamental mission.  So, when Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and before, Osama Bin Laden named the United States its primary enemy.  He declared war against the United States.  He attacked the United States repeatedly.  He viewed the United States and its political operations and factions in the Middle East as the source of the problem. ISIL is in essence an apocalyptic cult.  They fight the United States today for the same reason that they fight al-Qaeda today, because they believe that they are not true believers of Islamism in the way they believe it should be practiced, and they do not take the United States as its enemy per se any more than they take anyone else.  In other words, its not just the name thats different, the mission of the group --\", 'There might be some limits to that proposition, right?  The president determines, he alone.  So if the president determines alone in a fit of pique that China is in fact now al-Qaeda, right, does the authorization for the use of military force to authorize the president to go after those who attacked us on 9/11 authorize the president to use force against anyone?', \"We detained people in Guantanamo who were from China.  We let them go actually not all that long ago, right?  So the notion that there are some of the same people in some of these same places I think is insufficient to establish what the administration says, which is not that ISIL is an associated group of al-Qaeda or an off-shoot, but that ISIL is al-Qaeda, right?  The administration can't say they're an associated force.  ISIL and al-Qaeda are shooting at each other.\", 'Which court has held that --', \"If I took everything that Congress does as proof of its constitutionality, I would have to challenge, right, Marbury versus Madison.  Just because Congress has passed a law doesn't mean the law Congress has passed is constitutional.\", 'I think --', \"-- I don't think -- Congress's authorization -- Male Speaker: Does it violate the text -- Deborah Pearlstein: -- for the use of funds is constitutional, but I don't think we can take their authorization for the use of funds as a commentary on whether or not they think the president has the power to wage war without congressional authorization.\", 'The language isn\\'t linked.  The language is responsible for the attacks of 9/11. And I want to come back to the question that was posed here a minute ago, which is \"Why is it that we should have -- and we all agree, right, some congressional authorization is required -- the notion is, \"Well, you don\\'t have to say specifically who the enemy is, right?  The enemy can be al-Qaeda, the Taliban, associated forces, people responsible for the attacks of 9/11, or whoever, right?  The reason why you need Congressional authorization and the reason why you have to name who the enemy is, is the same.  It is in order for Congress to have a meaningful check in a democracy.  You can\\'t lead a people into war without telling them who they\\'re going to war against and why.  So --', \"-- that's why naming the enemy is as important --\", '-- as the authorization in the first place.', \"I don't think I was suggesting Congress passed a --\", \"I'm saying the statute is entirely constitutional.  And all three branches of government have concluded that the statute authorized the use of force against three groups -- al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces.  ISIL is not the Taliban.  The administration says they're not associated forces, because after all, they're fighting with each other.  The administration says they're Al-Qaeda, and I'm telling you, there's no sense in which they're Al-Qaeda.  And I'm not the only one who says that, because I'm after all, not that persuasive, right?  You've got to read the West Point Counterterrorism Center report.  You've got to read, actually, a wonderful piece in the Atlantic about who ISIL is.  And no matter what the president says, at some level, there's got to be a recognition of who we're talking about.  And this isn't it.\", \"I haven't --\", '-- [unintelligible] that it -- [unintelligible] --', '-- what federal court is it that has --', '-- opined on ISIS?', \"They didn't talk about ISIL at all. It didn't exist then.\", \"I think maybe we might agree.  I think for present purposes especially there's no constitutional difference between declaring war against ISIL and authorizing the use of force against ISIL. In either event, depending on the terms of the authorization for the use of force, Congress could of course impose a limitation, right?  The president can't use ground troops, for example, but assuming the authorization for the use of force in the statute didn't authorize anything different, I think they have the same effect in this case.\", \"Actually -- right, so I don't quite agree with that.  Right, so and let's take practice and current authorization of which Professor Amar is so fond, right, to invade Afghanistan and to detain an intern over the course of that war, and indeed the broader war with al-Qaeda, tens of thousands of prisoners.  And we repeatedly -- and Congress embraced this, the president embraced this, the courts have embraced it -- repeatedly invoked the international law of war, international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, exactly those laws.  So if we thought it required a declaration of war as such to do that, everything we've done more or less [unintelligible].\", 'To --', 'So, the United States has an obligation under its treaty commitments, which after the supreme law of the land, and to observe that law of war in any armed conflict, and it would say it applied here.', 'No.', 'Indeed. It would render --', \"-- the declare war clause and the associated clauses there, effectively moot.  If all Congress had to do to authorize war was appropriate funds, then why include a declare war power at all? What would the point of that ever be?  And we just talked about how perfecting it, in the sense of international law, can't be it.  In fact, the administration itself doesn't make the argument that the funds Congress has appropriated for military action, part of which -- a large part of which at the beginning was in defense of our own assets in the region, to the extent that they were being attacked.  The president himself says the conflict has gone much beyond that now. But the president himself doesn't rest on that.  He says he rests on his Article II Authority and then he asks Congress for additional authorization, which is why the House and Senate are debating the need for a new authorization now.\", \"Well, is he right about, it'll depend what the new authorization says?  It'll certainly depend what the new authorization says, right, but part of the necessity for a new authorization, and indeed I think part of the reason, and I know we're not debating the administration, but the fact is even the president, if we are deferring to his judgment, thinks we should have a new authorization. Part of the purpose for that is to clarify exactly what we're doing and against whom we're doing it.  And I think the sort of notion that the 2001 AUMF was sufficient to get us through pretty much anyone in that messy Middle East because they're close enough is not only a legal error, it's a strategic error of the most profound sense. We don't want to lump them together.  They're different groups, and if we do that we only strengthen both of them.  I think it's that strategic error that the president is most worried about.\", 'Thank you.  So I would like to know the names of the members of ISIL that were part of al- Qaeda when it attacked us at 9/11.  The leader of ISIL, al-Baghdadi, right, was radicalized when the United States invaded Iraq after 9/11, another nation that was not responsible for the attacks of 9/11.  I think the fundamental point as this, right?  There is a difference between al- Qaeda and ISIL, enough of a difference that there needs to be new authorization, and the president himself, the expert that Professor Bobbitt suggests we look to first, agrees with that, which is why he has gone to Congress. More broadly, the framers of the Constitution wanted it to be hard to go to war.  They imposed a series of checks in order to make it hard.  We were going to have appropriations for military funding in the full view of God and everyone every two years.  The Constitution requires it. Now we fund military operations substantially through funding contractors; through different departments, the funding is hidden.  They wanted citizens to be -- to serve in the military. These days about .5 percent of Americans serve in the military.  80 percent of us support the troops, 90 percent of us can\\'t find Afghanistan on a map.  Congress and Congress\\'s ability to say, \"This is the war we want to fight, these are the reasons, these are the people\" -- Congress is one of the last and most significant checks we have of limiting, constraining, in any way slowing the march to war that we might otherwise be inclined to take. The president has asked Congress to help us define what that war is.  We should keep this one last check.  You know, I was briefing some young Congressional staffers last week on what this would mean if they passed a new authorization.  And they despaired of Congress taking any action.  You can tell them, \"It\\'s not despairing.  We think you should take action.\"  Vote for the resolution in this debate.']\n",

      "['I meant that there are limits to snooping, collecting and making my private life public on Google.', 'The eminent professor Eric Posner from Chicago University Law School.', 'Thank you very much.  Thank you.  So let me say, first of all, I\\'m not here on an official mission from the European Commission to turn America to this notion of law.  It\\'s more the academic pleasure and the opportunity to come to Manhattan and discuss with these great American thinkers.  And I will just report to you how this works in Europe and where it comes from.  So, first of all, the \"Right to Be Forgotten,\" the words, the natural words, they don\\'t tell you the whole story, because actually it is about a deletion right. It is about you exercising control over personal data, you asking big corporations or the state to delete this data which they have about you. Why this is important?   It is important because it allows you to control your own life. In the language of the German constitutional court, already from the \\'70s, this was called informational self-determination, and the judges said in a democracy, in a free country, you as an individual must have the right to control what others know about you.  You must be able to ask What do you have? and you must be able to ask for deletion, of course within reason.  You cannot ask a doctor to delete the medical records, because the doctor must keep them either to show what he has done or she has done in terms of liability.  Of course you can\\'t ask the press to delete a bad review if you are a concert pianist, or for that matter if you are someone who has done malpractice or if you are a politician.  There are limits to this, which are limits which are important in a democratic society, because that\\'s what you will hear from the other side, that this is an attack on democracy.  We see that differently in Europe. We believe democracy needs both.  It needs privacy.  It needs the ability of the individual to decide himself or herself what the state in particular knows about them, because if you don\\'t have the privacy, how can you organize dissent?  How can you organize a new political party, which maybe wants to [unintelligible], if already the government always knows everything about you.  So, we need privacy in a free society as we need free speech, and therefore, and now I turn to the recent judgment.  First of all, you have to understand this just doesn\\'t fall from the sky like this, but it is application of existing law which we have in Europe since 1995.  And it is basically a right to ask a big corporation to delete information about you.  Google argued in the case, This doesn\\'t apply to us.  We are not what we call in Europe a data controller.  Our judges saw that differently. They said sure, you control data about individuals and you profile them. When you put in the name of an individual, Google gives you more than anything else, any other source of information about this person, and our law requires that in the same way that our people can ask data brokers, the bank, you know, they can ask in school after a certain time for things to be deleted, they should be able to ask Google for deletion.  Now, the person in question who brought this case from Spain, he had not paid some social contributions and therefore his house had been confiscated and it was a legal obligation in Spain to have a publication in a newspaper of this fact in order to make the auctioning of the house to cover the social contributions better and attractive for the Spanish state, because if it\\'s in the newspaper there will be more people bidding for this house. So, the court said you cannot ask the newspaper to take down the information because they have a legal obligation to publish, but Google you can ask.  And this is a principle which also applies when it comes to free speech and democracy.  It may well be that Google has to put things -- take things down, but it doesn\\'t mean the information disappears.  It will stay in the newspaper.  It stays on the website of the newspaper of the BBC, of the television station, all this stays around, but Google is subject to the same law of self-control of information, of self-determination of individuals, which allows them to ask first what do you have about me and second, please delete.  Does it work?  Yes, it works well.  I just last week met the chief privacy officer of Google.  He told me that now they are dealing with these requests in real time.  In the beginning there were around 200,000 requests and they had to employ a number of new staff to deal with this, but now it works well. There are practically no complaints which do go to the court.  Google has understood the European law of balance between privacy and free speech.  The decisions, you know, in the beginning very contested.  I think in the meantime everybody says this is working well.  And finally, this is something which is important for the future, because more and more data about you will be collected in the digital age, in the internet age, in the age of ever stronger censors, wearables, internet of things and so on.  So, when you think tonight about the motion, think about these new censors.  Think about the Apple watch. Think about the department store in Manhattan which now follows you on your mobile phone wherever you stand.  All this is collected and recorded and there are address dealers and information dealers which have files on you with between 200 and 2,000 parameters, about every person. And these files, they are sold. For example, in a political campaign.  Those who have more money, they can buy these files and target you as a voter.  If you say, \"I as an individual want to have control over my data and what\\'s happening to them and I want my children to have control, and I want to have, as a parent, control over what happens to data of my children, then you should vote in favor of the motion:  \"The U.S. Should Adopt the \\'Right to Be Forgotten\\' Online.\"  Last remark:  You already have it in some parts of the United States, in some parts of law.  For example, in California, there is now a law which gives the possibility for parents to say, and children when they become 18, to wipe out everything until they were 18.  In the Fair Credit and Reporting Act about your credit, information which is older than seven years, you can ask to be deleted. So it is already there in part, and the federal trade commissioner, Julie Brill just yesterday said, Wes, this is what we need in America, a right to obscurity.  Thank you very much.', 'I heard this very clearly.  This would be a tool for dictators.  And our moral standing would be undermined if we allow this right to be exercised in democratic societies. I would see it exactly the other way around.  History has taught Europeans, whether fascistic dictators or communist dictators they don\\'t want any privacy.  They wanted to know everything about you.  There was a block reporter in every block of housing.  And that is the history of this right you have to think about.  Dictators don\\'t want anybody to have privacy.  So, I think the understanding where we are coming from is different, and I would like to, like Jonathan, distinguish this notion from other things you might be thinking about.  The notion here tonight is not the US should adopt the EU \"right to be forgotten\" as ruled by the European Court of Justice exactly.', \"It's not censorship because the state is not making information disappear as they did in the communist and the Nazi dictatorships. It's an individual who wants to have control over their past lives --\", 'I can --', 'Yes, I think what Andrew and Jonathan are doing here is they\\'re pretending that everybody who makes use of this right is someone with some public interest to know actually what this person has been doing and what it is about.  But that\\'s not the case. Most of these requests have -- more than 70 percent -- have nothing to do with public interest. So, I would like to say very clearly here, whenever there is a public interest of the nature which is important in a democracy to know, an interest in someone who stepped out, him or herself, into the public, the \"Right to Be Forgotten\" doesn\\'t apply.  The example, for example, which Andrew gave, from the Washington Post, namely that a concert pianist was asking for a takedown of the critique -- the bad critique of his piano performance here in America, yes, the person asked for it, but under our law it would never be right to take this down because this person hasstepped into the public arena.  So, I think honestly we have a fake debate here.  What we need to debate is the chilling effect on democracy and on public discussion.  What chilling effect is bigger, if we are able to know everything about you and even in a way which you wouldn\\'t even think of or whether we allow individuals to have control over the data. I give you one example what you\\'re not thinking of today. You\\'re not a very political person maybe but from time to time you push a like button on Facebook. [laughter] Paul Nemitz: Okay?  Because you have political thinking and a little bit -- but you don\\'t want to go out in public and say, \"I\\'m a Democrat,\" \"I\\'m a Republican.\"  Tomorrow Facebook will aggregate and map and link to your person the political profile from your Facebook buttons, whether you want it or not.  That\\'s the chilling effect.', \"Because when that's happening tomorrow, you will not even push the Facebook buttons anymore.  So, the issue here is what is more of a chilling effect on a democracy, if big corporations and the state can know everything about you and profile you in a way that you wouldn't even dream of thinking --\", '-- or giving you the right to deletion.', 'Not today, Jonathan.', 'But tomorrow, my friend.', 'Right?', \"Here we are in America.  The innovation of technology doesn't stop.\", \"I mean, these decisions have taken place since decades in normal press law in Europe. Because before the Google case, as I explained to you, we had the right to deletion and, for example, you know, newspapers they have to make on a daily basis a decision do we publish something or not, and if they get a request, for example, to correct or to take down from a website some information, they have to make this decision.  So, it's true that if you only read this one judgment, and that's normal in the law, you don't understand what these criteria mean.  But if you go to European court of human rights, for example, the Von Hannover case, very clear criteria.  What are they?  A) whenever the information is of relevant, of public interest in a democracy as a contribution to public debate, it cannot be taken down.  Second, when the person in question has made himself or herself the decision to go public, into a public sphere like, for example, the concert artist, the information cannot be taken down.  So, I would say Eric has said it right. All the many examples which you invoke of people who tried, I've heard here some examples, the guy who did the professional [unintelligible] the concert pianist who asked for critique to be taken down, all this under the law should not be taken down.\", 'On the other hand --', 'It is not different from any other newspaper previously.  Newspapers have to make these decisions --', \"Haven't heard about it.\", 'This judgment is specific to Google as a search engine.  Now, when -- and it distinguishes the law which applies to the search engine from the law which applies to the press -- to the newspaper, which was also part of the case.  So, for the time being, I would say it only applies to the search engine.  But when we get into the area of, you know, journalism, free speech, no.', 'All search engines.', \"It's not Google specific that the case was about Google. But, of course, there's something new with search engines in comparison to a normal press website.  And that is that the search engine, by profiling the individual, when you put in a name, bringing up all the information existing about this individual, goes far deeper in your privacy and profiles you much more than only the one website on which you have your stuff.\", 'Well, first of all, a data controller, as we call it, is not someone who collects information for private use. So, as long as you do this for private use you would not, in Europe, fall under our data protection law, but of course, to Google, it applies.  And indeed, for your question on the NSA, the data protection law applies without difference to the state and to private search engines.  So, the right to deletion and the right to ask what do you have about me in Europe applies to the state and also to corporations.  But of course, within reason national security limitations and so on, you know, there we are not so far apart.', \"Well, the answer is he described a case where he would, you know, as a developer for his private purposes design his own web engine, so this constellation would mean that you are not a controller, you would not be treated like Google and therefore the right to be forgotten would not apply in relation to you, because you're doing this as an individual. So, you would have to delete nothing.\", \"Well, Google as a private corporation is subject to the law as anybody else.  And, of course, its decisions can be checked.  So, if you ask that something to be taken down, and they don't take it down, then you have, in Europe, the possibility either to go to a court directly and then a judge will decide, or you can go to an independent data protection authority, which is something like an independent agency like the FTC, and they will order Google, if they think the request is justified, to take it down. But then Google has the possibility, like in Europe and in America, against the decision of the FTC to go to court. Male Speaker: But Paul  Paul Nemitz: This is an area -- this is an area which is subject to the law.  It's not a discretionary decision of Google, and that's, you know, the blue sky, and beyond that there's nothing.  Google is here in the same position as any other enterprise.  They operate in the realm of law and in Europe, like in the United States, in the end, the law is applied by judges.  And what Google does, by the way -- and I think that is good -- is also very much scrutinized by the fourth power.  It is good that the press is after Google and says, be more transparent, tell us what you're doing.  Tell us what the criteria are.  That is good.  And we totally support it.  I mean, of course, you know -- Male Speaker: Yeah, Paul, I have to -- [unintelligible].\", 'Ladies and gentlemen, I am defending the case that you should vote in favor of the notion the US should adopt a \"right to be forgotten,\" not necessarily the one of the EU, but a \"right to be forgotten.\"  Why should you vote for this notion?  Because technology moves on.  More and more information will be collected about you by the state and by private parties.  And your life will be plotted by them.  Your life will be profiled.  You will be predicted, and you will be manipulated unless you have a tool in law to control your own destiny. And in a free society, this right is the right to information of self-determination and it means for Google searches that you can ask for de-linking, provided there are no countervailing interests.  And, of course, the most important countervailing interest is democracy, free speech, the information which is relevant for our democracy to function. In the end, what we are discussing here is the power relation between you as an individual, as a free citizen of the United States and on the other hand the power of Google.  Is Google free to do anything in terms of plotting you, predicting you and manipulating you?  Or do you, as an individual, have standing and rights to defend your freedom?  That\\'s what you\\'re voting about tonight.  If you believe individuals should have their destiny in their hand, also in the times when technology make total prediction, total collection of anything you do possible, then tonight you should vote the US should adopt the \"right to be forgotten\" online. Thank you very much.']\n",
      "[\"No, they haven't, but I'm hoping they'll change their minds soon enough.\", 'Especially after tonight.', 'I\\'d like to ask you to cast your minds back 25 years, 30 years.  For those of you who are old enough, or some of the younger people here, I\\'ll just have to tell you what it was like then, when we enjoyed something called \"privacy.\"  And privacy is a complicated concept, so I want to convey it to you with a few examples.  So, imagine a 17-year-old boy, he\\'s arrested for selling drugs.  A news item appears in the local paper.  The police then realize they made a mistake, and they let him go.  That\\'s not published in the newspaper.  Now, the people around him in his neighborhood may know about this, they may not know about it.  They know a lot about this kid.  He moves on with his life.  It\\'s not a big deal.  Second example:  A single mom is depressed, she has -- her kids -- her hands full with her kids. She sees a psychotherapist, she misses some credit card bills, files for bankruptcy.  But bankruptcy gives her a fresh start.  She gets back on her feet, and she\\'s able to continue with her life.  Now, again, her friends and neighbors might know a bit about this, but they also know about her and what she\\'s like and how she is a good mother.  So, they know a little bit about what\\'s going on but they still have a relatively complete image of who she is.  A third example, a married couple has a terrible divorce.  They file for divorce in court.  They say terrible things to each other, flinging wild accusations, some of which may contain an element of truth, some of which is exaggerated.  They might refer to each other\\'s infidelity.  They might allege that the other spouse neglected the children or said bad things about them. Eventually the divorce is settled, and they move on with their lives.  So, in all these cases, these events happened.  They were public to some extent but at the same time they\\'re private.  Not everybody in the world or even outside this area hears about these events. And the law protects them.  There are privacy laws -- there were privacy laws, they still exist.  There are even laws called, \"expungement statutes,\" that would have allowed the teenager, for example, to erase his arrest record after a period of time had passed.  And although free speech was robust at that time, so were privacy rights.  People understood that while other people would have an interest in knowing things about you and talking about you, individuals also have an interest in controlling information about themselves, not necessarily political information, it could just be personal information, things that are embarrassing.  Now, I want you to imagine back then in 1990 that an academic -- a kooky academic like me or Jonathan came up with the following proposal. We would say, \"This is a terrible state of affairs that we have,\" because, after all, if a stranger meets someone -- let\\'s say it could be an employer or a creditor or a future romantic partner -- it\\'s really in the stranger\\'s interest to be able to know as much about this person as possible.  Maybe a future employer would want to know that this kid had been arrested.  Even if he wasn\\'t convicted, it\\'s still information that would be useful.  So to solve this problem of massive social ignorance, what we should do is record everything that everybody does, put it onto a searchable database, and make this database available to everybody in the world.  Okay, so if somebody had made a proposal, even someone like Jonathan, smart guy, or me, not so smart guy, we would have been laughed out of the room, that -- \"What a ridiculous proposal, what a tremendous invasion of people\\'s privacy.\"  But, of course, this is what\\'s happened.  It\\'s happened over the last 20 or 30 years, not because of a conscious decision by the public or by the government to implement this crazy recording system, but because of the development of the Internet. Now, what happened?  The law has remained the same, but a very important element of privacy back in the \\'80s and \\'90s and before then was simply the physical configuration of the environment.  It was just very difficult to collect information about people and disseminate it.  Okay.  That\\'s completely changed.  Technology has changed.  So the law at the time -- the privacy laws at the time could be relatively weak, and yet people\\'s privacy was adequately protected, but now, with this technological change, this old balance between my interest in controlling information about myself and your interest in knowing about me has been upset.  And all that the \"Right to Be Forgotten\" would do is restore this balance.  Okay, so, if we go through these three people again, this kid, 10, 15 years later -- let\\'s suppose all of this happened, you know, in the last few years -- he applies for a job, the employer puts his name in Google, first thing that comes up is this arrest. Now, the employer might understand that this is not important, but he might.  This is the only thing that comes up about this guy.  Why not pass him by and hire somebody else? Maybe the single mother\\'s friends, you know, in the \\'90s they would have gossiped when maybe today they would write about it on Facebook.  Maybe she would\\'ve written about it on Facebook or on a blog.  Now a potential romantic partner, employer, neighbor, colleague puts her name in -- maybe she moves to a new city -- puts her name in and immediately finds out that she had a mental illness.  That\\'s how she\\'s going to be defined to the public.  And in the case of the divorced couple, in the old days divorce would be public.  It\\'s public information.  But it was, you know, put in a file that was stored in the basement of a courthouse.  If you wanted to, you could find out about that information, but nobody had any interest at least with respect to ordinary people. Nowadays, you know, their children could type their parents names into Google and out comes these allegations.  And, of course, not only their children, but future employers, romantic partners, friends, colleagues, anybody in the world, anywhere they go.  So, they\\'ve lost control over this information about themselves and it\\'s not just that they\\'ve lost this control, they\\'ve lost the important context.  You know, the neighbors, the people in the neighborhood, they know the context of these events.  The strangers who do the Google search do not.  So, the right to be forgotten would simply restore us, at least partly, to this older period of time.  People were happy with the balance between privacy and speech in those days, and I think people would be happy with this balance again if privacy were improved somewhat.  So, for that reason you should vote in favor of the motion for the \"Right to be Forgotten\" Online in the United States.  Thank you very much. [applause]', 'Yes.  Censorship in the sense that Andrew used it -- uses it has always existed in this country.  There is a tort right to privacy.  If a nosey journalist pokes into your affairs, finds out true facts, tries to publish them, you have a tort action against them.  You can get damages as a --', 'You can just sue them and get money.  And -- [laughter] Eric Posner: As a consequence --', \"As a consequence of that, journalists do not do this.  Many of you have seen, on reality TV shows and other places that faces are blurred out.  Well, that's a kind of censorship as well.\", 'Not the subsequent.  But the original --', 'the original --', \"Yeah, just that the -- there is censorship in the sense that the government prohibits you from reporting true facts.  And the reason for that censorship is that there's also a strong interest in privacy.\", 'Here is another metaphor, so -- [laughter] Eric Posner: Well, for example --', 'Okay.  So the -- so --', 'I agree -- I agree with Jonathan.', 'I agree with Jonathan that the word \"censorship\" is not helpful here.  What the \"Right to Be Forgotten\" does is it raises the cost for strangers to find out information about you.  It doesn\\'t make it impossible.  So, if you turn out to be a famous important person, become a politician, journalists, biographers can dig it out.  It just makes it difficult.  But that\\'s the way things work.  That\\'s the way we secure our homes, for example.  We don\\'t make it impossible to break into our house.  That would be far too expensive.  We put in a lock that will deter most people.  It won\\'t deter people who are extremely interested in getting into our house. That\\'s -- so you raise the cost without making something impossible.  That\\'s a way of putting a thumb on the scale for privacy.', \"These complaints are generic in legal debates.  Every legal standard is ambiguous, so these old privacy rights, for example, require the government or the courts or juries to balance the public's interest in something, a vague term.  Relevance is a term that comes up over and again.  So, this happens and what happens is through repeated decision making it becomes clearer and clearer what the actual rules are.  Now, the rules as they're stated are vague, but when you actually read the cases it becomes pretty clear what's going on.  Ordinary people, non-famous people are the ones who win. Famous people don't win.  Ordinary people, and not ordinary people who commit crimes or serious crimes, and there's frequently a time component, you know, five, 10 years ago, and you can, by reading these things, get a pretty good sense of what the standard is and be able to make predictions about how Google will apply these standards in the future. It's just something that happens over and over again in the law and people are able to work with it.\", \"Well, the poor people, the non-elites that you're talking about, they don't have the resources to take out newspaper ads, pay journalists or PR people to plant stories.\", \"They're the most vulnerable people.  The --\", \"Yeah, but Google hasn't done that, you know?  If Google were held legally liable, maybe they would, right?  So, Google has not done that because they don't think that's the profit-making thing to do.\", 'It\\'s not unconstitutional.  So, the right of privacy already does this.  It already has the effect of deterring newspapers and other people from publishing true facts about you.  Expungement laws are statutes in most states that allow people\\'s criminal records to be erased that, you know, the facts are gone.  All of these statutes and legal norms have standards and criteria.  This is something that we can debate about, how strict the criteria would be, and I suspect Jonathan and I, you know, are very close together, meaning that he\\'s on our side.  For the -- [laughter] Eric Posner: -- you make a -- you know, for example, I would completely rule out public figures from using the \"Right to Be Forgotten,\" only private individuals, and only private individuals who didn\\'t commit a crime, that sort of thing. So, I do think we can -- that there are administrative criteria.  Now, often it\\'s very difficult to set up in advance precisely because we\\'re in a new world with new technology. And so you have to build it up through decisions.  That\\'s how our legal system works. And I expect that\\'s how it would work if the \"Right to Be Forgotten\" were implemented.', \"Well, those are different context.  That's in -- the Fourth Amendment is in the context of criminal investigations.  And, yeah, there's a Supreme Court opinion which says what you said but I suspect will be revised over time.  These constitutional norms are not fixed, they are basically made up by the Supreme Court over time.  And the Supreme Court has already signaled that it's going to reconsider many of these constitutional norms in light of new technology.  There's a case involving GPS, for example, where the courts understand that their old norms don't work in a world in which the police can tail people with GPS rather than physically tailing them with cars.  So, what the Supreme Court will need to do, going forward, is balance interests and free speech with interests in privacy. And in doing that, they'll come up with new norms that probably will respect both interests, the best that can be done.\", \"I think that would need to be public, because it was a huge public event in this country.  I do think that if some kids put a racist statement on Facebook and 30 years from now that came up I would be troubled by that, and the reason for being troubled by that is that people develop over time.  You know, the one thing that you do as a 17- year-old or 16-year-old doesn't define you for your life.  Even if you did something a lot more serious, committed a crime, for example, the problem is that when you're 50 now, the person who Googles you may well know nothing about what you've done over the last 33 years.  And they get this hit, and although one would wish that people would take into account the passage of time, I think it's human nature to jump to conclusions and assume that this 50-year-old person is the same as the 17-year-old.\", 'There are interests on both sides.', \"So, that's the classic rule for the law so that the interests on both sides --\", \"And they are vindicated, and what's on the side of disclosure is something far more powerful than the government.

And I just want to ask you to imagine again but this time that it\\'s you, that perhaps you\\'re going through hard times in your marriage if you are married, and perhaps you get involved in a divorce.  And divorces always work out a lot worse than people want.  People exaggerate.  They make allegations.  So, imagine it\\'s you, and your spouse says, falsely maybe, that you neglected the children or maybe a statement that you made about your own children that you wouldn\\'t want them to hear is repeated in the court documents.

      "['I--it\\'s funny.  I actually think of myself as fairly mild-mannered.  I mean, besides free speech, which I do get very worked up about, I mostly only get worked about how bad the \"Star Wars\" prequels were, the canceling of \"Firefly,\" and, of course, that people really don\\'t appreciate Beyonc enough.', 'The fabulous Kirsten Powers.', 'Let me start by whisking you back to a magical time -- 2001.  A conservative would have dismissed me as a liberal clich.  I was a floppy-haired, Burning Man regular, San Francisc-ite who turned down big law salaries to work for social justice. I had worked in refugee camps in Eastern Europe, for an environmental justice mentoring program in D.C., and for the ACLU of Northern California.  And most of all, I loved the First Amendment, the quintessential liberal cause -- or so I thought.  2001 was also the year I started working at FIRE, which proudly defends speech and academic freedom for speakers of any political stripe.  As soon as I started at FIRE, however, I was inundated with hundreds of pleas for help.  It wasn\\'t long before I learned this unfortunate truth: if you\\'re going to be censored on the modern college campus for your opinion, chances are you\\'re going to be censored by the Left.  And this is what we mean by the Left, and most Americans mean when we say \"Liberal\" these days, either people on the left side of the political spectrum or people who self-identify as liberals, and people to their left.  I have been -- I have seen so many crazy examples of politically- correct censorship. A student at Indiana punished just for publicly reading a book, a sorority sister forced to publicly repent for insensitivity for a Taco Tuesday event, and Yale students banned from calling Harvard students \"sissies\" on a t-shirt, which was a quote from F.  Scott Fitzgerald by the way.  This is heartbreaking to me and my teammate, since both of us consider ourselves liberals.  Of course there are many, quote, good liberals out there who still support free speech, both on and off campus.  These include former ACLU President Nadine Strossen, The Nation\\'s Michelle Goldberg, renowned First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams, and many more.  But one thing all of these liberals have in common is that they also believe that the campus liberals have become distressingly intolerant of dissent.  Take any hot topic in America today and I can point you to examples of students and faculty members getting in trouble for being on the conservative side of the issue.  Take abortion.  While FIRE has proudly supported the free speech rights of pro-choice students, we are far more likely to have to come to the defense of pro-life students.  How bad is it?  At Northern Kentucky University, a professor actually led her students to destroy a pro-life display. The display was only dozens of little white crosses to protest Roe V.  Wade.  At Dartmouth, a similar pro-life display -- this time involving tiny American flags, was considered so offensive that another student ran it over with his car.  That reckless censor -- have you any guess about what his politics were?  He had a COEXIST sticker on the back of his car. [laughter] Greg Lukianoff: Or take immigration.  At UCLA, a student group faced ferocious protest and a massive fine when they simply attempted to invite someone to come to campus to debate against their pro-immigration stance.  And though I\\'m an atheist, I have been horrified by repeated attempts to censor campus evangelicals.  Kirsten will tell you more about those cases.  Last year, campus liberals made national headlines for demanding that speakers they did not like be disinvited from campuses across the country.  This problem has been growing for years.  According to extensive research by FIRE, if you\\'re going to face a disinvitation push arising from campus, it\\'s about three times as likely it\\'s going to come from your left. This is especially shocking when you consider how rare it is for a conservative to be invited in the first place.  Last year\\'s commencement season saw 25 Democratic political figures speech -- speak at the commencements of 60 of America\\'s top universities.  And how many Republicans were invited to speak?  Zero.  And this statistic comes from Nate Silver\\'s decidedly non-conservative FiveThirtyEight website.  Some conservatives were invited to talk at universities outside the top 60, including Rutgers.  However, even there former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice bowed out after months of pressure from faculty and students.  Even mild satire from conservatives isn\\'t tolerated.  Take the case of Omar Mahmoud, a Muslim conservative at the University of Michigan.  When this past December, he wrote a satirical column poking fun at micro aggressions and privilege theory -- very mild.  He was not only fired from the student newspaper, but his dorm room door was vandalized.  This prompted famous liberal writer Jonathan Chait to criticize the rise of a new wave of political correctness. If Angus and Jeremy concede that there is a problem with free speech on campus, they may blame the massive corporatized modern university.  And on this we agree.  Much of the censorship does come from out-of-control administrators.  However, we must understand that liberals so thoroughly dominate the current academy, as Kirsten will show, that if they were serious about freedom of speech on campus, this kind of administrative outer -- overreach would not be possible despite liberal dominance on campus or maybe because of it.  55 percent of over 400 colleges surveyed last year maintain wildly unconstitutional speech codes while only 4 percent maintain codes that fully meet First Amendment standards.  And this in spite of nearly three dozen lawsuits against politically correct speech codes since 1989, successful lawsuits.  And we can\\'t forget that the tools that are most often to silence dissent on campus are the brain children of professors, including Katherine McKinnon, Mary Matsuda and Richard Delgado, all of whom were liberal leaders of the speech code movement in the 1980s. Though it gives me no joy to say it, you must vote in favor of the motion, yes, liberals do stifle intellectual diversity on campus.  Thank you.', \"I'll -- I think I can start with that.\", \"I mean, it was interesting to have your own research sort of cited, because when we watch how these codes are written, you know, as I said, they came from liberal thinkers, they came from the Catherine MacKinnons.  They are used disproportionally against conservative points of view consistently.  And the idea that, yes, absolutely, administrators are largely the big problem, and they have been, and I'd be willing to say that.  But the administrators themselves lean overwhelmingly left.  It's 96 percent donations to the Obama campaign came from --when you take staff and faculty together.  So, they're using the same tools.  And just -- and I really have to say, the -- I have seen genuinely heartbreaking case of things that you should never do to people coming from administrators that are very much left. There was the University of Wisconsin case where they were telling a student he couldn't have a Bible study meeting in his own room on his own time because people knew he was an Evangelical Christian.  They might find that offensive.  Again, I'm an atheist, but that's wrong.\", 'And --', \"-- there's something really important that I want to say, is that we're talking about how, you know, Jeremy was talking about the consistency of liberals.  And the kind of liberal that I grew up with and was one that adamantly believed in freedom of speech.  And Angus is good on freedom of speech, and we have a lot of cases on which we agree, but if the administration -- which overwhelmingly leans left -- if modern liberals were as good on free speech as the old '60s and '70s liberals were, as me and Angus are on these issues, these administrative overreach things, as I said in my statement, would be impossible.  Sometimes it's active, sometimes it's just complicit, but it's allowing the stifling of intellectual diversity.\", 'Oh, yes, we do.', 'Oh, Liberty, yeah.', 'Yeah, so --', '-- we have taken on religious university after religious university, but I like how people kind of play dumb on this particular issue, where it\\'s kind of -- Liberty University makes you sign a contract saying you essentially give up all your rights at the door.  What are we supposed to argue, that you don\\'t know -- or that you don\\'t know that you\\'re going to BYU and suddenly you\\'re like, \"Oh, my God, it\\'s Mormon.  It\\'s super Mormon.\" [laughter] Greg Lukianoff: You have the right to give up some free -- to agree to that. I would never attend any of these schools.  But I want to point out we take on religious schools all the time and for that matter we\\'re coming out with a list of worst schools for freedom of speech.  One of the schools that we\\'re going to be listing -- and I\\'ll -- and you\\'ll have to wait to see why -- is Georgetown University, a Catholic university in D.C. Wait a week to see the article, but, yes, we take on religious schools all the time.  But, yes, if you tell people, you give up your rights on the door and you agree to that, then you have the right to do that.  Meanwhile, at Yale and Harvard and Princeton, the big schools that people would mean when they\\'re talking about higher education, they all promise free speech to high heaven, and they should be held to those promises.', 'Basically what we said is if they want to go to their donors and go to their students and say, \"Sorry, you know those glowing promises of free speech that we make?  Eh, we don\\'t really mean them.  We\\'re going with the civility idea,\" they are actually free to do that. And I -- and, you know, it\\'d be interesting to watch them try it, but they would start losing those professors and those donors in a heartbeat.  But they absolutely are free to do that.', 'book \"On Liberty,\" talks about civility.  And this is why you should always be concerned about calls for civility.  He points out that civility ends up getting defined by the people who are in charge.  And you\\'ll notice that when people argue for civility, they tend to actually believe that whatever they say is civil.  And if they\\'re angry about it, it\\'s righteous rage. But if you say it and it\\'s kind of sharp or mean, then it\\'s incivil [spelled phonetically]. And this -- this is the one of the reasons why it is a problem that you have this incredible sort of liberal dominance on campus, is that you end up actually seeing, in some cases, what your point of view is as a -- and anybody opposing as being fundamentally uncivil. And sometimes, disagreement -- to be productive -- can\\'t be all that civil.', 'No.  That is absolutely not true.', 'She was censored in the transcript.  Okay.', 'So, part of the story that you\\'re missing is that when the -- when the students reported this, not only did they put a trigger warning at the beginning of the transcript of her speech and they didn\\'t just censor the N word.  They did -- they put \"expletive\" -- they put, brackets, \"N word.\" They also, when she referred to this as being crazy, they put brackets, \"ableist slur\" in there.  I mean --', \"No, this wasn't a student newspaper.  This was a transcript of the -- [talking simultaneously]\", \"They have the right to, but that's censorship.\", 'They literally censored it.  They literally took it out.  How is that not censorship?', 'I mean, they can choose to -- they can choose to do that.', 'I would say yeah. [talking simultaneously]', 'I have to go back the big boy pants argument that -- then.  I think you actually get in trouble on a campus for saying something that sexist, though.', 'But I want to be serious for a moment in addressing that.  Again, let\\'s talk about Emily Brooker.  She\\'s an evangelical Christian student trying to get her degree in social work at Missouri State University. She\\'s an evangelical, and she doesn\\'t believe in gay marriage, and she doesn\\'t believe in gay adoption.  She was told to do an activity where she would actually act gay in public, which she pretended she did, as part of her degree, and then she said, \"I\\'m never doing this again.\"  She put on her big boy pants, as it were, when she was asked to sign a petition as part of her class supporting gay adoption.  She fundamentally did not believe this was right.  She said she wouldn\\'t, and they brought her into the room, and they threatened her basically with being kicked out of the program unless she actually changed her point of view, unless she decreased the distance -- the difference between her and the administration.  There was a full investigation of this.  It was absolutely horrible, the extent to which they were intolerant of an evangelical Christian\\'s belief. But she did fight.  Then there\\'s also Ed Felkner, who was told he had to -- he actually had to -- he had to lobby for liberal causes at Rhode Island College or else not graduate. And what he -- when he actually said, \"Wait, I\\'m not a -- but I want to be in this field, but I don\\'t actually believe in any of these things,\" he was not given the option to actually lobby for causes he believed in.  The -- you\\'ve got to be really far gone if you think you have the power to compel people to take political stances they don\\'t actually believe in.', \"I wouldn't go to Liberty University.\", 'Oh, they absolutely do.', 'They absolutely do.  They\\'re a liberal idea based on sensitivity.  I think they\\'re well- intentioned.  I think a lot of speech codes ideas are well-intentioned.  But here\\'s my problem with trigger warnings.  I wrote a short book called \"Freedom from Speech,\" and I\\'m afraid that\\'s kind of where we\\'re headed.  And but -- and here\\'s -- and I can go to philosophical reasons why I think trigger warnings are dangerous.  But here\\'s the practical reason.  Because seven humanities professors wrote Inside Higher Education, saying, \"Oh, my God.  These are becoming expectations.  They\\'re not mandatory yet, but because they\\'re becoming expectations, I am receiving angry e-mails and angry letters from students and from administrators saying I better provide these.\" But guess what? It\\'s impossible to know what actually might trigger them --', \"Because it's sensitivity-based -- it's a sensitivity-based warning idea that is absolutely in line with all of the speech codes we've been talking about --\", '-- the entire time.', 'Or that she not teach it --', 'Yeah.', 'And what was really ironic about Catholic is that they actually used to have relatively good policies on freedom of association.  And they tried to start an NAACP chapter there, and Fire came in trying to -- defending the NAACP and holding them to their promises, and then they rescinded all those promises.  So it was one of the times where it actually ended up backfiring.', \"They can.  But if you really take this to its logical extreme, then they couldn't be universities because they literally couldn't talk about anything. Male Speaker: But --\", \"This evening, Kirsten and I have provided data and real examples demonstrating how liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus.  But you don't have to take it from us.  Just ask the professors themselves.  In a 2012 study, a representative sample of about 300 social psychologists were asked if two job candidates with equal qualifications were to apply for an opening in your department, and you knew one was politically conservative, would you be inclined to vote for the more liberal one?  82 percent of liberal social psychologists said they would at least be a little bit prejudice against the conservative applicant.  This is shocking, especially when you consider that social psychologists are so often concerned about the harm of unconscious bias.  It can be very hard to get respondents to concede that they might be prejudice.  Not -- not so apparently with conservatives and Christians. It's a well-known rule of social science that the more politically homogenous a group is, the more radical in that direction it tends to become and the more the group begins to act as a tribe that sees outsiders as enemies who are either stupid or simply bad or greedy.  Unfortunately, we're seeing this play out within our colleges and universities. Too many liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus and in doing so, they are encouraging people just to talk with those who they already agreed.  There are endless rules for collect speech -- correct speech are encouraging people to keep their opinions to themselves.  This only makes the tribalism problem worse and the walls of the echo chamber thicker.  It's not supposed to be this way, and it doesn't have to be this way. But the first step towards recovery is admitting you have a problem.  And on our campuses, we have a problem.  And I hope you will all recognize tonight that liberals sadly are stifling intellectual diversity.  Thank you.\"]\n",
      "[\"They do.  They call me up usually to tell me they saw me--you know, cheer me on for brawling with Bill O'Reilly.  And they always claim that they accidentally saw Fox News when they were flipping through the channels. [laughter]\", 'Thank you.  Thanks to Intelligence Squared for doing a debate on such an important topic.  And I\\'m always happy to be anywhere where Bill O\\'Reilly can\\'t interrupt me, so I\\'m happy to be here.  Our opponents are telling you that liberals are not stifling intellectual diversity on campuses.  Sadly, this could not be further from the truth.  A perfect example of this is a 2013 case that happened at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, where I\\'m from.  My parents were professors there.  A feminist professor filed multiple sexual harassment complaints against the student university -- the campus university there -- because of an April Fools Day issue of an article that was mildly mocking feminism.  The professor filed another complaint after the newspaper published an article that was critical of hate speech. The university\\'s repeated investigations dragged on for almost nine months and -- and it only really ended when FIRE had intervened and informed them they were violating the First Amendment.  Ironically, the editor-in-chief, who wrote this article, was herself a feminist and thought she was doing a very mild, mocking, April Fools Day story.  And she told FIRE that the chilling investigation that was launched by the University of Alaska prevented her from publishing stories on important issues, including sexual assault. Recently, at Milwaukee\\'s Marquette University, a political science professor there, John McAdams, blogged about an exchange where a Marquette philosophy professor had told a student that debating gay marriage in class was, quote, \"not appropriate and homophobic.\" For this, Marquette suspended the professor, McAdams, who blogged about it, banned him from campus, and they are now in the process of trying to revoke his tenure.  Greg and I both support gay marriage, but this is an extremely chilling way for Marquette to handle this issue.  As Jeremy acknowledged, the decks are stacked against those who express non-liberal views on campuses.  And I would just point out, to the point that campuses have always been liberal, liberals are very -- liberals -- the liberals in the past actually supported free speech, and I think that would be the big difference of today, is that the liberals that we\\'re talking about today are enacting very hostile policies against free speech.  And so there\\'s a big difference.  They may be voting for the same people, but they are behaving in a very different way.  And many studies will back up the fact that there are vastly more liberals on campuses.  There was one study that found that 72 percent of college professors identify as liberal, while only 15 percent identify as conservative. It\\'s gotten so bad that several prominent social psychologists have written an article recently arguing that the field of psychology is being badly hurt by the lack of political diversity.  One of the papers -- and, by the way, none of them are conservatives who social psychologist symposium, he asked the audience to show hands for their political leanings.  Out of a thousand people only three raised their hands to say that they were conservative.  And Haidt points out that, of course, there were more conservatives in the audience -- that can\\'t be the actual ratio -- but they were too afraid to identify themselves, which speaks for itself.  He explained that this gross political and ideological disparity is evidence of a, quote, \"tribal moral community that actively discourages conservatives from entering.\" He explained that there were -- in preparing for his speech, he wanted to talk to some non-liberal graduate students.  He was able to only identify two in the -- of social psychology graduate students, and that he said that he -- they reminded him of closeted gays from the 1980s.  And he referred to them as \"closeted conservatives\" because they were -- they felt that they were forced to hide their identities and -- from their colleagues and from their professors, and it really affected the research that they did. And so Haidt argued that more ideological diversity would lead to, quote, \"better science and freer thinking.\"  The ideological slant, it\\'s not just a passive preference. During the 2012 election, 96 percent, which is almost 100 percent as we all know, of political contributions from Ivy League faculty and staff went to the Obama campaign. And during the 2004 election, professors donated $19 to John Kerry\\'s campaign for every dollar that went to George Bush. And as sociologist Neil Gross has pointed out, our colleges and our universities are one- party campuses.  Last year at the University of California at Santa Barbara, one of the worst cases probably that we\\'ll talk about tonight, a feminist professor\\'s study -- she was found guilty of grand theft, vandalism, and battery after a physical altercation in which she stole and destroyed a 16-year-old pro-life demonstrator\\'s sign.  The professor claimed she was triggered by the poster\\'s graphic images, called the demonstrators \"terrorists,\" and told police she had a moral right to her behavior and was just setting a good example.  She still has a job and was basically defended by scores of professors. We\\'ve also seen discrimination against Christian groups on campuses  its getting much because they wanted to choose their own leaders based on religious belief. And there are just many more campus fellowship groups from University of -- State University of New York or the Cal State system who\\'ve lost -- have been driven off campus.  And, you know, Harvard Professor and former Obama administration appointee Cass Sunstein has warned that when a group becomes ideologically homogenous, it tends to drift farther and farther in that direction and become more hostile to outsiders.', \"But it's reason [inaudible].\", 'Yep.', 'Yeah.', \"The point isn't that it's always conservatives.  I don't -- that's not actually our position. The position is that it has overwhelmingly been used against conservatives, but liberals absolutely are affected by it as well, and that's a good example of it by liberals.  And, you know, what we're talking about is liberals stifling intellectual diversity.  And that kind of behavior is extremely chilling. So, if you're those students that you just described, and you're on a campus where you think you're going to get in trouble for a private conversation which we have a lot of -- you know the stories too.  There are a lot of stories like this.  You are going to be very careful about what you say.  And that is going to stifle intellectual diversity if people feel like I can't say something.  At Marquette University, there was another case where -- in their training of the professors, they had a slide that said to the professors -- it was an example of something that they might have to respond to.  Two students are talking. They oppose same-sex marriage.  They're talking about how they oppose same-sex marriage.  A third student overhears them and reports them to the administration. They were told this was the proper handling of this incident.  They're turning -- they're turning students into informants on each other for having a conversation.  And what even the conversation had become very heated and even they said things that were bigoted? I mean, people are supposed to, on campuses, be able to debate things and say offensive things.  And in that case, it's not even offensive.\", 'Are you saying administrators are conservative?', 'Yes.', \"Okay, but we're talking about big C and big L here, so, I mean, they're liberals.  I mean, the data overwhelmingly shows the --\", 'No.', \"No.  And no -- there is no role for speech codes.  And I think especially on a campus.  A campus is -- we hear a lot about how campuses are now supposed to be these safe spaces.  They should be physically safe.  But they should be places that you go and you feel challenged.  And you might feel angry, and you might feel upset, and you might read things and hear things that are -- that are intellectually diverse, and that you would actually encounter people who think differently than you.  And I think that a speech code just creates an extremely chilling environment -- especially because these speech codes are so arbitrary.  So, there -- it's left to the administrators to decide what violates the speech code.  And it's -- they're too -- they're overly broad. And they are sort of disproportionately used, I think, against --\", '-- people who are expressing so-called wrong views.', 'Civility to a point, but I think that that is overstressed, honestly.  I think that it should be robust debate in people.  It should be a place where students are allowed to make mistakes, you know, to say something that is offensive.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, I -- [laughter]', \"But that's not our argument.  We never argued it was just conservatives.\", 'And I should like to point out in --', \"I just -- I just -- I'm going to reiterate again that it is not our argument that it is only conservatives or even that it's -- that it's necessarily an ideological crusade, though it often is. The point is intellectual diversity is being -- is being stifled and that -- and it does -- and when you -- when you do it to a liberal or whether you do it to a conservative or do it to an agnostic, it creates a culture of fear and makes it impossible for people to speak openly.\", 'No.', \"Right.  I think -- I mean, we haven't talked about a lot of cases where it actually doesn't have anything to do with the administrators.  It has the -- the Kaminer, that was derived completely from students.  In fact, the administrator that the president of Smith was there when it happened and -- and it really wasn't that much of an incident.  It was something that came from students, and students who then started protesting and demanding, you know, that the president of Smith condemn this and all these other things.  So, I think you see it with Bill Maher, same thing. You know, it was a student-led revolt against him for his comments about Islam.  These were, again, from the left.  But it all has the same effect of making people feel that they can't -- they cannot say how they think because they don't know what kind of retribution [unintelligible].\", '[unintelligible] called a racist [unintelligible].', \"You even mis-rep -- you've done exactly what they did.

Now, would I have done what she did?  No, I don't think so.  It was provocative.  But for her to be tarred as a racist the way that she was and accused of making racist comments when you know perfectly well --\", \"-- she did not say something racist.

She was saying -- she was talking specifically about how they are trying to censor certain works of literature on campuses because of words that are offensive to people.  And she was making the point that this is not something we should do. Male Speaker: Huckleberry Finn Kirsten Powers: Yeah, Huck Finn specifically.  And then to have her now portray it as like the -- you know, like Bull Connor. You know what I mean?  It's not -- that people know what happened --\", \"Yeah.  I -- well, I mean, this reminds me a little of Eric Posner, who is a University of Chicago law professor, just wrote an article for Slate Magazine basically arguing that -- in defense of a lot of these different -- of speech codes in particular, and he didn't -- I don't know if he mentioned trigger warnings because he said that what people don't understand is that students today are really our children and that they need to be protected.  And that's sort of what is behind this idea -- which, to me, doesn't seem like something that's really encouraging a robust sort of intellectual debate. But look, if you want to do trigger warnings, you can do trigger warnings.  The problem that has been raised has been with professors who have been told that they must provide trigger warnings.  So, at Oberlin, for example, a lot of professors revolted.  And the -- University of California, Santa Barbara, there -- the students were demanding them.  And I think that that is a very different thing, especially because, if you look at the list of the things that could potentially trigger something -- students, at Oberlin, they said it could literally be anything.  And so, how that -- you know, how does that not chill a professor --\", \"-- of living in fear that they're going to trigger anybody?\", 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.

And she says specifically that this is, you know, perpetrated by left-wing groups who are advising the students, to tell them that they shouldn't have to sit in a rape law class if it's upsetting to them, to the point that she said, surveying various professors across the country, that they are now giving up teaching rape law because of the fear --\", '-- of the backlash from --', '-- the students.', 'If you\\'re part of the dominant culture, which, on university campuses -- as we\\'ve established -- is primarily liberal -- it\\'s easy to mistake your beliefs for objective truth. It\\'s also easy to imagine there are no reasonable or intelligent people who think differently on important topics, because you\\'re not encountering them.  I know this because I\\'ve lived most of my life in the liberal bubble.  There were two experiences that took me out of this.  One was becoming a contributor at Fox News.  And the other was a later in life conversion to Christianity.  I can remember actually saying to somebody that I was debating at Fox that Harriet Miers -- who George Bush was -- had nominated for the Supreme Court -- didn\\'t count as a female appointment, because she was a conservative and an evangelical Christian. I\\'m embarrassed, frankly, that I ever thought that.  It was a prejudiced view, and unfortunately, I wasn\\'t alone in my prejudice.  A 2007 study of faculty on college campuses found that 53 percent had cool or negative feelings towards evangelical Christians.  These levels of disapproval raise curious questions about how evangelical students are treated on campus.  The only way that one could believe that liberals aren\\'t stifling intellectual diversity on campuses is if they never visit FIRE\\'s website and if they don\\'t have any friendships with non-liberals.  At a dinner party a couple weeks ago, I met a retired Stanford professor and a Harvard Law School student -- both evangelicals - - who described to me how they felt they had to hide their beliefs, lest they be ostracized or punished. A third person, who was a former professor at a DC area university, was passed over for a position because she was suspected -- correctly -- of being a conservative.  And this was in writing.  These stories are all too familiar.  I hear them regularly, but people are too afraid to speak publicly.  They don\\'t want to lose their jobs or academic careers, and FIRE receives calls from people like this nearly every single day.  I believe you must vote \"YES\" on this motion tonight: Liberals Are Stifling Intellectual Diversity On Campuses.']\n",

      "['Josef Joffe:', 'Peter Zeihan:']\n",
      "[\"Absolutely.  First of all, because it was a hot shower every day, which I wasn't used to in Berlin.  Second, root beer floats. [laughter] Josef Joffe: Fifteen cent hamburgers and 28 flavors of Baskin Robbins.\", \"Well, don't you know his name? [laughter]\", \"I don't know how to pronounce it.  Peter, that's easy.\", 'Ziehan or Zeihan?', 'America as a has-been is the oldest story in the book.  Even right after the Revolution, the famous American -- French statesman Talleyrand dumped on the United States by saying it\\'s a country with 30 religions and just one dish to eat. [laughter] Josef Joffe: Little did he know that a bit later, like today, that one dish would blanket the world with 35,000 McDonalds. [laughter] Josef Joffe: Decline is not a real serious diagnosis.  It\\'s repertoire theater.  Today, we are in decline 5.0.  We\\'ve had four before.  And various candidates -- Russia, Europe, Japan -- were about to overtake the United States, leave the United States in the dust, and now it is the Soviet -- it is China.  These prophecies did not pan out because they confused the headlines with the long-term trend.  Exhibit A for every declinist is the economy, where others are always said to be growing faster.  But here\\'s the surprise. For the last 50 years, the U.S.  share of the global GDP has held steady, around 25, 26 percent.  In the same period, the E.U.  lost 11 points, Japan more than two.  And Russia has cut its share in half.  So, who\\'s declining, if I may ask?  Let\\'s put it this way.  If Rome, starting some 2000 years ago, had been declining at America\\'s rate, we would be debating in Latin today. [laughter] Josef Joffe: Now, a certain measure of power is military spending.  The U.S.  is in a league of its own. It spends almost four times more than China, seven times more than Russia, 12 times more than Japan.  It spends as much as the next nine countries together, five of whom, by the way, are allies.  What does all this cash buy?  The short answer is that the U.S. navy is as large as the next 12 navies together. In its heyday, Britain only wanted to be twice as strong as the next one.  So, only the United States can intervene anywhere in the world, nobody else can.  Like those B-2 stealth bombers that took off in Missouri, dropped a load on Libya, and returned home in one trip.  Now, that\\'s a snapshot, our opponents will say -- will say.  The others will inevitably overtake the United States, because they\\'re growing -- they\\'re rising.  Do you mean Russia, with an economy that\\'s one-tenth the size of America?  Or China, which has a per capita one-eighth of America?  China -- China, you will say, \"Look, they came from nowhere.  They\\'re now number 2.\" But the days of China\\'s spectacular growth are over.  It\\'s one half of what it once was.  And this is no accident -- the Chinese growth model is like Japan\\'s, and Taiwan\\'s, and South Korea -- all of them have come down. The -- and so, there is something inherently wrong with this model.  We\\'ll talk about it later.  So, the -- the -- they would say, \"But what about the Chinese labor force?\" Well, the Chinese advantage is gone, too.  Productivity has not kept up with the explosion of wages.  In manufacturing, the wage gap with the U.S.  has almost disappeared.  And worse, this year, the Chinese labor supply will begin to shrink due to rapid aging.  The U.S., on the other hand, will be the youngest nation in the industrialized world.  Let\\'s think about future.  What drives growth in the future?  Well, factor number one is higher education.  Did you know that of the top 20 universities, 17 are American?  The first Chinese university shows up in the 100 to 150 bracket.  You look at -- you look at citations in scientific journals. You look at patents.  The gap between the U.S.  and China is just as wide as the Pacific. So and but the greatest -- the greatest American advantage is the power of immigration. China and Russia, closed societies, don\\'t even think about immigration.  But here, as you know, from the very beginning the tide continues to flow in.  Why do I harp on immigration?  Because it keeps the country not only young but also from freezing up. Immigration breaks privilege and fuels competition.  There\\'s always another group that pushes in, works harder, and rises to the top.  The newcomers keep bringing ambition and skill as they have done for the -- for 300 years.  Try to become a Chinese.  I want to become a Chinese.  It\\'s easy to become an American.  Here, I\\'ll tell you how to do it.  I celebrate 4th of July and Thanksgiving.  I joined the PTA and coach Little League. [laughter] Josef Joffe: I stopped smoking.  I buy an SUV and shop till I drop. [laughter] Josef Joffe: The serious point is anybody can sign up to the American creed.  And, \"Where did you go to school?\" beats, \"Where do you come from?\" any time.  As a Chechnyan you\\'ll never become a real Russian, but Sergey Brin could come here from Russia and start Google.  Did you know that one half of Silicon Valley\\'s engineers were born abroad? Two-fifths of all startups in the Valley built two years ago were founded by immigrants, Vladivostok or Kyoto or even Madrid.  Immigration is the inexhaustible source of rejuvenation, bringing in the world\\'s best and brightest.  That\\'s the moral of this tale. Let me ask -- end with a surprise confession.  I actually like this American obsession with decline.  Its part of the country\\'s religion of self-improvement -- [laughter] Josef Joffe: -- an offshoot of the prophetic tradition. Isaiah: Beware of sloth, pride.  Look at your own flaws, and keep on hustling.  Declinism is the best antidote to decline.  But declinism is repertoire theater, like a good scare, like another sequel to \"Nightmare on Elm Street.\" Where are Soviet Russia, Europe, Japan today?  Where is 15 percent growth of China?  The truth is, only one nation can do an America, and that is America itself.  And that\\'s why I like this declinist agitation.  It will make sure it won\\'t happen.  So, to repeat from -- I\\'ve been going downhill at the American rate, we would be debating in Latin today, like Gratias [unintelligible], which means, \"Thank you, and see you in the next round.\" [laughter]', 'Well, we heard this number about the -- declining middle class for a long time. I don\\'t think it has anything to do with the issue whether the country itself is declining, but let\\'s go with the issue of equality.  The way to measure inequality is not by anecdote, but by something called the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality around the world.  And lo and behold, you\\'ll be surprised.  Once you take into account taxes and transfers, the United States has a Gini coefficient of 0.37.  Total inequality will be one.  Zero will be no inequality.  The great state of Canada has a genie coefficient of 0.34.  The great state of Germany, the model of the wealthiest state, 0.35.  Italy almost 0.4.  So, if you want to talk inequality, talk the right numbers. Do not talk anecdotes and repeat what you read every other day in \"The New York Times.\"', \"You cant argue both sides.  Either you talk inequality or [unintelligible].  If inequality comes down by government action, isn't that what the welfare state is all about?\", '[unintelligible]', 'Let me respond?', \"I think that the issue of equality is an interesting moral issue, but it has nothing to do with what we're debating about today.  We are talking about whether the United States is declining or not relative to other nations.  We are not talking about where the United States was 50 or 100 years ago.  It was a hell of a lot more unequal in those days.  We are talking about by the measures that we normally use to measure power, economy, military, education, research and development spending, scientific achievements. Those are the measures as opposed to anecdotes that measure up or down.\", 'Turkey has more --', \"-- journalists in jail than any other country in the world that I know of.  Let me just say something about decline.  I think decline is a relative issue.  It's not an absolute issue.  I am taller or fatter, or thinner than you are.  Just to say that I'm taller, or fatter, or thinner is not a very interesting issue unless I compare myself to others.\", 'We have none in prison.', \"[unintelligible], relative decline. [laughter] Josef Joffe: And relative decline, by the way -- let me tell you -- of course the United States had 50 percent of GDP and 45.  The rest of the world was destroyed.  The point is, its share has held steady for the last 50 years.  But let me get away from this.  Let me talk about gridlock, about the inability, you know, the inability to govern.  Do you know what gridlock looked like in the days of Jefferson, when they used to shoot each other? [laughter] Josef Joffe: Okay.  That was just a debating point.  Let me say something about how, in spite of this so-called gridlock and ungovernability, how this country got out of the great recession? It flooded the country with liquidity. It went into heavy deficit and it recapitalized the banks, this gridlocked country, that totally polarized country, as a result of which this country is now growing at 3 to 4 percent.  What about the Europeans?  I'm sorry to compare the United States to other countries, but where are they in terms of growth now?  They've tried something.  It doesn't work.  Do you know with the banking system in China, you just hold a little match to it and it will explode like a nuclear weapon.\", \"What's going bankrupt?  Just tell me again, whos going bankrupt? [talking simultaneously]\", 'Did you pay your way at Harvard?', 'Aha. [laughter]', 'Let me give you a number -- [applause] Josef Joffe: -- 60 --', '-- 60 percent of the so-called elite universities, 60 percent of those students are getting scholarships in one way or another.  This is probably the best ladder of advancement you can get is the so-called \"American elite universities.\"  When I look at these kids in my seminar at Stanford, and I blame them for not knowing American history and then they all look up, and I see Korea, China, India, and so on, so that is one thing.  One other point, the next -- once people concede the best universities in the world, they say, \"Yes, but what about secondary education?\" Again, one has to look at the numbers.  Most Americans don\\'t know it, but there\\'s an OECD -- regular OECD study called PISA, Program of International Student Assessment. And, lo and behold, that maligned American high school, when it comes to reading and math skills, these kids are pretty much in the middle of the Italians, French, Israelis are far down, and Germans.  So, that American state school system, which has been maligned for the last hundred years, is delivering pretty good stuff, at least it is not as everybody thinks, at the rock bottom.', \"Let me again try to bring this back to the issue of the debate.  You can't prove the point about decline versus non-decline by anecdotes.  Now let's take the so-called withdrawal of the United States from the global arena, which by the way, is not exactly a liberal kind of critique, but more from the right, but it's true that under Obama this country has withdrawn, whether it's Minsk or Brussels or Pinsk or whatever. Do you guys know where Pinsk is?  No. [laughter] Josef Joffe: I do.\", \"So -- wait, wait, wait, wait. [laughter] [applause] Josef Joffe: Now the problem is here with these arguments is that we can or you can vote Obama out of power in two years and this may change.  The kind of long-term forces we keep talking about that Europe suffers under, China suffers under, Japan, you name it, cannot be decided or changed by vote and that's why I plead with you to keep anecdotes and trends apart.\", 'No .', \"No, it's not.  It's not because --\", \"No, I'm sorry.  To explain Hitler's rise you have to go into heavy duty sociology and economics and history. Anecdotes prove nothing.  They just make good debating points.\", \"I'm talking about friends and forces.\", \"Well, if I may say.  If I'm allowed to repeat myself, some of the points I made have nothing to do with economic might.  The power of immigration I'm talking about has nothing to do with it.  The fact, what does it mean for somebody like Sergey Bryn to start Google?  It means the freedom to dream, invent, and invest.  It means rule of law. It means property rights.  It means no barriers to competition.  That's why this Russian- born kid did Google here and not in St.  Petersburg.\", \"No. [laughter] [applause] Josef Joffe: No.  The anecdote made a very important point.

[laughter]', \"Look, you want disgrace, you can have disgrace. [applause] Josef Joffe: But you can have the disgrace.  I mean, the -- some of the numbers that you mentioned are right.  The homicide -- by the way, homicide in this country has gone done enormously since the '90s, but that won't convince -- the infant mortality, high, we can explain it, but that's not the point.  The point is what kind of standards are you setting here?\", \"No, I don't -- I --\", \"You're taking sides.  I'm sorry you're taking sides.\", 'I was going [spelled phonetically] to talk about it, but you interrupted me. [laughter]', 'And you keep interrupting us.  Anyway --', '-- I can set any kind of standard which no country, no person can live up to.  Does the United States have flaws?  Of course it has flaws.  It had tons of flaws.  But it has nothing to do -- this is not an issue -- this is a moral issue which this country must fight and wrestle with but has nothing to do with the issue of decline or not decline.  This is moral failure but not a power failure and we are talking about decline -- is about power and not about going to church.', 'Can we --', \"-- can we compare the United States with the United States?  I mean, when we talk about moral turpitude or failure, what -- how would we rate what followed the crime of slavery in the '60s when I was in college when we took over city hall for civil rights issues and stuff like that?  Hasn't this country done a hell of a good job in -- with the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, bringing previously downtrodden and discriminated people up to turn them into real citizens?  Is that not the kind of moral achievement or what is this?  If we think in terms of inequality, which is to obtain in this country when there was a Anglo WASP overclass ruling over others, and now one group after another being emancipated and made full citizens, is that moral failure or what is that?\", 'Okay, a lot of our debate reminds me of the story about Socrates being asked, \"Socrates, how is your wife?\"  And he says, \"Compared to what?\" [laughter] Josef Joffe: And let me repeat this again.  Remember, you talk about decline?  We are talking about comparison.  And we are talking also, if you wish, about progress, how we compare America then with America now.  And -- but the most important thing is, \"Is there somebody --\" as we have argued in this country from decline 1.0 to decline -- \"Is there somebody who was better, more agile, more virile, more ambitious, more skillful? And will that nation overtake the United States?\"  And as I tried to make the point I was trying to make is that these challenges, we thought, we\\'re growing faster, we\\'re doing better, have all fallen by the wayside, which, therefore, then, made me look at the inherent and not the anecdotal sources of strength of this country.  And if you look at the economy, the way this economy has rebounded while no other economy after the crash has rebounded, you must kind of say, there must be something here, or, we can explain it.  Why the country does better in those respects, if you look at the relative decline of Japan, Europe, the United States in terms of global GDP, that gives you a sense that, again, transcends individual stories and tells you something about trends. And that\\'s why I think the decline is a good pedagogical device. And if you\\'ll notice, half the time we spoke about how America should get better, which is a very good thing to talk about, but the issue is whether this country is declining vis a vis others and there you have no data whatsoever that makes the point.  In fact, the opposite is true.', 'George is okay.  George is okay.']\n",
      "['Zeihan on Geopolitics.', 'Better lucky than good. [laughter]', \"I considered declining this invitation when it was made.  NPR intellectual is not really my crowd.  I live in Texas.  But then I realized that the word damn was in the proposition so I'd be allowed to swear. On NPR. A lot. [laughter]\", \"Oh, it's like a third of the total, but we've got a lot of youngsters up top.  So, you know, it's a swarm.  Most of your consumption, however, is behind you.  Your kids have left home.  The house is paid for.  You're at the height of your tax-paying experience, which means that the government's like, I'll take some of that, and then I'll take some more. Today's budget battles, that's the start of our debate about figuring out not how to pay things with your money, but about how to pay your retirement without your money. Something to look forward to.  Which sucks for this next group.  Where are my Gen-Y? Or excuse me, Gen-X.  Gen-X.  Oh, we're all here.  Yeah, we're the smallest generation as a percentage of the population.  So very soon it will be up to us, all 11 of us, -- [laughter] Peter Zeihan: -- to pay for 75 million retiring boomers.  Taxes are going to be awful, but it's not quite as bad as it seems.  Because while the boomers are so convinced that they're so special, there's actually a boomer class globally that relative to the population is about 20 percent larger than it is here.  So, yes we do have a boomer donculous [spelled phonetically] tax bill just around the corner, but it's actually considerably less than what everyone else is going to have to pay. So, you know, not exactly hope, but you know, schadenfreude.  And then there's Gen-Y. Gen-Y folks, you know, the millennials.  Oh, a few of you showed up tonight.  That's great.  Your age group does the consuming.  Kids, houses, cars, pot.  It's -- [laughter] Peter Zeihan: -- spend, spend, spend.  Your purchases, especially the pot, by the way, are why the economy is doing so well right now.  Because of you, because of your bulk, the United States is going to be the youngest developing -- excuse me, developed country in the world in just four years, younger than China.  And in 15 years when you have matured, and I use that term in the loosest possible way -- [laughter] Peter Zeihan: -- you will swarm into the taxpaying class with a fervor that Gen X just could've never matched.  And Gen X will be settling into the tardis-like space that the boomers will be vacating and America's 20-year effort to digest the boomer demography will finally be over.  Now, as an X-er it really pains me to say this, but you Gen-Y-ers are special. [laughter] Peter Zeihan: Because there are no German Y's or Japanese Y's or Italian or Canadian Y's.  It's as if the entire developed world forgot how to have kids around 1975 and I think we've all traveled enough to know they got the basics down. [laughter] Peter Zeihan: This combination of bigger global Boomer cadre, but no global Y cadre spells disaster. Consumer activity and tax income will shrink every single year.  Retiree costs will increase every single year.  It's a deflationary spiral with no escape and it will happen everywhere but the United States.  And that's the good news.  Let's talk about the bad news.  Let's talk about trade.  The idea that you can trade with a country a quarter, a third, halfway around the world, that's a very strange idea. Until recently, major countries used their navies to protect trade between their colonies and their mainland.  You didn't trade with your neighbor if you could avoid it, because you never knew when someone might throw a war, and you lose access to everything. These separate imperial systems clashed, and those clashes culminated in World War II. Now, at the end of that war, the United States forced all of its allies to sit down, and we imposed a new economic system upon the world.  We called it free trade.  We told them they didn't need navies.  We would patrol the global oceans and allow them to send whatever they wanted anywhere to anyone at anytime.  In addition, we would open our market -- the only consumer market survived the war -- so, they could export their ways back to affluence.  In exchange, there was one demand.  This alliance would fight the Cold War our way.  You heard that right.  We bribed up an alliance to take on the Soviets.  And it worked.  Free trade created the free world.  Europe united.  Japan rebuilt.  China modernized. The global population tripled.  Global GDP increased by a factor of 10.  One-third of the Chinese and Italian GDP -- export-driven.  The EU?  The Chinese Communist Party?  All of that would have been impossible without the safe and reliable access to the global oceans and the U.S.  market.  Which leads us to the world's most inconvenient truth -- the United States didn't create free trade as an economic plan, but as a strategic gambit. We don't use free trade's economic features.  Our exports -- 9 percent of GDP, the lowest in the world by a significant margin.  We are the least integrated country out there.  America's economy, and future, are not dependent upon the global system.  It's the global system that is predicated upon America's willingness to sublimate its market and its military in order to fight a war that ended a generation ago.  That is not a safe bet.  I mean, really, have you met Americans?  We kind of shoot from the hip. The world is now dependent upon our mood.  And even should we stick to our Prozac regimen, the majority of the world's Boomers will still retire around 2020, which just as surely will trigger a Great Depression, if we're lucky.  There are many other reasons, similarly inevitable, why the U.S.  will remain the global superpower well beyond our lifetimes.  The shale revolution has pushed North America within 2 million barrels per day of outright oil independence.  And we now have the lowest electricity prices, non- subsidized -- in the world.  The U.S.  is home to nearly half of global consumer spending, double that of the combined BRICs.  The Navy has a 10:1 ratio, conservatively, in terms of global firepower.  And the commitment of that imbalance to the global commons is why trade works.  And the dollar is the sole denomination for every commodity in every country, especially for those export-driven rivals who are utterly dependent upon free seas and open markets. So, when you think of the U.S., it doesn't matter if you feel a swelling pride, a loathing, or a resigned sigh.  Your conclusion is as singular as it is clear.  Bet on America. Declinists be damned.\", \"Well, actually, the data doesn't support that.

I'm sorry, but how much better than the top slot in absolute relative term do you have to be to win this debate? [laughter] Peter Zeihan: The Euro is dissolving as a global currency.  Three trillion dollars has flooded the United States in the last five years.  Skilled migration is at all time highs.  By every measure that matters the United States has not fallen behind.  It's pulling ahead.  And that assumes that we keep maintaining a trade system that hasn't benefited us for 30 years.  God forbid we have a bad hair day.\", \"Let's talk about America's past.

John Adams was accused of being a hermaphrodite with any of the positive characteristics -- whatever the hell that means. [laughter] Peter Zeihan: Gen Y doesn't have opportunities?  Let's take it from the economic side.  Look back to the 1800s.  We had an empty continent that anyone for the price of a KIA car could load up the family, head west, take land that we stole from the natives, and be exporting grain for hard currency to war-torn Europe within six months. That will never happen again.  Because there's not another continent.

      "['Well, I hope they find me entertaining. [laughter]', 'My partner is the wonderful, the drop-dead sexy editor at Vox, Matthew Yglesias.', 'Wow, I am so happy to be here, and I\\'m glad you\\'re all seated after listening to Scott\\'s monologue because he just proved that Amazon is engaging in nefarious acts of capitalism. [laughter] Joe Konrath: I\\'m smiling right now -- seriously, what the heck am I doing on this panel?  We\\'ve got two journalists on this panel.  We\\'ve got a lawyer on this panel.  We\\'ve got a lawyer on this panel who did what all the lawyers wish they could do.  He actually saved an innocent man from death row.  He did. [applause] Joe Konrath: Okay.  That\\'s enough.  His head is big enough.  Innocent man from death row.  These guys went to Harvard.  They went to Stanford. They went to Columbia University.  I went to Columbia College. [laughter] Joe Konrath: It is not affiliated.  I majored in Budweiser.  And you think oh, that\\'s a blow off major, but I still only got a 2.2 GPA. [laughter] Joe Konrath: You know what, that may have been a 2.2 blood alcohol level. [laughter] Joe Konrath: I couldn\\'t remember the finals at all.  I\\'m telling you.  But I am very happy to be up here and I\\'m going to keep smiling because I really can\\'t believe that I am here.  Who\\'s seen the movie \"The Paper Chase\"?  It\\'s about a Harvard law student working his butt off, taking classes, studying to actually become a big lawyer, and Scott actually did that.  And when I went to school I was in my dorm making a sofa out of empty beer cans. [laughter] Joe Konrath: So why am I here?  I don\\'t know why I\\'m here. Okay, I\\'ve sold some books.  Okay, I like Amazon.  By a show of hands, how many people here have bought something from Amazon?  Okay.', \"That is everybody in the room.  By a show of hands, how many people hate raising their hands? [laughter] Joe Konrath: That's meta.  You're going to laugh about that later.  Let's get on topic here.  Scott brought up publishers.  Amazon is the big bad guy, but what about these publishers? Well, you know what?  Publishers are the bad guy and I'm going to tell you why.  He said earlier we need publishers for culture, for rich literary culture.  That's incorrect. Publishers don't write books.  Authors write the books.  Authors are the ones who impart this rich literary culture.  The publishers are just high-priced middle men, okay? Let's talk about publishers and all of the books they have rejected. Publishers reject hundreds of books for everyone that they publish.  Now think about that.  That's censorship.  It really is.  There are thousands of books out there that you have never seen because the guardians of culture, those publishers, have never published them.  Nine of them were mine. [laughter] Joe Konrath: I got more than 500 rejections.  Yeah, I know, every time the mailman came I had to pop a Prozac. [laughter] Joe Konrath: I eventually did get published after my 10th book and then I learned more about publishers.  I learned that publishers charge too much.  Scott's new book, which I'm sure is excellent, the publisher nicely printed the price right on the cover, $28.00 for a hardcover.  Wow, 28 bucks.  If you can't afford that and you're a huge Turow fan you can wait a year and get the cheaper priced paperback. That's called windowing.  That doesn't seem like publishers are really friends to readers. They would give them that paperback earlier because the paperback vastly outsells the hardcover.   Publishers give out advances.  They give an author an advance.  Now, I got a nice advance according to Publisher's Weekly, $30,000 bucks and I was pleased to get it and I felt I was really lucky because the average advance is $5,000.  You're not going to live off $5,000, especially since publishers pay you that over the course of three years. In small payments twice a year, because publishers only pay twice a year.  It -- a word on advances before I get off that topic, an advance has to be paid back in copies sold, okay? And it's a very high interest loan. If I self-publish on Amazon, which I have done successfully many times, in fact since I started self-publishing on Amazon, my income went up 20 percent.  Oh no wait.  That's wrong.  It went up 20 times. [laughter] Joe Konrath: So it went up 2,000 percent.  My best year traditionally published I made 50 grand.  Last year I made a million dollars.  That's still 50 grand after taxes. [laughter] Joe Konrath: What it comes down to is publishers are deciding what you read and what you won't read.  They decide how you get it and how much you pay for it and they have that much power because they are a cartel.  They are a form of monopoly called an oligopoly.  The top five publishers control 80 percent of all the print books.  As a writer, if I want to get into a bookstore, I have to go through those publishers.  And they don't have to pay me anything, because there are 10 guys behind me who want my spot. Amazon looked at this market and they decided publishers weren't reader's friends.  So, they innovated.  They opened the world's biggest bookstore with the best customer service.  They invented the e-book reader that everybody wants, along with the app that everybody wants.  They gave all authors a chance to reach readers.  So, my nine books that sat on a shelf finally got out there and reached readers.  And I guess readers like them, because I sold a million of them. [laughter] Joe Konrath: In other words, Amazon looked at all the things publishers were doing wrong and then they did them right.  And rather than try to compete, the publishers colluded and price- fixed to raise prices.  We'll talk more about that a little later.  This debate is not about Amazon being the writer's friend, though.  I can give you examples that they are, but that's not what this is about.  It's not about Amazon being the publisher's friend.  That's not this debate. It's not about Amazon being a monopoly.  That's not the debate.  It is about Amazon being the reader's friend.  Amazon isn't perfect.  No person is.  No company is.  But let me tell you something.  If Amazon right now were building a death machine that was fueled by the screams of puppies -- [laughter] -- it still wouldn't matter because they're still a friend to readers.  Thank you.\", 'Well, when did it become necessary for a company to buoy up its competition?  I mean, aren\\'t companies supposed to try to beat the competition?  Isn\\'t that the point?  Can you imagine the CEO of Coca-Cola calling his board meeting, \"Well, we\\'re really kicking Pepsi\\'s butt.  And, you know, we want to foster competition, so what we\\'re going to do is we are going to send out teams --\"', '\"-- to beat up everybody who is drinking a Coca-Cola.\"', 'And what company does not try to compete and gain as much market share as possible?', \"A gazelle to everybody who votes for us.  Okay.  Talking about your last question monopolies versus the oligopoly and why am I against the oligopoly.  The oligopoly wants less choice and higher prices.  The monopoly wants more choices and really low prices and what is the topic of this debate?  Is Amazon the friend to readers?  Well, what do you want?  Higher prices?  Less choices?  Lower prices?  More choices?  It's pretty simple.\", \"No, they're made by authors, Scott.\", \"And that bothers you because you've made a lot of money with these publishers, and I understand that.\", 'Okay, well, you know what?  I\\'ve listened to you guys and I\\'m going to back off on my stance for a little bit.  You made a point.  Advances for works of nonfiction that take a long time, we should support these, and publishers have in the past supported these, but you\\'re conflating two things here, Scott.  It\\'s a fallacy.  Just because that\\'s the way things were always done doesn\\'t mean it\\'s the way it should be done forever.  Franklin said something great.  Only one thing, but he said something great.  He said, \"You know what advances are like?\" Advances are like Kickstarter for authors. You know what\\'s great about that?  You know what\\'s better than an advance that takes 52.5 percent of your money?  How about Kickstarter. [laughter]', \"You -- you are not comparing equals.  It's --\", '[unintelligible], I have choice.', \"Okay.  We don't need publishers.  They are middle men.  They were once essential because they were the only way you could get your book into bookstores.  They were the only way to connect an author and a reader. Now we do not need them.  We can reach readers -- and I can reach more readers through Amazon than I could with the 10-something publishers, all of which were big publishers, that I worked for.  And it's not equal.  It's not like you can choose to self- publish or legacy publish, because legacy publish -- [bell rings] Joe Konrath: -- makes you jump through \", \"Well, okay.  I am less worried about the tiger that's going to eat me next month, and I'm more concerned about the lion that is chewing on my leg right now.  The lion chewing on my leg is Legacy Publishing.\", 'And the devil is good, Scott.  The devil is good in bed. [laughter]', 'Scott, I don\\'t have a contract with Amazon.  I can leave Amazon whenever I want to. You have a contract with Hachette.  You once called Amazon the \"Darth Vader of the publishing industry.\"  Why are your books still on Amazon?  You\\'re like profiting from selling the evil empire [inaudible].', \"Oh, is that it?  So, you can take a strong stance against something, but then profit off of it?  What's that word? [laughter] Joe Konrath: What's the word for that?\", 'No.', \"What -- I know what you're -- That's not what I said.  You're misquoting me or you misread me or you misunderstood me.  I don't make any decisions unless I have information.  They introduced -- Amazon introduced something called Kindle Unlimited.  For $10 a month, you can get unlimited books, read as many as you want to. Male Speaker: Sounds terrible for readers. Joe Konrath: I know, that sounds terrible for -- it does sound terrible for readers, doesn't it?  My books were in that program.  I now have data of what it's like to be in that program. Now I am going to take them out of that program because I control my books, and I am going to check to see how the data aligns.  And if I don't like it, I will leave.\", 'As opposed to you who has no power over where your books are put?', 'I love editors, and I have several editors, and they\\'re easy to find. There\\'s a whole group in this country called, \"freelancers,\" and they actually will do editing for a set fee, and that set fee is nice.  It\\'s some cost.  It\\'s not you paying forever. When you are edited by one of the big five, they own that book for your lifetime plus 70 years.  That editor who spent two weeks on a book that it took you two years to write gets paid for that long.  I\\'d rather pay a freelancer some costs and then keep the money from that point on.', 'Well, everything is of value, but value also has a cost and the cost for a legacy editor is, in my opinion, too high.  In some instances it may not be too high.  I had a great publisher at Hyperion for my first six books.  Her name was Leslie Wells.  She was great. And now she was fired so I can hire Leslie Wells whenever I want to and she just appeared on my blog talking about her new book, which she self-published.', \"No, she's going to get an editor.\", \"I've got a friend named Hugh Howey whose sales just completely blow mine away and Hugh and an unnamed data guy who I happen to know who really knows his stuff, started a website called authorearnings.com. And what they're showing is, yeah, the pie is growing.  Traditional publishers don't see the pie growing.  Their part of the pie is staying the same.  But for the rest of us, the pie is getting bigger.\", 'The data is there, Scott.  You can check it.  Anybody can check it.  He -- they list everything and their math is solid.', \"They take screenshots of Amazon.  That's where they're coming from.\", \"They're not picking anything.  They're just allowing anybody who has an idea to have the opportunity --\", '-- to reach --', \"Well, it's their company.

It's not going to [unintelligible] - -\", \"-- it's their choice.\", 'Well, hypothetically, I think a lot of bad things can happen.  But I don\\'t see that happening right now. I talk with Amazon about changing algorithms.  I haven\\'t heard anybody admit that, \"Yeah, we\\'re futzing with this and we\\'re futzing with that.\" Now, they\\'re notoriously tight-lipped about anything.  What are they going to tell me for?  But how do we automatically jump to, \"Wait a second.  Amazon is doing something shifty here.\"', \"You think Amazon invented that?  That's called co-op. That's why, when you go into a Barnes & Noble, you see 400 Scott Turow books --\", '-- stacked up in front -- [laughter]', 'And you see my one book out in section.', \"When are we talking these sales?  In the past?  Maybe 70 percent.  Recently, 95 percent. Now I'm scaling back on Amazon, because I'm going to test some things out with some other platforms, see what they're doing.  It changes.  It fluctuates.  The industry is in flux right now.\", \"I'm not on the other websites. [applause]\", 'No.', \"[laughs] I have one fan.  Thank you. [laughter] Joe Konrath: I have three minutes or two minutes?  Okay.  Two minutes.  You know, I'm thinking can I finish in two minutes and I know my wife is watching this and she's like you always finish in two minutes. [laughter] Joe Konrath: I'm not going to -- hey, hey, you're wasting my time.  I'm not going to sum up everything.  I'm not going to use any more -- I'm not going to introduce any new data. I'm not going to introduce any new facts.  I'm not going to try to sway over on the logic here, I'm going to say this one thing.  I will bribe you if you change your vote to Amazon is a friend to readers.  This is how I'm going to bribe you.  I'm going to give you all of my e-books for free and because I know Scott is such a fan of piracy I'm also going to give you all of his e-books. [laughter] Joe Konrath: For free.  Actually, of course, I'm kidding, but underneath that, I'm kind of not kidding.  I have the ability to with Amazon give away my books, put them on sale, lower the price, make them free.  I've sold millions of books.  I've given away millions of books.  Amazon allows me to do that.  Tell me that's not being a friend to a reader and remember please vote Amazon is the reader's friend.  Thank you.\"]\n",
      "[\"Well, my father happens to be here live, so I'd like to think he's voting strategically and sort of rigging the grade in my favor.\", 'Amazon is the reader\\'s friend.  In the long-term obviously readers are only going to thrive in a world where author\\'s also thrive and I suspect we\\'re going to spend a lot of time eventually talking about the impact, the long-run impact of Amazon on authors and authorship.  And my partner is going to be able to speak to a lot of that in a great deal of detail, more depth than I possibly can.  But I write about economics.  I\\'m a pretty literal person.  So, Im going to keep it a little bit on the surface level -- Amazon is the Reader\\'s Friend.  And I think you can see that Amazon is the reader\\'s friend, by just asking, why are we debating this at all?  Why is this a subject of controversy?  It\\'s a subject of controversy because Amazon is really big. It\\'s a big company.  It\\'s a powerful company.  They have 41 percent of all books sold -- I saw a statistic from last March -- and 67 percent of all digital books.  That\\'s big.  That\\'s a big power player.  It\\'s worth talking about.  And it naturally raises the question, you know, how did the company get so big.  How did they have so much market share?  Why are they so dominant?  My argument is, they\\'re so dominant in this space because they\\'re the reader\\'s friend.  Who buys books?  It\\'s readers.  Amazon sells books to the vast majority of readers because it\\'s good for readers.  Another argument -- you know, Frank has written that Amazon is some kind of a monopoly, some kind of an abusive force that\\'s dominating the marketplace, maybe through nefarious means, something like that.  Some strategy other than being a reader\\'s friend.  And I think that that\\'s just not true, this idea that Amazon must be stopped by some kind of external force.  It doesn\\'t hold up, because the fact of the matter is even though Amazon has an extremely large share of the market, it faces a ton of competition.  I don\\'t know about you guys, but I\\'m the owner of an iPhone. I bet a lot of people in the audience may be -- may be iPhone users.  Yes?  No?  Yes. Yes? [applause] Matthew Yglesias: Maybe -- maybe some of you have a Google, an Android phone, something like that, yeah?  Yeah.  So, some people have Smartphones.  It turns out these phones, they\\'re directed -- they\\'re connected directly to digital stores.  You can go on iBooks on your iPhone.  You can go to the Google Play store on your Android.  And you can find How Soccer Explains the World.  You can find -- Frank edited a book called \"Jewish Jocks\" that I\\'ve been meaning to check out since I was in a debate in San Francisco with his co- editor.  And I actually -- I picked it up on my phone on the train.  You can find -- I\\'m not sure if it\\'s every Scott Turow novel, but a great deal of them.  They\\'re there in the Google store.  They\\'re there in the Apple store.  These are companies that are competing with Amazon. And they\\'re not, like -- these are not small, weak, pathetic, helpless companies, right? They\\'re actually bigger than Amazon.  Amazon is not going to drive Apple out of business.  They\\'re not going to drive Google out of business.  What they are doing is beating them badly in the electronic book space.  They\\'re selling way more books than those companies.  So, how is it that they\\'re doing that?  Did they do something sneaky? No.  They have a better product, right?  You can get Apple, Google on your phone.  You get them on your tablet.  But it\\'s Amazon who invested in creating the Kindle, which is a digital device that\\'s really meant for reading, you know?  I like to read books sometimes on my iPad.  It\\'s fun.  But my wife, she\\'s got a Kindle Paperwhite, and she loves it.  And I\\'ve been known to borrow it, because it -- it really is a better device for reading books on than what these other companies do.  They\\'ve also got a superior piece of software. If you download a Kindle book, you can read it on your Kindle, but you can also use the Kindle app on an iPhone, on an Android tablet. You can read it on the Web.  Apple and Google, they both want to make more exclusive, more locked-down platforms that don\\'t give you as much flexibility.  And that\\'s fine. Different companies have different strategies.  But normally, in a market, if you were going to offer an inferior product, you would try to beat your competitors on price.  But Apple and Google don\\'t do that either.  In fact, Apple tried to team up with book publishers to make prices higher.  So, it becomes pretty natural, you know?  Amazon has this market share because they have a better product, a better product than their digital competitors.  And if you compare it to their brick and mortar competitors, you know, there\\'s no -- there\\'s no competition.  It\\'s cheaper to get digital books.  It\\'s much more convenient to get digital books.  It\\'s much more flexible.  You can take them along when you\\'re traveling.  And Amazon also has a store where if you\\'re looking for something -- you know, you put it in there.  And if it doesn\\'t exist in a digital form, you can order the paper book, right?  That\\'s really neat.  It\\'s a good convenience, because when there\\'s something you want to read, you know, you really want to get the text that you want. You don\\'t care as much about the format. The other digital companies don\\'t do that.  All of which is you know, it\\'s a long way of getting to the point, but it\\'s to say that Amazon has won its market share the best possible way to win market share.  It\\'s by doing a better job, offering a better service at a better price.  Long story short, they\\'re the reader\\'s friend, you know?  So, we\\'re debating this in New York City.  New York is a great city.  I know New York very well.  I grew up here.  I grew up on 12th Street and University Place, down in the Village.  And I remember, when I was a kid, right in the neighborhood, you know, you could go to Broadway.  There was a Shakespeare and Company down maybe on 4th Street.  There was a Forbidden Planet, which had comic books and specialty sci-fi books.  You have the Strand, which is this fantastic used bookstore.  We had I think it was the original outlet of Barnes & Noble over a few blocks further north from there.  And, of course, you also have here in New York probably the greatest public library system in the world.  This is like part of what makes New York an amazing place. But it\\'s important when you\\'re thinking about this issue to not think with these sort of narrow New York blinders on and to recall that you know lots of people live in places that are not as big, places that do not have as many -- did not traditionally have as much diversity in terms of book retailing, where you might be talking about a lengthy drive to one bookstore, a limited selection that\\'s there, a library that, you know, maybe has some capacity to get loans from other places, but, again, it had its own kind of constraints.  What you have in the digital space, it\\'s this vast stockpile, you can get any kind of book you want.  You can go get public domain books, download them for free off Amazon.  And this is a -- really like an incredible bounty.  I think there\\'s a red herring out there that on one side of this debate is people who love Amazon and on the other side of the debate are people who think books are an important cultural artifact.  Culture matters.  Books are crucial to our society.  And that\\'s exactly why it is so important that Amazon has made it cheaper, easier, and more convenient for people all around the country and in a growing number of countries, to access these crucial cultural artifacts. Books aren\\'t widgets.  Books matter.  And that\\'s why it\\'s so important that you recognize that Amazon truly is the reader\\'s friend and vote for this resolution.  Thank you.', \"So, I think it's just false that Amazon is impossible for new startups to compete with.  I think -- I bought these glasses at Warby Parker, which is an online glasses store.  I got this suit from Alton Lane, which sells men's clothing online.  I actually did get my socks at Amazon. [laughter] Matthew Yglesias: But you see, I mean, venture capitalists in Silicon Valley are, in fact, willing to back online retail competitors to Amazon because they don't think it has the same kind of network effects as a Google or a Facebook.  And you also see -- I mean, I said this in my original point, and I haven't heard it addressed, but eBooks are sold by companies that are not Amazon, by well-financed companies called Google and called Apple.  Amazon has market share vis--vis those companies not because of a nefarious power but because Google and Apple have not brought forth a better product at a better price. And that's unfortunate.  I mean, I wish that they cared as much about the book market, but it restrains Amazon's ability to raise prices or squeeze consumers or do any of these other terrible things.\", 'Exactly.', \"Well, look, Scott just said otherwise.  He correctly pointed out that Apple was not originally in the book market. They didn't care as much about books as Amazon did, but when they saw that Amazon was taking over they wanted to move in.  This is, again, I mean, this is not like a small mom and pop operation Apple is running.  They came in like in a big way.  They haven't gained much market share because their product is not quite as good, but if Amazon did any of these horrible things or if book publishers had any confidence in their own ability to market authors around Amazon and say hey, we got this amazing Scott Turow book, why don't you find it on our hugely popular internet store, they could sell them to these people. Male Speaker: Okay. Matthew Yglesias: Be the e-retailer.\", 'Yeah, but they kind of are.', 'All right.', \"So, you know, advances is like a super-important subject here.  And here's the fact of the matter.  You have to understand. Book publishers, the big ones that we're talking about that are here -- these are commercial enterprises.  They're subsidiaries of big multi-national for-profit companies. They don't offer these advances because they're careless and just throwing money around like drunk morons.  And they don't do it as an act of charity.  I mean, there is, in fact, philanthropic support for certain kinds of non-profit work.  Lots of important non- fiction books are written by professors at universities, et cetera.  Et cetera.  But book publishers pay advances because it's part of their business model, because as you say, it's required to get the book written.  And so, the question is that either makes financial sense or it doesn't, right?  Giving people the advance in exchange for a cut of their sales is either a profitable business to be in -- in which case people will continue to do it in the future -- or else it's not a profitable business to be in, in which case it's going go away -- regardless of what happens with e-books, and whatever else like that.  So, I think it's a total red herring.  And I think, again, to focus this on the question of --  no one is denying that Amazon is not the book publisher's friend. But is it the reader's friend, right?  They're squeezing these publishers, but they're doing it -- they're trying to sell books.  You sell books to readers.  And you sell books to readers by making books affordable and by making them accessible.  That's what Amazon is doing.  That's what makes Amazon the reader's friend.  And if you care about books, pound the table, culture, yes, culture is great.  That's why it's great to make books more affordable and more accessible.\", \"Traditional book publishers are much too incompetent to be a tyranny. [laughter] Matthew Yglesias: I agree with Frank.  In principle, there's no reason why there can't be coexistence.  And if you look at the movie industry or the music industry you see competing digital retailers and you see publishers of these things.  And that's because movie studios are good at marketing movies.  So, they do not need to fear any one distribution platform because they will sell their movies through other ones.  Book publishers are bad at their job of marketing books.  That's why they're afraid of Amazon. [applause]\", 'I -- you know what, let me just quote my opponent, Frank Foer, on Amazon.  He said, \"They want nothing else to breathe on this planet except their consumers,\" which is to say, \"their readers.\"  You know, I wear some different hats, I\\'m an editor at a website, I\\'ve written books, but as a reader I absolutely trust Amazon, not because I have some crazy blind faith in them but because their business model is getting more people [unintelligible].', \"Well, as I've been trying to say -- that is a made-up world --\", \"-- in which you're wishing away Apple and Google.\", 'Amazon is definitely not a friend to competing bookstores.  I mean, that article is all about the benefits -- the many benefits that Amazon has brought to consumers through its relentless competitive spirit.', \"Editing is fantastic.  I mean, I'm an editor in my day job at a website.\", \"I am.  I keep the gates of what articles go up on the site.  And I'm also a writer, and I feel like my writing has always been improved by editing.  But you can see when you look, I mean, the world of writing is much bigger than the world of book publishing.  And there's lots of different ways in which editing gets done between the final publication of something and the initial conception of it.  And so I think when editors are adding value to writers and to readers, which I think they often are, there are ways to make that happen.  I think the particular way that editing of books happens, the sequence from the writer, to the agent, to the publisher, to the editor who works for the publisher, you know, that is being several challenged by the current dynamic. But anyone who really cares about making their writing better, finds ways to work with editors.  And that happens in newspapers, it happens in magazines, it happens in websites, and it'll continue to happen.\", \"You know, listen.  Future business models, that's tough, I -- you know, I could be like a book visionary, but I'm not.  I'm just an editor on a website.  But the fact of the matter is you can imagine lots of different ways this works, right?  You can imagine companies that just don't happen to be the existing big five publishing companies doing a similar sort of service, where they look at drafts and when they find drafts that they think are promising, they agree to edit them, work on them, and improve them in exchange for a percentage of the sales.  That's not like a crazy business to be in.  The book publishing business has worked along that kind of model for a long time.  It often is the case when technologies change that the particular incumbent companies lose out, but something sort of similar takes its place.  I think that you've seen in the journalism world that I'm in, right, that some old companies have struggled. Some old companies have thrived.  Some new companies have come out, but this stuff that's really valuable in terms of like writing, reporting, editing, that still happens at all different kinds of places and I think you'll see the same thing in publishing.\", \"I think that Scott is skipping a lot of logical steps when he gets -- so, what he is actually describing is not a world in which Amazon has ruined literary culture. He's describing the fear -- a fear that I think a lot of people share, and not totally unreasonably, that readers -- maybe the world just doesn't want to pay for great literature.  And I think that's an interesting question, right?  I mean, maybe, Netflix will destroy literary culture.  And -- but that's not what we're debating here, right?  I think any world where there are people, talented authors with great books that they want to write, and if there are readers who want to get their hands on great books, there is just no way that Amazon, as a retail layer in the middle, is somehow preventing that from happening.  There are plenty of ways that you could put books up for sale that don't involve Amazon.  There's no sign that Amazon has some objection to great books being sold on its platform.  Amazon is trying to sell as much stuff to as many people as they possibly can. And these other sort of questions -- big questions about the future of books -- are very important.  But we have to understand that, like, Amazon's commitment to serving readers and to serving the book market in a digital world is part of what helps books stay viable in a world where they face competition from all kinds of other entertainment.\", '[unintelligible] --', 'No.  No.  No.  Let me try to respond to it as clearly as possible.', \"If their argument is that in a counterfactual world, in which no other websites existed, that then, in that world, Amazon would be a threat to literature and to readers, that's true. But it also tells you that in the actual world, where there are lots of other websites, it isn't the kind of threat they pose -- but to generate this threat, they have to assume a crazy series of subsequent events that take us from here to this dystopia. [applause]\", 'Yes.  Theres no possible way it could happen.', \"You know, something that connects I think the last two points that I saw recently is that the world of public domain books, you know, books that are old and out of copyright, thanks to Amazon you can go online like right now and you can get the complete works of Jane Austen for free.  That's pretty great for readers, it seems to me, and not something traditional publishers are interested in doing, they're not making money that way.  And it's just an example of the way in which a relentless desire to kind of serve this digital market, to serve consumers, to gain as big a share as possible, has really made Amazon a reader's friend by getting that long tail, including the books that are completely free, out there and into the hands of as many people who want --\", \"He's the Amazon of the audience. Male Speaker: So, my name is Stephen [spelled phonetically].  I'm a full disclosure business student, and textbooks are expensive.  But getting to my real question -- so there's plenty of other destructive business models happening, whether it be in the music industry with Spotify and the like, but ultimately the adaptability I think ends up generating more value for the users.  So, whether it be the Amazon be the reader's friend or the publishing houses be the reader's friend, I kind of wonder in this unrest in the book economy what you guys view as the projection of being value added for the reader.\", \"Well, you know, the -- [applause] Matthew Yglesias: -- the stock is actually down 25 percent over the past year and -- Male Speaker: Almost a [unintelligible] dollars. Matthew Yglesias: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, I mean, 25 percent is a lot, and that's during the context of a rising stock market. And I think that's happening because the investing community has begun to lose faith in this idea that this kind of cut prices to the bone, dominate everything then jack the prices up, it's dawning on them that that doesn't really work, that you can build a successful business of low margins and high volume and that  there's some real value to that, but that this like monopoly doomsday scenario of theirs is not realistic and it's not financially realistic.  That's why you've seen share prices starting to go down.  That's why you've seen investors backing new e-retail startups, because they see there isn't this kind of opportunity for monopolization that people fear.\", \"Well, I mean, I don't think it's true that the stock market even thinks it's a realistic scenario.\", \"I don't, yes, and I think investors --\", \"Well, they've started to become interested, but this is --\", \"Scott, I understand that, but I'm saying this is the question, right, is do they have the ability to first secure monopoly then jack up prices and receive these huge [unintelligible].\", \"Wall Street feels that they don't have that opportunity, which is why their stock prices started to go down.  Now if you want to talk specifically about books and price increases we should talk about the time the big five book publishers and Apple formed a cartel to fix prices and raise them.  That's why e-book prices have gone up, which is separate from Prime and Amazon and all that other stuff.\", \"I think it's really important when you consider voting on this motion to really think about and listen to the arguments that our opponents have made.  They have raised a lot of interesting ideas.  But they're all -- they're these very complicated, very hypothetical ideas with a lot of red herrings and a lot of distractions from the core question here, which is, has Amazon been and is it now a friend to readers?  I mean, they haven't really disputed that it is, that Amazon has made books cheaper, that Amazon has made books more convenient, that Amazon is outcompeting the largest and richest technology companies in the world by offering a superior platform for shopping for books.  Now, it is true that if many, many things that are not true became true at some hypothetical time, through impossible mechanisms, Amazon might be an enemy to readers in that world.  I studied philosophy in college and this possible world stuff -- it's fascinating. And you can -- thanks to Amazon -- go buy David Lewis's book about the causal analysis of counterfactuals.  You can get edited volumes that were written by his students.  And you can really mull through this kind of stuff about these complex things.  But if there was no Amazon, it would be extremely difficult to find David Lewis's book or all those other books about the metaphysics of causality, hypotheticals, et cetera -- because you know, brick and mortar bookstores have limited spaces.  They don't want to carry that crap.  You know, maybe right by a college campus they would, but in general, no. Amazon is the reader's friend.  You can get all these books there.  And that's pretty great, you know?  Do they want to take over the world?  Sure.  Of course they do.  And their nefarious plan for taking over the book world is to create the cheapest, best, and most convenient way to buy books.  They are the reader's friend.  That's how they got so big.  That's why we're debating this. Other people with other interests have legitimate beefs with Amazon, but they got those beefs because Amazon is the reader's friend.\"]\n",

      "['Well, thanks, John.  Yeah, that was a reward given along with two of my academic colleagues for basically developing the tools that have allowed us to create the GMO crops.', 'Yep.', \"And I'm joined tonight by my partner, Alison Van Eenennaam, who is going to talk about the technology as well and the benefits.\", \"John, thanks.  And I really appreciate the opportunity to be here.  This subject is very important to me.  It's really been my life.  It started -- I grew up on a -- on a family farm in the central part of the United States.  I was one of those -- I wouldn't have thought of myself as a nerd, but I was one of those kids who always knew he wanted to be a scientist.  And I had the -- I had the unique privilege, after getting my doctorate degree, to attend the University of California at San Francisco, which was kind of the epicenter where GMO research started. And even back then, it was pretty clear that GMO technology would have a profound implication in health care.  And just as a quick test of the audience -- how many of you know anybody who's a diabetic and takes insulin?  So, a lot of hands. [applause] So, actually, insulin was the first GMO product.  And now, you know, that's the typical treatment.  And it's a safer, better product.  Today, in health care, just to give you a sense of the transformation, six of the top-selling drugs in the United States are based on GMO technology.  So, tremendous progress.  Let me -- let me make it a little more food related.  How many of you eat cheese? [applause] All right.  The first actual GMO product ever approved for food use was a product called rennet.  Rennet is the enzyme that's actually used to make cheese.  And today, 90 percent of our cheeses are based on GMOs, using a safer approach and a more effective way of making the technology. So, as I said in the introduction, you know, I helped develop the first GMO plants back in the -- in the early 1980s.  And then we took about another 15 years of additional studies and development before the first commercial products were launched in the -- in the mid 1990s.  And those were products that helped farmers protect against insects and protect against weeds.  So, for insect protection, we actually use the very same BT protein that is used by organic farmers for years, and built that into the plants to protect them from insects.  And as a result of that, we saw dramatic reduction in insecticide use and an increase in -- in crop yields.  And the herbicide tolerant crops, and herbicide tolerant crops have been a great enabler.  They've enabled farmers to use safer and more environmentally friendly chemicals and replace the products that were previously used, but they've also had a profound benefit to the environment, of enabling farmers to not plow their soils. And as a result, use less energy, release less carbon, and -- and reduce erosion, which have been key.  Today, if you look around the world, GMO crops are grown in about 27 countries.  They're being used by 18 million  [unintelligible] farmers.  And to put it in perspective, this has been the most rapidly-adopted technology in the history of agriculture.  And that's because the benefits have been so real and so clear.  As I said, it's reduced pesticide use.  It's helped farmers to produce more food and bring it, you know, from their harvest into -- into the -- into the -- into consumption.  It's preserved our soils.  It's reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a lot of benefits.  Now, you're going to hear different perspectives tonight on the technology.  But here's a simple logic test.  As I said, I grew up on a farm.  I've watched my dad make those decisions on which seeds to buy, which equipment to use, et cetera, et cetera.  I can tell you that there's no farmer who would plant GMO crops if they didn't have a real benefit. And they certainly wouldn't have planted them for the last 20 years if they didn't have real value.  So, the impact of GMOs has been amazing, and lots of applications across companies and universities.  And my partner, Dr.  Alison Van Eenennaam, is going to describe a lot of those applications that are still being developed.  I'd like to step back and say, as a scientist and a father, the safety of these products is -- is absolutely on the -- on the top of my mind.  And what I'm most proud about is the fact that these technologies have been in the marketplace for over 20 years, and there's not been a single, not one issue of food or feed safety ever associated with the technology.  And I'd make this point, that there's a strong scientific consensus on the safety of GMOs, as I -- as there is on the role of greenhouse gases and climate change, so that's -- that's very important.  The last area I'd like to highlight is that the safety actually starts with the fact that mankind has been genetically modifying and selecting crops from the beginning of time. And whether you're looking at modern-day corn or tomatoes, or you're looking at peaches or soybeans, we've been moving genes around from the -- from the beginning of time.  But through biotechnology, we're able to do it even more precisely, literally one gene at a time, and that's key.  Also, this technology is highly regulated.  It's regulated by the government agencies in the U.S.  But it's important to realize that we export grains to 40 countries around the world who have all researched and approved these products.  Alison's going to talk about some of the safety studies.  Bottom line from those studies is these are the most thoroughly studied foods in our food supply, and they are absolutely safe.  Now, let me make a couple of quick points as a scientist who's been involved in this his -- his whole career.  First of all, GMOs are not the Holy Grail.  What they are is an important tool, if used properly, can have a huge impact in bringing remarkable new products to farmers and benefit consumers for a long time. Second, GMOs aren't the only tool we need.  We need to continue to invest in plant breeding, we need to continue to invest in new areas like precision agriculture.  We need to invest in organic farming techniques and other tools.  And finally, let me just say, GMOs, are they perfect?  Absolutely not.  You know, they need to be regulated, they need to be managed wisely, like -- like any technology.  And, for example, we know that insects can become resistant to GMO crops just like they can to other insecticides. We know that -- that weeds can evolve resistance, whether, you know, to herbicides, whether those are herbicides used in GMO crops or other systems.  But I also know that -- and I acknowledge that these are legitimate concerns, but I also know that the science can make a huge impact to manage these technologies.  So -- and this is so key as we -- as we think about the future, because we are on the brink of facing one of mankind's greatest challenges.  Global population continues to grow. It's going to reach 9.5 billion by 2050.  Another 2 or 3 billion people will join the middle class.  The demand for food will double by 2050.  And so the decisions we make and the votes that you make tonight are really important.  We will need to produce more food in the next 36 years than we have in the entire history of the world.  So, it's a daunting challenge, and we're going to have to do that in the face of climate change and water shortage as we go forward.  But I want to be clear, and I want to leave you with this optimistic note as I summarize.  We can do this, but it means working together, and it means --\", '-- finding a common ground.', '-- and using all of our tools so --', 'Thank you.', \"So, first of all, you know, don't want to repeat what I said earlier, but, you know, this science is -- has been around literally since the 1970s and had broad applicability to health and agriculture with an impressive safety record. I mean, not a single issue of animal or human safety with the technology.  That's because it's inherent that we've been moving genes from the beginning of time, but also, I just want to illustrate how important the regulatory oversight has been.  Chuck and I first met when we put in place the USDA EPA and FDA oversight, which is still the gold standard around the world.  But every country that we ship corn or soybeans to around the world has already done their independent health and safety assessments as well as literally thousands of academic studies that all point to the same conclusion that's been codified by every major science organization around the world.\", 'These products are safe.', \"If you look at Alison's review, there's over two dozen long term animal studies that point to exactly the same answer, that these products are safe, and that's absolutely a fact. And the same agencies that have reviewed all of this data are the same agencies that have reached the same conclusion on the gravity of science around global warming. You know, you go to the National Academy, you go to all of the major organizations, at some point, you know, if -- consensus doesn't mean everybody agrees, it doesn't mean that there's a complete 100 percent alignment just like there isn't on global warming, but the science speaks for itself there, and the science has reached a consensus on this.\", 'So --', \"-- I'd be happy to respond to that, although it's, you know, someone else's product. But I just want to come back to --\", \"[inaudible].  I'll return to it.  So, the question -- we got into this -- was --\", '-- [inaudible] --', 'I know you do a great job of it, John.', \"Perfect.  That'd be -- that'd be great.\", 'Yeah.', 'Right.  So --', \"Sure.  So let's talk about it.  So, the issue is, to get the products sold in the United States, you get FDA, USDA, and EPA approval.  But then you get the import approval from all the countries around the world.  Syngenta got the approval for every country but China. And China is notoriously slow in their regulatory process.  And you know, there may be a little politics involved in this particular case.  But they got 38 out of 39 import approvals, and there's one more to go.  And I know they've been working really hard to get that approval And you know, it's unfortunate, when there's a market disruption.  But it probably wouldn't surprise folks here to know that there's sometimes a little bit of politics and a little bit of mischief behind the scenes.  And that's what's going on here.\", \"Sure.  So, just, you know, you said a lot about trade.  Let me just make the point.  60 percent of the U.S. corn gets exported around the world and a third of our soybeans to markets that accept these products.  We are the breadbasket to the world.  It's unfortunate when there's a disruption, but it's been really minor against the context of the benefits that these products have provided for food security. The point I was trying to make on the safety studies is each of these genes is regulated, individually looked at, and they are also looked at collectively, and there is no reason to believe that they have any concern in terms of stacking them together.  In fact, Chuck, I remember one of the first times we met.  You actually reminded me that the best way to bring this technology into the marketplace was to bring multiple products together so we had more durability and better insect protection.  In so many cases, the industry's done exactly what you've said.\", \"I don't think so. [talking simultaneously]\", \"Yeah, let me reel all the way back in terms of the herbicide tolerant crops and the benefits they provided.  So, in the old days, when I was a kid growing up, I'd come home from school, I'd get on my dad's tractor, and we'd plow all the fields this time of year, and we'd turn all the dirt over, and that was the method that people used to kill weeds. The big benefit of Roundup ready crops is it gave farmers the ability to use Roundup. How many of you in the audience have ever used Roundup to control weeds?  I mean, it's very effective.  It's a very safe product.  It's generally regarded as the gold standard. So it gave farmers a more environmentally friendly and a safer tool for controlling weeds.  But the huge benefit, and absolutely the huge benefit of herbicide tolerant crops has been the fact that it has basically eliminated tillage.  We don't plow fields any more.  We don't expose that dirt to evaporation of the moisture.  We don't have the erosion.  We don't have the instantaneous release of greenhouse gasses when the flip the soil over.  And since the adoption of herbicide tolerant crops in this country in the mid '90s, the rate of not plowing, of using conservation tillage has more than doubled.\", \"That's a huge benefit.\", \"Sure, absolutely.  It's real simple.  Evolution is alive and continues.  And, frankly, you know, we're going to see, as I think we get into issues of climate change and changes in microenvironments, we'll probably see more evolution and more resistance.  Here's a simple question:  You've all heard of antibiotic resistance.  It's a problem, right?  You're aware of it.  So what should drug companies do?  Should they not develop new antibiotics just because there's become a resistance to an antibiotic?  Absolutely not. Roundup controls hundreds of weeds.  In this country, 12 of them have become resistant.  It still controls hundreds of weeds.  It needs to be used effectively.  And, Chuck, you were one of the first ones to point out that we should actually use combinations of herbicides.  And that's what growers are doing today, and that's one of the benefits of being smarter and stewarding these products better.\", \"Because you asked the question, what kind of testing is required and what do we need to do?  And that's so relevant here, because the testing requirements are developed by the USDA, specifically to look at the evolution of pests and the impact on the environments.  We do studies for several years to do the analysis that's  being reviewed by the agencies for their environmental impacts.  And that's one of the key questions. The impact on the ecosystems, the -- on other species.  That's all built into that regulatory system.  And it's built on the fact that in this country, we have been developing new crops from the beginning of time.  New corn hybrids, new soybean varieties, new cotton varieties.  And that experience from plant breeding has given us the insights and base the regulations in terms of how the GMO crops are regulated.\", 'Based on real, practical, real-world experience.', 'Go ahead.', \"So, generally, there's not alignment on those studies.  Either their validity or their appropriateness for these types of products and there's not even recognition of that by the government agencies in this country.  We comply to the laws of the United States and all the countries that we -- that, you know, import our crops.  We are the breadbasket of the world.  Two-thirds of the corn ships around the world to Europe, to Asia, and to other countries.\", 'And the standard for safety is [unintelligible] --', 'Okay.', 'Thanks, John.', \"First of all, thanks for that.  I was going to say that we might actually have reached -- reached some alignment.  We've talked a lot about our differences.  And one of the points I wanted to make -- you cited the National Geographic.  I give that same speech all the time.  I absolutely believe that, you know, this is a complicated challenge, of feeding the world. It's going to take increased productivity and efficiencies, and that's clear, and that's where these tools come into play.  It's also important that we reduce food waste.  And, you know, there's things that we can do by protecting crops or providing refrigeration and diets.  I absolutely agree.  It's a complicated question that will take all the tools we have.\", 'Excuse me.  Let me --', \"Can we -- we can address that if you want to.  But let me just -- let me complete my thoughts.  Food security challenge is the biggest challenge we face.  We have to double the available food in 36 years.  It's important that we make the right decisions today. The other important point on farming -- and we've talked a lot about small farmers.  My mentor was a guy named Dr.  Norman Borlaug.  And Norman always made the point that if you help a farmer, you help poverty.  70 percent of the world's poor are farmers. If you give them better tools to farm even incrementally better, you address not only poverty, but you address food security.  And so these are all complex interrelated issues. There are no simple solutions.  But I think we should play the game with all of our tools.\", 'Let me take a quick response.', \"I had -- you know, we're dangerously close to common ground here.  I absolutely believe everything you said.  In fact, let me just tell you a little bit of a secret.  You know, I run the research program for Monsanto.  We spend exactly twice as much of our research dollars on plant breeding as we do on biotech.  Absolutely plant breeding particularly assisted by these molecular tools has a great opportunity and has a huge impact internationally.  We work with the Gates Foundation to use these tools to breed -- to breed drought resistant maize for Africa, and we're working with them on other projects so I couldn't agree more.\", \"You know, I think the debate around GMO crops sucks all the air out of the room. [applause] Robert Fraley: I think we're to the point where it's become a side show.  It's become a distraction.\", 'Could you restate the question? [laughter]', \"I think only if we stop investing in the science in the future.  You know, absolutely, you know, I've mentioned in my opening remarks, you know, concern over resistance development is a concern that's been a concern from the beginning of time.  But we have incredible tools.  I'm actually proud of the fact that we are developing our third and fourth generation technologies and staying ahead of the curve.  And if we can move forward with the science and all of the tools -- I mean, we need to make the advances in breeding, we need to make the advances in biotechnology, tremendous opportunity for precision agricultural tools to farm more smartly, we're going to need all of these tools. We have to double the food supply in 36 years.  What wakes me up in the morning is I know we can do it if we can reach alignment on moving forward and using the common ground. We all care about food security.  We all care about the environment.  Let's get smart and move forward.\", \"Thanks for a great debate and for listening to the commentary.  I hope it's helped provide you more insight into the important science and the important tools that GMOs represent.  What I'd like to do is actually highlight what a vote against the motion really means, what it would be like to live in a world without GMO crops, what that would look like.  First thing, there'd be a significant impact to the land.  Without GMOs, farmers would need to dramatically increase their use of herbicides and insecticides.  I estimate it to be about 100 million pounds added to the environment each year. Second, since GMOs improved yields and helped farmers deliver more food in their absence means we're going to have to farm more land. And you know, it's going to take about 120 million acres more land to just keep where we are today.  That's about one California or four New York states.  And the pressure that will put on will mean -- it will drain more wetlands, will cut down more forests. We'll look at more prairielands, because people will fundamentally eat.  Third, voting against the GMO technology really means exacerbating climate change, because it means we go backwards.  We have to manufacture more chemicals.  We have to take tractors and run up and down the fields and plow, and we release more greenhouse gas emissions.  Banning GMO crops is equivalent to taking and putting 26 million new cars on the road from a greenhouse perspective.  It also means higher food prices.  North Carolina State just published a study showing that the average family going in -- not using GMO crops adds about $3,000 a year to their food bill.  And that impacts everybody, and we all bear the cost of that.  And finally, voting against GMOs means forgoing all those opportunities that Dr.  Van Eenennaam had talked about.  You know, it's a relatively new technology.  The future is ahead of us. We're at the tip of the iceberg stage in what's possible.  So, I hope, for the sake of all of our families -- and I hope for the sake of all the people on the planet -- that you vote to keep all of our options open and vote yes to support GM food.  Thank you.\"]\n",
      "[\"Well, I'm an urban girl, I was born in the city in Australia, and I'm kind of a science nerd, still am actually, and I was interested in how we might use science to improve the productivity of agriculture. And it's what I've spent my career pursuing.\", 'Wow, it\\'s a great turnout here tonight, its not my usual audience.  I spend a lot of my time talking to farmers and ranchers.  And it\\'s my pleasure to be here speaking to you tonight.  I\\'d like to start with a premise that I hope we can all agree on, and that is in the future more people are going to need to be fed better with less environmental impact. And as a public sector scientist, my interest is finding real-world solutions to that problem. And to me GM food offers one of those solutions.  It\\'s derived from crops produced using a breeding method based on the movement of useful genes from one species into another.  Tonight I\\'ll spend some time discussing the impressive safety record of GM crops, how they\\'ve provided well-documented benefits, and how GM is sometimes uniquely able to deliver a useful trait like crops that are more resilient to climate change.  And I will contend that the benefits of GM are too great to vote anything but \"Yes\" for GM tonight.  GMO technology often gets conflated with Monsanto and Big Ag, but it\\'s actually a breeding tool, one that can be used for many purposes.  In my own research, in selection for disease resistant cattle, I use many breeding methods, including classical selection for healthy animals and, more recently, the use of DNA markers to assist in selecting for disease resistant genes. As a geneticist I can envision how combining GM with these other breeding methods, because they are not mutually exclusive, could accelerate the progress of my publicly funded research program by enabling me to use GM to directly protect cattle from infection.  This would be associated with reduced illness and the decreased use of antibiotics, something I think is perhaps a common shared value amongst this group.  As Robb mentioned, most commercialized GMO crops today have been made to resist insects and herbicides and have been adopted by 18 million farmers globally, but importantly 16.5 million of those farmers are in the developing world, both men and women, some of whom farm areas smaller than the size of the auditorium tonight. What have been the impacts of this widespread adoption?  As a scientist I go to the independent, peer-reviewed literature to answer such questions, especially reviews and meta-analyses that present a summary of many independent studies.  It\\'s like a well- informed referee presenting an objective assessment of the state of play. Recently, German university professors published a comprehensive analysis of 147 separate studies that assess the impact of GM crops.  They found that the benefits were significant not only in the U.S.  but more importantly in the developing world.  On average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37 percent, increased yields by 22 percent, and increased farmer profits by 68 percent.  The yield gains are due to more effective pest control and thus lower crop damage.  And the benefits have been largest for smallholder farmers in developing countries who have dramatically reduced their insecticide applications as a result of GM crops.  This has benefitted both farmer health and also the environment and beneficial insects.  Now researchers throughout the public and private sector are using this breeding tool to deliver other benefits to society.  Researchers at Hawaii and Cornell University have used it to produce a virus resistant papaya, a product which has literally saved the Hawaiian papaya industry. Other introductions include drought resistant corn, virus resistant squash, consumer traits like a non-browning apple, a low-acrylamide potato, and crops that produce oils improved for nutrition.  None of these applications require the use of any chemical pesticides, an issue that often gets conflated with this technology.  University researchers are working to develop GM oranges that are resistant to citrus greening disease, something that is devastating the Florida orange industry.  And here in New York, researchers are using a wheat gene to develop GM American chestnut trees resistant to the imported chestnut blight.  If approved, these trees will be distributed to the public in a not for profit program to restore the American chestnut tree to the eastern forests.  Plant diseases annually destroy some 15 percent of our world\\'s agricultural harvest, a number that is likely to grow as our climate changes. There are many publicly funded groups around the world, working to develop GM- disease resistant varieties of crops, including apples, bananas, cassava, cowpea, eggplant, grapes, potatoes, rice, sweet potatoes, and wheat.  Some of these staple crops are an essential source of nutrient in the diets of the poor.  And it doesn\\'t stop at plants. Researchers at CUNY are working with an international consortium to develop genetically-engineered cattle that are resistant to African Sleeping Sickness, a disease that kills several thousand people and three million cattle annually.  This project is being publicly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.S.  National Science Foundation.  All of these GM applications focus on controlling disease with genetics rather than chemicals, an objective that I would argue is compatible with agroecology, sustainability, and feeding more people better with less environmental impact.  There are literally dozens of other applications and field trials globally. Nitrogen-efficient and flood-tolerant rice.  Drought-tolerant wheat.  And BioCassava Plus, a private-public partnership that will use GM to increase the nutrient levels, shelf life, and disease resistance of cassava, a major source of carbohydrates in parts of the world.  Improved cassava harvests could increase the incomes of African households, helping lift poor farmers -- many of them women -- out of poverty.  I could go on, but none of this would be possible without the broad scientific consensus about the safety of GM and solidated [spelled phonetically] and support that consensus.  A 2013 review article, written by independent Italian public sector scientists, reviewed over 1,700 scientific records on GE crop safety published this past decade, and concluded that the scientific research conducted so far has not detected any significant hazards directly connected with the use of GE crops.  My own 2014 review paper examined both well- designed animal feeding studies and the field performance and health trends of the over 100 billion food producing animals that have been consuming GM feed over the last decade, and found no credible evidence of harm. The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world\\'s largest and most prestigious scientific society, stated in 2012 that science is quite clear: crop improvement by modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe.  They\\'re joined by the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the U.S.  National Academy of Sciences, the British Royal Society, and every major regulatory agency in the world.  Given the realized benefits, the potential of this science, and the documented safety record, I urge you to allow breeders to use this valuable method to improve crops and vote yes for tonight\\'s motion.', \"Sure, I mean, as a scientist like I would never make a blanket assertion about safety and I think it's very much dependent on each particular review.  But I think that as a scientist I let the data tell me whether there are safety concerns.  And after 20 years and thousands of studies and I feel the weight of the thousands of academic colleagues throughout the world that have done these safety studies --\", \"-- that haven't found unique concerns that I have to accept the evidence for what it is and let the data tell me whether it's safe.\", \"Well, I mean, I guess, as a breeder, we routinely stack traits.  We're always selecting for multiple traits going into the --\", '[inaudible] --', \"That's -- well --\", \"-- it's breeding.  You're always trying to improve multiple traits.  And I think I need to understand the scientific kind of hypothesis, why stacked traits would be more dangerous when the individuals are not separate.  I guess it's like looking at a broccolini, and you know broccoli is safe and the other plant that was crossed -- why would a broccolini be more dangerous than its two parents? So, what's your biological basis?\", \"Well, I mean, again, I think you've got to look at the application and what the actual product is.  And I think it's that the effective of BT crops has been a dramatic reduction in insecticide use, especially in the developing world.  And, I mean, I stated the summary of that paper which said the adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37 percent. So I think that, particularly BT crops have led to reduced use of insecticides.  There have been a number of studies that have looked at herbicides.  And depending upon which country you're talking about and which study and which crop. In some cases they've substituted Roundup for a different herbicide that they were using that was more environmentally degrading and  that stayed longer in the environment and so they've --\", '-- moved to a safer herbicide.', \"That's actually -- I mean, that's what's done as part of the agronomic assessment of the performance of GM crops.  But these were actual field studies done throughout the world by independent researchers looking at what the actual effects have been.  And the effects have been --\", \"Yeah, I mean, I think you're conflating the technology with other issues.  I don't -- the Monarch butterfly is due to more effective controls of the milkweed.  And so if we want more weed then we should grow more weed, but the fact that we're controlling the weed more effectively -- [laughter] -- I guess from California I probably shouldn't say that, should I?\", 'Sorry.', \"You know, there's been no association with GMs and honeybees.  I think that's just that, that's a red herring out there --\", '-- and -- [talking simultaneously]', 'No, you take it.', \"It's certainly not my area of expertise, but there are --\", 'Okay.', 'Well -- [laughter] Alison Van Eenennaam: Okay.', \"Well, I guess, to me, it's, what are the unique risks that all these safety studies are for? We're talking about a breeding method.  And the data shows that there's no unique risks.  And so we've -- we already do extensive studies that cost millions of dollars to bring these products to market.  If we're going to do more studies, it'll be even more expensive.  And I want to know what the unique risks are that we're looking for --\", '-- that are triggering these studies.', 'Can -- can I --', \"Can I address that?  I mean, I think that's a false balance.  You know, I don't think we have to choose one or the other.  And I think if you provide that farmer with an insect resistant crop like a BT, maybe then it's protected from insects and then also add some fertilizer, then maybe you can improve the yield sufficiently to feed his family and also sell some product and help lift himself out of poverty.  So, I don't think we have to choose one or the other.  I think that's a false balance.\", 'Yes.', 'Well, for example, we --', \"-- wheat tends to be done by public breeders.  And I know that the public breeders are using conventional selection and are basically locked out of using GM as a -- it's a synergistic tool.  It can be used for very specific things like disease resistance much more effectively, potentially.  And combining the two together would be a really beneficial thing.  And so I just don't see it as being mutually exclusive.  You have to do conventional breeding or genetic engineering.\", 'Well, there are certainly products in the pipeline that have been delivered and things like the disease resistant papaya.  And I guess as a public sector scientist I get a little bit frustrated by the same groups that are out there kind of scaremongering about the technology or at the same time saying, \"Why hasn\\'t anything come to market?\" because it\\'s really that, that\\'s stopping the public sector from developing these products. [applause]', \"This past week the U.S.  celebrated Thanksgiving, a wonderful holiday, and we had 14 people over to our house.  And as the hostess my task was to serve a safe delicious meal.  You know the drill, keeping the raw turkey out of contact with food surfaces, making sure you cook it enough to get rid of food borne illness but not so much as to be dry, all while drinking a glass of wine which probably added to the risks. But actually food poisoning is a real risk, and 3,000 people a year die of food poisoning. As we gave thanks for this abundant cornucopia, the one risk I was not concerned about was whether any of the food was genetically modified.  And I was serving this meal to the people I love most in the world, my dearest friends, my husband, my two teenage sons.  Their wellbeing is of paramount importance to me.  And as a parent it's my responsibility to use the best possible information to protect their health and to determine what the scientific consensus is on technology.  That is why my kids drink pasteurized milk and have had all of their childhood vaccinations.  Sometimes the risks that concern people and the risks that kill people are entirely different.  For too long the debate over the merits of genetically modified food has focused on unrealized hypothetical risks and has been conflated with the use of pesticides. It has not addressed how GM could help with the very real risks faced by the hungry and malnourished.  There are costs associated to excessive precaution.  Doing nothing is doing something.  During the 90 minutes we've had this debate, approximately 1,500 people died of hunger, more than all of you here in this room.  Hunger and malnutrition are real risks, risks that kill over 20,000 people daily.  And most of those who die are children.  These are not talking points; they're people.  As a mother and a scientist, what concerns me is the fear-mongering campaign against genetically-modified food has forced [unintelligible] scientists from using this breeding method to help produce more nutritious and sustainable food sources for millions of people.  Vote yes for GM food.\"]\n",

      "['Peter Singer:', 'Andrew Solomon:']\n",
      "['Sure, in one sentence, utilitarianism is the view that the right thing to do is the act that will have the best consequences, all things considered, of the options open to you.', 'Thank you.', \"That's correct.\", \"My partner is Andrew Solomon.  Andrew's a writer who's written very movingly about this issue.  He's also a public speaker.  And if you look at the talks he's given on TED, TED.com, you will find that eight million people have viewed them, whereas my talk has only been viewed by one million.\", 'Thank you.  Let\\'s be clear what we are debating this evening.  It\\'s \"Legalize Assisted Suicide.\"  It\\'s not \"Put Utilitarianism into Practice,\" and it\\'s also not anything further to do with other areas in which one may or may not think that sometimes death is preferable and ought to be provided. That is not the topic.  You\\'re asked to discuss -- to focus only on this quite narrow question.  Now, if you think about that question, we are, of course, influenced by the idea that normally death is a bad thing.  We often think of it as the very worst thing that can happen to us.  But if we ask ourselves why that should be, \"Why is death a bad thing?\" then we can think that there are a variety of reasons in normal circumstances.  For instance, people want to go on living, so death is contrary to that very strong wish that people have.  It violates their autonomy.  If somebody else in particular kills them, it normally violates their autonomy, which is something that we ought to respect.  Secondly, death ends your life, and most of us think of life as a positive, as a good thing, fortunately. So, it prevents you from continuing to live that life that you find worthwhile, that you find fulfilling and rich, that brings you happiness and other values.  And, thirdly, death is a bad thing for those who love and care for the person who dies.  It\\'s a source of grief to them that someone they love dies.  So that\\'s why normally, of course, we should not promote death, let alone kill people.  But there are very special circumstances in which none of these things apply, and that\\'s what we\\'re talking about tonight.  There are circumstances in which the person who is considering death wants to die. That is their autonomous choice. So, death is not a violation of their autonomy, or contrary to their strongest wishes. But it\\'s in accordance with them, as Andrew described in the case of his mother just now. Secondly, there are cases in which a person has no more valuable life to look forward to, valuable by their judgment, not valuable by somebody else\\'s judgment imposing on them the idea that their life is still worthwhile, even though they, having thought the matter through -- perhaps having thought it through for many years -- again, as in the case Andrew described, have decided that life would not be worth living for them under some circumstances. And in particular, if they have only a short time to live, as in the case of the statutes in Oregon and Washington, and now Vermont as well, then they know that they cannot look forward to more years of happiness. And as for the grief that those who love them will feel, of course they will feel that grief if they die now. But in the cases covered by these statutes, where people are terminally ill and likely to die -- two doctors certify that they will die, they have less than six months to live, then the family is going to grieve anyway. And the caring family -- like Andrew and his brother -- will at least feel that the person they love got to die at a time of their own choosing. And that\\'s important. Now, in fact, this idea that this is sometimes a good thing is recognized by our opponents. Daniel Sulmasy just said that sometimes it\\'s justifiable to relieve patients\\' pain, if you\\'re hastening death. It\\'s not the hastening death that they object to, because they acknowledge that you can withdraw treatment that would keep patients alive -- sometimes would keep patients alive for a long time. It\\'s the intention of ending a patient\\'s life that they object to. But we don\\'t have to accept that morality. That\\'s a specific morality which Daniel Sulmasy is free to hold, of course. And if he -- as he said at the beginning -- would not like you -- to help you end your life, that\\'s entirely up to him. Nobody is suggesting he should be compelled to end anyone\\'s life against his conscience. But if a different doctor -- and there are such doctors -- is willing to do that, indeed, thinks that that\\'s the best final care that he can give to a patient who he can no longer restore to a situation that the patient considers worthwhile, then I don\\'t -- I don\\'t think we should be hung up by this idea that something is somehow always a wrongful intention, even if in normal circumstances, to aim at someone\\'s death would be a wrongful intention. But not in these circumstances. In these circumstances, it may be the right intention. Now, I\\'m sure we\\'re going to hear from probably Ilora Finlay, I guess, that there are risks  that this is a dangerous thing -- that it will lead to a slippery slope. That argument has been around in this debate for a long time. I think that when I first became interested in this question -- which now goes back about 40 years. That that was an argument that you had to treat very seriously and had to give a lot of weight to. And I could not be completely sure that it was not justified. But now we have much more experience of the legalization of assisted suicide. We have, in the Netherlands -- in fact, more than 30 years\\' experience of the open practice of -- by the medical profession, with the support of the Royal Dutch Medical Society -- not against the doctors\\' views -- of that practice. And with its full legalization, about 14 -- about 12 years ago. And fully supported by the Dutch population, so that although there\\'s been a succession of governments -- some conservative, some more liberal, one of them under a Roman Catholic prime minister -- they have not ever sought to repeal the legislation. And similarly, in Oregon, we now have 17 years of experience, a relatively small number of people dying each year. And as you heard, more of them requesting the prescriptions, but not using them, because they want the control. They want to know that they could end their life if they want to. So, with that experience, the experience of Belgium as well, which followed the Netherlands, its neighbor, and then Luxembourg, and then also Washington -- the state of Washington, the neighbor of Oregon, which was watching what was going on there, and decided that was a good system that they wanted, and therefore accepted it -- we have not seen a slippery slope here. We have, in fact, found that these -- this legalization is something endorsed by the populations concerned and supported by it, and they want it to continue. Thank you.', 'Look, I do disagree with it.  I mean, there\\'s a sense in which none of us is an island and every act could be seen as having some ramifications socially.  But this one is one that I think has very few.  And I don\\'t think that the implication that if you end your life somehow you\\'ve left a skeleton in the closet, that seems nonsense to me. And, after all, you\\'re making a decision, why wouldn\\'t you say the same to the patient who says, \"I don\\'t want any more treatment\"?  You know, you say patients have the right to refuse treatment, you say that Andrew\\'s mother didn\\'t need to have the chemotherapy, but, you know, why wouldn\\'t you say -- why couldn\\'t the doctor say, \"Look, this could keep you alive, maybe even you\\'ll live for another 23 years, who knows?\" like David?  You know, you can\\'t exclude it, but you\\'re quite happy to say to people, \"You can refuse treatment, you can withdraw burdensome treatment of various kinds -- the doctor can do that, you don\\'t have to accept it,\" so I don\\'t see really there\\'s such a big difference in terms of the ramifications here of, in both cases, a patient\\'s decision not to do what will prolong their life.', \"But why doesn't that apply to a decision to withdraws a ventilator.\", 'I mean, have you never seen a patient where a doctor said, \"I think we should take the ventilator away,\" and the patient actually lived quite a lot longer?', \"Look, as Andrew said, you can't say that it will never happen. But is it right to condemn a vastly larger number of people to suffer when they dont want to because there may, you know, in one in several thousand cases, perhaps, be somebody like the David and Ilora Finlay described? I don't think so. And I would, again, emphasize, I think the case that Daniel Sulmasy just brought up, with Karen Quinlan, precisely shows that they are making decisions when they withdraw treatment. She lived another nine years. She never recovered consciousness and she died without recovering consciousness. In my view, that was pretty pointless. But if you believe in intrinsic worth of human life, you shouldn't have seen the ventilator as futile, because the ventilator kept her alive -- was thought to be keeping her alive. And after it was removed, the feeding tubes were keeping her alive. So, was that a good thing? I mean, I don't think it was a good thing, I have to say. But it certainly shows that the decision about withdrawing treatment is just as much a decision that you can get wrong, and you can be dramatically shortening someone's life, as the decision that we're talking about.\", \"Yeah, I take it that Ilora Finlay is not denying that in the UK there are requests for physician-assisted suicide and that indeed there is a movement because you know very well that there is a bill in your own House, the House of Lords, which seemed to make some progress just the other day.  And it's also true that there are British subjects who have traveled from Britain to Switzerland in order to end their life because Switzerland allows nonresidents, unusually, to have assisted suicide, physician-assisted suicide.  So it's clearly the case that it's not just the U.S. system although, you know, I wish we could just snap our fingers and then we would have a wonderful U.S. health system in which nobody needed to end their life.  But it's not an easy task, as President Obama found out, to reform the U.S. healthcare system.  So unfortunately, we're going to have to live and die with the system that we have.  But I can't really imagine a system in which -- you know, in the foreseeable future in which there are no serious considered requests for physician-assisted suicide.\", \"But we are not wedded to the Oregon system or the Vermont system without saying that it could be improved.  I know that your House of Lords just accepted an amendment that there should be judicial review of doctors' decisions.  We are certainly welcome to consider those possibilities.  We are simply saying that there is a legal system of regulating assisted suicide which is worth implementing.\", 'No, that was just not true, sorry.  There was never a case when physician assisted suicide --', \"-- was legal or accepted and euthanasia was not.  But that's --\", \"-- [inaudible] they just didn't see that distinction.\", \"That's really not right.\", 'I find it a very sad story, actually, that that was so important to that woman, that sense of being a woman. But -- [applause]', \"Okay.  But -- and I think in a way it's trivializing the reasons why people ask for physician assistance in dying.  It's things like being nauseous, feeling breathless, being -- just being able to lie there and not being able to do anything.  I mean, it may be that pain can generally be controlled, or I've certainly read palliative care specialists who acknowledge that it can in every case, except as Daniel Sulmasy just said, by making the patient unconscious.  But, you know, that then is getting, I think, very close to what we're talking about.  I've seen surveys that say that the majority of American intensive care specialists have used terminal sedation, that is they sedate the patient to the point of unconsciousness. The patient, of course, then does not eat, and they don't tube feed the person, so the patient then dies.  I mean, what's the difference between giving the patient so many drugs that they're unconscious and then they're not fed and they die, or allowing them to take a drug which, at their choice and at their time, will end their life?\", \"But I think you have to accept, surely.  I mean, it's a fictional notion of intent to say that you intentionally make somebody unconscious knowing that you're not going to feed them and you're unintentionally ending their life?  Come on.\", \"No, I don't think we're asking them to risk their integrity --\", '-- we\\'re asking them to act with integrity, to consider carefully whether the circumstances are the ones that are prescribed in the law, as we said, could be -- have various kinds of safeguards and reviews, and will minimize those kinds of mistakes.  It is true that physicians, like everyone else, are fallible, and it is true that occasionally there may be a mistake, and it may be that somebody could have lived longer and even found their life worthwhile.  We\\'re not saying that that can never happen, because we know that in all human things, things could askew occasionally. But we don\\'t think these rare possible cases are sufficient to say that nobody else can have these choice, nobody else can make this decision that \"I\\'ve had enough,\" and that because of these very occasional mistakes, everybody else has to suffer through to the end whether they want to do that or not.', \"That's not the question.  You both evaded the question.  The question asked you to accept --\", \"-- the hypothesis that you can't relieve the excruciating pain.  It's an attempt to understand your underlying philosophical or ethical position.  And neither of you -- you've both just evaded that question.\", 'Thank you.', \"It's easier.\", 'We want you to support this motion because, firstly, we believe that people should be the ones to decide for themselves whether they think that continued life is worthwhile for them or not.  We don\\'t think that it should be up to anybody else to say, \"We think your life is worthwhile.\"  And, secondly, we think that there is a lot of unnecessary suffering, whether it\\'s excruciating pain or not, there is suffering and distress of various sorts which continues and is going to continue for the foreseeable future in this system and it could be relieved by a relatively simple legislative reform that exists already and has been shown to work.  Now, in fact, this region today took a little step closer to that.  You may not know that the New Jersey State Assembly today voted to pass the Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act which is similar to the other legislation that we\\'ve been discussing. [applause] It voted 41 to 31, so a fairly clear majority.  It still, of course, has to go to the Senate, and then it would need the assent of a candidate -- a governor who wishes to be the Republican candidate for the presidency -- [laughter] -- so it still has some way to go.  But I just want to quote one of the supporters of that whose name is Janet Colbert.  She\\'s a retired oncology nurse, so she knows a lot about cancer and about people dying from cancer.  She now herself has terminal liver cancer, but she supports this because she said, \"As I battle my illness I would like the choice and comfort that comes with the option of aid in dying.\"  That\\'s all we\\'re asking for.  Thank you.']\n",
      "[\"Well, it's somewhat less taboo, but in a society in which people tend to be in denial about the reality of mortality altogether, getting them to talk about this is still frequently a struggle.  But I think speaking about it openly, as we are doing tonight, is one way to help people be less afraid to tell their families or to tell their doctors what they actually think and feel.\", 'Because much of modern medicine prolongs not living but dying, we need to rethink death itself. Making someone die in a way that others approve, but that he feels is anathema, is an odious form of tyranny. Aid-in-dying needs to be tightly regulated, as any life or death matter does, from driving to surgery. But while no one should be pressed into assisted dying, no one should be categorically denied that right. It\\'s about dignity. In his dissent in Cruzan, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan said, \"An ignoble end steeped in decay is abhorrent. A quiet, proud death, bodily integrity intact, is a matter of extreme confidence. And it\\'s about reassurance. Brittany Maynard, who captured headlines for choosing to end her life at the age of 29 at the end of a battle with brain cancer, said, \"It has given me peace. I do not want to die, but I am dying, and I want to die on my own terms.\" It\\'s not about depression. When hope of recovery is gone, when one achieves relief from physical symptoms only at the cost of mental clarity, when  ones dignity is lost to physical deterioration, the wish to end your life may be rational. Now, there are some people who find great meaning in those very final stages. But there are other people who are not interested in finding that meaning. And from a non-theological point of view, it can be argued that the meaning people attach to that stage of life is an artifact of the human imagination. It\\'s not about suicide. Suicide responds to personal disintegration while this precludes it. And it is about the limitations of medicine. It\\'s nothing short of medical arrogance to say that palliative care and hospice can adequately deal with the end of every life. Hospice, in fact, can impose an authoritarian, hard, paternalistic view that the hospice way of dying is the only way, and it\\'s rooted in precedent, as John said in the opening, in Oregon, where after 17 years, only 752 people have died from lethal prescriptions, which is to say .2 percent of the people in the state who have died. As Hillary once hoped for abortion, this is safe, legal and rare, and it has popular support. According to a 2013 Gallup Poll, 70 percent of Americans support legalization of physician assistance in dying.  When my mother\\'s friend, Sandy, was dying of cancer, my mother visited and saw her in the hospital where she was screaming in pain and so heavily medicated that she was unable to recognize the other people in the room.  And when she came home, my mother said, \"If I ever get to that state of pain, promise that one of you will shoot me.\" My mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 56. And when her first chemotherapy failed, she said that she would submit to another round of agonizing treatment only on the condition that someone got her those pills. By the time of her third chemo, she was in dilapidated health.  She was vomiting.  She had a persistent malaise, she had hair loss, she was negotiating surgical adhesions, but she also had the pills.  And the agony became unimportant because the symptoms were permanent only until she decided that she could take no more, and then she would be free, and so the disease was no longer in control of her.  My grieving father, my mother, my brother and I talked through the logistics as though a dress rehearsal would exhaust some of the pain of the loss in advance.  We planned it together, much as we had once planned parties or family vacations or Christmas.  We were liberated by our newly clarified emotions, but we were entombed in the loneliness of our illegal collusion. My mother went to see a gastroenterologist two years after she got sick, who told her that she had significant tumors in her intestines and would soon be unable to digest food.  She called my brother and me, and she said that it was time.  It was all very much as we had planned it.  She said, \"The only thing I still fear is this not going smoothly.\"  And she took the antiemetics.  A few nights earlier, my mother and my brother had pulled a wishbone, and my mother had won.  And now my brother said to her, \"What did you wish for?\"  And she said, \"I wished for this to be over as quickly as possible. And I got my wish, I got my wishes so often.\"  And then she said, \"When you were children, I wanted my love to make the world a safe place for you. And my greatest hope is that it will still wrap you up for your whole life.\"  And she said to my father, \"I would gladly have given decades of my life to be the one to go first.  For 30 years, Howard, you have been my life.\"  And then as her voice slowed with the medication, she said, \"I\\'m sad to be going.\"  But even with this early death, I wouldn\\'t want to change my life for any other life in the world.  I have loved completely, and I have been completely loved, and I\\'ve had such a good time.  I\\'ve looked for so many things in this life, so many things.  And all the time, paradise was in this room with the three of you.\"  I\\'ve seen other deaths, and I remember feeling that they belonged to the hospital or the illness or the gun or the catastrophe. This death was my mother\\'s own.  She was the same person in death that she had been in life, and it was her right to choose it over a death like Sandy\\'s, and it should be everyone\\'s right.  The words \"liberty\" and \"dignity\" are nearly synonymous in death as they are in love.', \"Well, I think that actually we send a very dark message to the society at large when we say to people that they don't have the right to make these decisions, when we say to people that we look at their suffering and their anguish, and we refuse to help or support them.  I think that sends a social message.  I think people have a difficult time speaking openly and directly to doctors if they know that what they are discussing is illegal, and they don't know what their doctor's legal or ethical position on it is going to be.\", \"I think that a shift of this kind always has a range of social consequences, so I cannot say that they don't exist at all, but I would say that to me they are vastly outweighed by the benefits that are gained.\", \"Withdrawal of life support equipment requires a much more active role for the physician than the prescription of medication that someone can use to bring about the end of their own life. It involves the physical removal of equipment. It usually involves the administration of morphine to ease the person through the dying process. There's a great deal that a physician has to do. And this idea that somehow, that it's something that is natural, and because it's natural, it's okay, and the other thing that is somehow unnatural seems very distorted to me. Because --\", \"And let me just add that I have interviewed hundreds of people and heard stories of thousands more who wanted the option to be able to end their lives. And because they had to deal with the system in which what they were doing was illegal, they felt they had to do it while they still had enough vitality and enough self-control to take the lethal medications that they had been able to obtain. And they, over and over and over and over again, die months or sometimes years earlier than they would otherwise be going to die because they're afraid that they will lose that capacity. And my own mother said she could have lived longer if she hadn't been afraid that those intestinal tumors would make it impossible for her to ingest her --\", \"I'm arguing no such thing.  My question is whether --\", \"-- the doctor is injecting you.  It's a question of whether you'll get into a hospital within which you will not be able to exercise your own volition anymore, because the hospice system can be so controlling and you are so tightly monitored that you lose the capacity to take those drugs.\", 'Excuse me, but the only way to rectify that aspect of the healthcare system would be to give people the capacity to take those drugs under supervision of the healthcare system, which is precisely what you are opposing. [applause]', \"Well, that's actually been studied in the context of Oregon.  They've looked at the families of people who have had physician aid in dying and compared them on various psychological measures with families of people who died of natural causes.  And what they found is that there is no difference at all except that the people who had relatives who went through physician aid in dying by and large have a greater acceptance of what has happened and have a grieving process in which they feel there is more coherence. That's what the statistics in Oregon have shown.\", \"Well, I think it's terribly important that people have a psychological assessment.  When we proposed this, what we proposed is a highly regulated system.  And we have many highly regulated systems.  In fact, we have a highly regulated system for making a decision to discontinue life support.  We already have a system for people who don't want to go on living and who have a serious illness. That system in which people have to be shown to be competent, in which they have to be assessed not to be suffering from a psychiatric illness, in which, if there is any evidence that they might be, they have to undergo treatment before it's determined whether their decision is a fully rational decision is an appropriate set of measures.  But we set regulations like that everywhere.  I mean, 92 people a day die in traffic accidents in the United States.  We don't say, because people are dying in traffic accidents, we should make cars illegal.  We say people shouldn't drive over a certain speed limit.  They should pay attention to traffic lights.  We set a regulatory system in place.  And none of us are arguing in favor of an unregulated activity, and none of us are arguing in favor of helping people to die who have got a depression that could be calls to resolve.\", \"Well, I would start by saying that the situation in the Netherlands and what's been dealt with in that law is different from what's been dealt with here.  But, like Peter, I believe that there is room for improvement even in the laws that currently exist.  But in Oregon we have had 17 years of this law.  There has been no evidence of involuntary euthanasia.  There has been no evidence of physicians giving people who are disabled injections to terminate their lives.  The law is narrow and specific.  And it's that narrow and specific law that is in discussion here.  We live on a slippery slope.  We all live on a slippery slope.  There are many practices within our society that, taken to extreme, would be incredibly damaging and detrimental, and we contain them, and we can contain the damage in this and accomplish an enormous, enormous good.\", 'And I would just add that --', \"I will quickly.  First to say that I think we're all agreed that compassionate medical care is to the good and that anyone who can find meaning in life or can be helped to find meaning in life should be encouraged to do so and receive every possible support. But I -- [applause] Andrew Solomon: But I think, in keeping with what Peter has just said, that there are a great many people exploring a great many means to bring these ends to their lives.  There are people who are shooting themselves in houses by themselves because this is unavailable.  There are people who take this medication, someone I interviewed recently was the wife of someone who had managed to get medication and took it and vomited and knew he couldn't get another prescription and had to eat his vomit in order to ensure that he came to an end.  There is back alley euthanasia going on in various ways, and it is uncontrolled and unregulated.  And if it were legalized, it could be brought more into control.\", 'I take exception to the idea that all pain is treatable. It\\'s not true to clinical data and it\\'s not true to personal experience. And I also take exception to the idea that we value life by insisting that somebody -- to borrow your phrase \"not become a nobody.\" That can be care, but it can also be oppressive. Rilke wrote, \"We need, in love, to practice only this: letting each other go, for holding on comes naturally. We do not need to learn it. Death is not only the start of nothing, but also the end of everything. And it\\'s important that it keeps faith with the way that someone has lived. Nothing so resembles a person in his biography, as the manner of his or her death. The finale is what makes sense of the symphony. Simone de Beauvoir\\'s mother begged her for help when she was sick, and Simone de Beauvoir instead took the word of her doctors. And afterwards, she wrote, \"Beaten by the ethics of society, I had abjured my own. One is caught up in the wheels and dragged along, powerless in the face of specialist diagnoses that forecast their decisions. A race had begun between death and torture. I asked myself how one manages to go on living when someone you love has called out to you in vain? Let us not treat those we love with that pusillanimous disregard. Let us not institutionalize and enshrine in law prohibitions that force us to suffer contrary to our beliefs and force us to watch those we love suffer contrary to their expressed wishes.']\n",

      "['Elise Gould:', 'Nick Hanauer:']\n",
      "['Yes.', 'Well, not immediately, John, but we economists really know how to bring the facts to the table when we start bargaining over wages.', 'Yes, absolutely.', 'My partner is the charming and resourceful Nick Hanauer.', 'You can say it again. [laughter]', 'Thank you so much for inviting me to share my research and knowledge about the question at hand.  We are debating whether income inequality hampers the American dream of upward mobility.  And I\\'m here to tell you that it does.  Nick Hanauer and I hope to convince you that as income inequality has increased, the American Dream has been harder to achieve.  If we think -- as you\\'ve already heard already, the same analogy -- if we think of income distribution as rungs on the ladder, and upward mobility -- or mobility in general -- is movements up and down the ladder, common sense tells you if the rungs get further apart, the ladder is going to be harder to climb.  Let\\'s start with the first part of the proposition.  Research from a multitude of government and academic sources have indisputably found that income inequality has increased over the last generation.  That is an established fact. The tremendous growth in income inequality comes at a cost to individuals, to families, and to society as a whole.  We know from research that rising income inequality has not helped grow the size of the economy, and has likely even harmed growth.  This makes the rise in inequality a zero sum game at best.  Since inequality means that the larger shares are flowing to the top, middle, and bottom -- the middle and bottom continue to get squeezed.  Those consequences aside, the one cost we\\'re discussing today is reduced access to the American Dream.  The American Dream itself is a somewhat elusive concept.  It\\'s one of those you know it when you see it sort of things.  To some it means the happiness of a normal, stable life.  Not falling behind every year.  It means a good job and a great future for your children.  It means that if your kids work hard, they will find success.  Working hard is the backbone of the American Dream.  To know that your kids have the opportunity to do well, it is only for them to grab it, to seize the day. The most common concept economists use to measure upward mobility is intergenerational mobility.  This is the extent to which your parents\\' economic position determines your position in adulthood.  If your position on the earnings, income, or wealth scale is largely a function of your birth, then even the most talented coming from the lower rungs of society will have a hard time achieving success.  Conversely, little correlation between parents and children means that one\\'s economic fate can be directly determined through intelligence and hard work.  So how do we raise the economic mobility of the U.S.  today?  Well, one way is to look at how we compare to other countries.  Another way is to look at, historically, what has happened with mobility and discuss the pathways through which mobility is affected by opportunity. The fact that one\\'s economic position in childhood determines one\\'s position in adulthood more so in the U.S.  than in many advanced countries.  We have less mobility here than in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden. We have less mobility than Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Germany, Spain, France.  Let me talk for a moment about our peer to the north, Canada.  Canada actually looks a lot like us, both in economic regime and in its diversity.  But family background is twice as important in determining children\\'s success in the U.S.  than in Canada.  Furthermore, among our peers, we are the most unequal society, and we have seen the greatest growth in inequality.  Janet Yellen recently reiterated the fact that lower economic mobility is found in countries with higher income inequality.  So, the American dream is more likely elsewhere than here and more likely in more unequal societies.  Now, what\\'s happened over time?  The truth is that research on mobility has a few years before it can catch up to answer more definitively on this question.  We have to wait until the children born in the most unequal times, let\\'s say the last decade, until they grow up, and we can see, we can measure their incomes and their earnings. So far, high quality research has shown that economic mobility has been stagnant or declining over the last generation.  Even so, it\\'s impossible to know what the counter factual is.  Perhaps the society got richer, economic mobility would have increased.  So, finding stagnant mobility really doesn\\'t answer the question.  What is entirely clear and is known that income inequality leads to inequality of opportunity and resources, and this surely hampers mobility.  When growing inequality means that poor kids don\\'t get the proper nutrition they need or the glasses when they need them, then it\\'s obvious they can\\'t do as well in school.  Opportunity for many often looks like education.  Over time, high-income parents are -- are making increasingly larger and larger investments in their children.  And that\\'s a good thing.  But lower income families simply cannot afford to make those same investments. We\\'ve seen low income families increasing their investments from the 1970s to the 2000s, from about $835 per kid to about $1,300.  At the same time, over that same period, high income families\\' investments went from 3,500 to nearly $9,000.  And those investments pay off.  It may come as no surprise that more affluent students score better on standardized tests.  A recent study actually renamed the Scholastic Aptitude Test the Student Affluent Test.  Those with higher family income who tend to be college educated allow parents to live in neighborhoods with better schools and pay for private schools.  And it\\'s a self-reinforcing cycle.  This provides a direct link between growing inequality, growing gaps in opportunity and declining mobility.  Over this period of growing income inequality, college graduation rates have become increasingly unequal. Both groups, the top and the bottom, have seen higher college graduation rates than before.  But the bottom only increased by 4 percent while the top increased by almost 20 percentage points. What is even more troubling for society that defends the reality of the American dream is that low-scoring, high-income students are more likely to graduate from college than high-scoring, low-income students.  That is, by definition, not about ability.  It is about income.  Everyone can\\'t be in the top 1 percent.  And we can all name stories of children who did succeed against all odds.  But it\\'s \"against the all odds\" part that we\\'re here to talk about today.  Has living in an increasingly unequal society made it harder to climb the rungs of the ladder?  Unambiguously, the answer is yes.', \"Well, I think -- on the one hand, he's absolutely right, that the research is not conclusive, that mobility has declined.  There is some research from people at the Chicago Fed -- Male Speaker: [unintelligible]. [laughter] Elise Gould: That's right.\", \"But I think that the argument that we've seen growing income inequality happen over the last generation, over the last 30 years, income inequality has gotten worse. When we want to really measure this, we're kind of at a loss because we have to wait, we have to see what happens as those kids growing up in the most unequal times, what is going to happen with their outcomes, which is why I look at education, because that's what we can see today.  We can look at those opportunities that lead to a realization of the American dream, and those opportunities are simply not there, and not there to an increasing extent.\", \"I mean, what we've seen if we look -- as you said -- we should look at other advanced economies.  And I -- and as I said in my opening remarks, we have lower mobility than Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Japan, Spain, France -- a number of countries that are advanced economies.  And you brought up some research about Miles Corak.  And we're not going to debate Miles Corak this or Miles Corak that.  But the paper that I cited earlier, that family background is twice as important in determining children's success in the U.S.  as in Canada is also from a Miles Corak paper from this year.  And he finds pronounced stickiness, particularly at the top and the bottom of the distribution, meaning that kids from high income families are far more likely to be high income.  Kids from low income families are far more likely to be low income.  Less stickiness, so much in the middle. And I want to respond to one other thing that Ed said about transfers in resources.  One thing you said in your opening comments -- you mentioned helping the working poor. The idea that we have working poor in this country is -- I just -- I think it just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth, that we have people that are hardworking, working full-time -- maybe full-year -- and they can't lift their families out of poverty.  We absolutely need to think about --\", 'Yeah.', \"Well [unintelligible], lets just say the pie hasn't gotten bigger.  It hasn't gotten smaller from rising -- Male Speaker: It's gotten much bigger. Elise Gould: -- income inequality.  Let's say the pie stays the same size.  And if we know that a larger share of the pie is going to the top, that means that there's less there for everybody else.  When there's less there for everybody else, there's fewer resources going particularly to the bottom -- is what we're going to talk about here -- particularly at the bottom, there's fewer resources. And parents cannot afford to make those investments.  Children are living in far more stressful home environments.  Unemployment is more common.  There's less stable housing.  And all of those things provide a situation where children just do not have the same opportunities --\", 'Yes.  Thank you.', \"No, no, I'm going to --\", \"-- talk about what I'm planning on talking about today.\", \"You didn't feed me anything.  I'm not so sure about there being infinite slots in all the other schools, but that's another question. [applause] Elise Gould: And test prep is really far more available to the higher income, so that's not really where I want to go either.  I think the direction I want to go is inequality at the starting gate. And from that, I mean inequality at the beginning of kindergarten.  These differences are found very early on.  The differences in resources available to higher income children is far greater than available to lower income children.  As I said before, higher rates of unemployment, instability, lower income, all of those things absolutely come at a cost to kids.  And you see vast disparities, even the first day of kindergarten.  And schools do their best to try to maintain --\", 'Yep.', 'If --', \"Right.  I would argue that the growth in inequality has led to more poverty in this country as opposed to what the counter factual would be.  So if we had had, let's say from the late '50s to the mid '70s, we had economic growth that was associated with falling poverty rates.  If that relationship had continued, if, as the economy grew, we had broadly shared prosperity across the entire distribution, then we would have basically eradicated poverty by the 1980s.  So, this is absolutely a discussion about the size of the pie, not just the size of the pie, but the distribution of those resources of the pie.  And it's not just about the bottom. If we were to look at what happened to middle income families, and my research shows that if you were to look at sort of the wedge that's created by this growing inequality, that the typical family today would be making 18,000 more dollars in just one year. Those are substantial resources that American families could put a lot more energy into investments in their children.\", \"To answer your question, I think that Ed is maybe oversimplifying a little bit. We have seen employment growth and we haven't seen wage growth.  But we have a period in recent history -- in the late '90s -- when we saw strong wage growth.  We saw a tighter economy.  We saw higher employment.  We saw, arguably, full employment. And that meant that wages across the entire wage distribution actually rose.  And we saw that everywhere, and we actually saw stronger growth at the bottom than anywhere else.  And so, I think you can see higher employment.  You can also see higher wages.  It's not -- it's not -- I don't want to oversimplify that.\", \"I don't think customers decide. I think we're -- you know, we're talking about how we're splitting, how much of the profits come in, and we've seen record-high profits -- I don't think customers decided that CEO to the average worker pay should go from 30 to one 30 years ago to almost 300 to one today. [applause]\", \"Oh, that's a great -- [applause]\", 'Yes.', 'Yeah, to the second part of your question, yes, transfers, absolutely, if you take transfers into account, we can reduce poverty using transfers.  And we can show that with the data absolutely.  And Social Security is the number one way that we have transferred income to the elderly and reduced poverty among the elderly.  But I think that we want to do better.  I think we should look -- if we look at wage-based poverty rates -- if we look at wage-based poverty rates they have actually gone up.  So the rewards to hard work, and you talk about working long hours, the only reason why people at the bottom have seen any increase in their annual earnings is because of how many more hours those households are working, and they are working really hard to make ends meet. [applause]', \"Thank you.  One of the most profound pieces of research that I've encountered in my tenure as a professional economist came from an interdisciplinary group of researchers. They examined the brains of hundreds of young children from various economic backgrounds, beginning at birth and following them every few months until four years of age. And what they found is that children in poor families lagged behind the development of the frontal regions of the brain, deficits that help explain behavioral, learning, and attention problems more common among disadvantaged children.  What's striking is that the brains of the infants looked really similar.  You didn't see those differences at birth.  You start seeing the separation in brain growth between the children living in poverty and the more affluent children increase over time.  And that really implicates the environment in which they live.  It boiled down to an elevated fight or flight response from living in a more stressful home environment, which makes them less able to learn and succeed in school.  The researchers do note that these children are not doomed.  With the right investments, we can survive -- they can survive and contribute to society to the fullest extent.  Without that, they are really wasted resources.  It's no surprise that families economic situation and particularly low levels of economic stability can wreak havoc on children's wellbeing and their success later in life. While the mobility research has a few years to catch up as the children born in the most unequal times grow up -- the pathways are clear.  The evidence is there in black in white in those brain scans.  The truth is that income -- increasing incomes for those families at the bottom of the income distribution have extraordinary consequences for children's health, educational attainment, and future earnings.  It's not only well-founded, it's common sense.  If the economy had delivered jobs and growing wages to all those wanting to work and work hard, children across the income distribution would have a much better chance of succeeding and attaining the American Dream.  Luckily, there are steps we can take to reduce this trend, but let's not deny the facts.  Vote for increased opportunity.  Vote for the proposition.\"]\n",
      "[\"[laughs] Well, I live in Seattle, Washington, and I reckon you have to go all the way to Texas to find a serious and intelligent wealthy person who doesn't agree that rising inequality is something that we need to -- [laughter] -- that we need to address.\", \"Let me start tonight by sharing some IRS data. In 1980, the top 1 percent of Americans shared 8.46 percent of national income.  By 2007, it had risen to 22.86 percent.  During the same time, the bottom 50 percent of Americans' share of national income fell from 17.68 percent to 12.19.  During the same period, the income share of the top 1/10th of 1 percent of Americans rose to 12 percent, equaling the share of the bottom 50 percent of Americans combined.  And then in 2008 -- remember, 2007, before, those were the good old days -- things went really bad for the American middle class.  The distance an American child needs to go to get from the bottom to the top in our society is staggering. CEOs used to make 30 times the median wage now earn 300 to 500 times. If the IRS data that I just quoted you is not persuasive to you, does not persuade you that the distance from the top to the bottom is larger -- perhaps 10 times larger, then almost nothing Elise and I can say tonight will persuade you.  According to Scott, this economic inequality and its impact on mobility is a fiction.  The anguish felt by millions of ordinary working middle class Americans is a consequence of a misconception.  They are simply confused about the data.  Perhaps.  But there are two fundamentally different arguments inequality deniers make.  The first is that it doesn't exist.  The second is that it exists but it's actually really, really good for the economy and the middle class.  This argument is equally false, but at least it seems plausible.  The idea, of course, is that when the rich get richer, that's good for the economy and for the middle class, and for mobility. And anything we do to make the poor richer by definition harms the economy and mobility.  And this, of course, is the trickledown economics lie.  But Ed -- Ed and I do agree on one thing, and that is that innovation is essential to a growing economy and that capitalism needs some inequality to create incentives for people to innovate and to take risk.  The question for the house tonight is, is extreme inequality necessary, and should we have more and more of it every year?  Capitalism needs inequality to grow, just like plants need water to grow. But in precisely the same way that too much water kills plants by drowning them, too much income inequality kills capitalism by drowning the middle class.  Raging inequality is drowning the middle class and killing the American Dream of upward mobility. Ed and other inequality apologists present us with a false choice -- extreme and rising inequality is necessary to create adequate incentives for innovation and risk-taking, and that without these extreme incentives, it will all disappear.  He will tell you that anything we do to blunt inequality, like raising the taxes on the rich or improving labor standards for the poor, to increase wages -- will kill the economy and mobility.  This is utter nonsense.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Sam Walton -- they all started their companies when taxes were twice as high as they are today.  Theoretically, with half the incentive.  Did they make some sort of cosmic mistake?  Almost two years ago, taxes on capital gains went up 25 percent, theoretically quartering the incentive.  But from where I sit as a technology venture capitalist on the West Coast, the rate of innovation is increasing, not decreasing. Silicon Valley is more on fire, not less.  The stock market, since then, has gone from 12,000 to almost 17,000.  Clearly, people are responding to incentives, just not the ones Ed thinks.  The biggest incentive in a market economy is the market size.  And the more money most people have -- in other words, the less inequality we have -- the bigger the opportunity and the bigger the incentives are to invest and innovate.  Ed will tell you that the American economy has outperformed all others because of our extreme inequality.  If you are a partner at Bain or someone like me, that feels like it could be true, but it is not on a per capita basis.  Our economy has performed roughly the same, on a growth basis, as most other industrial countries.  1.7 to 1.9 percent.  The difference, of course, is what life is like for the typical family. Thirty years ago, the American middle class was undisputedly the most prosperous and mobile of any society.  Today, that is not true.  Today, by every measure, the -- the Canadian middle class is more prosperous than ours.  Ed and his trickle down ilk believe that capital is all that matters, but we are awash in capital.  American companies are currently sitting on $2 trillion worth of cash.  At the same time, the cost to innovate has fallen exponentially.  It took a million dollars to start Amazon.com.  In our economy, growth is dependent on how many innovators and consumers we include in the economy.  The economy isn't the bank accounts of the rich.  It is the dynamic feedback loop between sellers and buyers. This means that the more people we include in our economy as robust innovators and affluent consumers, the faster it grows and the bigger it gets.  But clearly and most obviously, high and growing rates of inequality don't help that.  They hinder it by excluding more and more people as sellers and buyers.  And at the end of the day, that's why rising inequality is terrible for the economy and for the American Dream of upward mobility.  When people are excluded by inequality, it destroys innovation.  It destroys consumption.  And it destroys mobility.  Rising inequality is literally drowning the middle class and killing the American Dream of upward mobility.  Thank you. [applause]\", 'I think --', \"Yeah, so just because the industrialized nations have not been radically unequal enough to allow economists to do timescale studies to prove that it will be harmful doesn't mean it's not.  And, in fact, if you look around the world, there are 205 countries running simultaneous experiments on how to create prosperous societies.  And in every single case where you find radical inequality you find low social economic mobility around the world, right?  This is not -- this is not a far-out concept.  There is very low economic mobility in highly unequal places in every place that you look.  And so, you know, the truth is that the United States has only been a highly unequal society for 10 to 20 years.  Thirty years ago it was not that bad. And so, the fact that you don't -- we haven't had the time to measure it doesn't tell you anything.  Your common sense, on the other hand, should inform you highly.\", \"Yeah.  I -- no.  No. [laughter] I mean -- look, I mean, you misunderstand our point.  I do not, for a moment, believe that the problem with the economy is that we have too much success and we should hinder it in some way. I simply believe that it seems obvious that the most successful should pay into the pot enough so that we can generate the increasing -- the virtual cycle of increasing returns if capitalism can be.  And there are a variety of things we have to do to close the inequality gap and to create more opportunity for people.  It's certainly not discouraging success.  But raising tax rates for private equity investors from the abomination of 15 percent to 39 does not discourage success.  It simply allows -- it creates enough money to begin to help people who are struggling in their daily lives to actually have opportunity, to have a decent education, to have a decent place to live, to put food on the table, to lead a somewhat normal life. You know, so these two things -- these are not -- we are not claiming that we need to eliminate success.  We need more success.  But the economy grows, the more successful people become.  It's not driven by a couple of people at the top like me and Ed.  It's driven by everyone else out there.  And that's the point -- that's the economy. It's the dynamic interaction of buyers and sellers, not the bank accounts of the rich.\", \"We're in violent agreement about that our economy benefits massively from very clever and very hard working people taking risks and innovating.  That's not the question.  The question is, should only a few percent of us be able to do that.  And the answer to that is categorically no.  I mean, look, here's the way to connect these two things.  Why are the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer?  Well, here's a reason, because over the last 40 years, the percent of profits that American corporations generate as a percentage of GDP, has gone from 6 to 12 percent. At the same time, the percent of GDP devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42.  So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually.  So that -- here's the thing you have to understand.  That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be.  It's profit because powerful people like me and Ed prefer it to be.  That trillion dollars could very easily be spent on wages. [applause] Or on discounts for consumers.  This isn't a consequence of some magical law of economics.  This is a consequence of differentials in power. And the thing is -- [applause] -- the thing is, is that if that trillion dollars was, instead of stuck in my bank account and Ed's bank account, but instead was coursing through the economy as wages and opportunity, we'd  have more innovators, we'd  have more risk-takers.  That's the beautiful thing about capitalism.  If you set it up right, it works super well.\", 'Yeah.  I would just like to add --', \"-- that, you know, the fundamental of capitalism is when workers have more money, businesses have more customers, and need more workers.  That's what -- why the role of policy is to solve the collective action system -- a collective action problem and push wages up for all workers, because when you do, it's good for business and for workers.\", \"Yeah.  So -- so transfers are a very small part of the solution here.  Requiring businesses to pay workers a living wage is not a transfer.  That's solving a collective action problem. Requiring businesses to pay middle class employees overtime is not a transfer.  It's a fairness and collective action problem. And there are all sorts of ways that everyone benefits when every business pays its workers more, including every business, right?  Because when every business pays its workers a decent wage, every business has more customers and every taxpayer is spared the expense of sending their tax dollars to the government to pay for the food stamps that low-wage workers require.  So it has less to do with transfers than other things.\", 'So quick audience poll with your hands, not the buttons:  Who thinks they work harder than their parents?', \"Two-thirds of the room.  Do you -- do you think you work harder than your parents because your tax rates are lower than theirs?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  So hard work is -- is an extremely important thing, but it is completely uncorrelated to the tax rates we pay.  That's the first point.  And the second thing is -- and this is the most difficult thing to talk about when we talk about upward mobility and the American dream and inequality.  And that is this:  That humans are status seeking creatures.  We are not optimizing for money.  We are optimizing for sort of social position. And when you go from a world where to fly first class is to be affluent, wealthy, to a world where you have to have a $25 million Falcon 2000 to be affluent, to live large, you have stretched the society apart in a way that means that 99.999 percent of the people in the society cannot live the good life.  And I would argue --\", \"I don't think that they will aspire one iota more in the second scenario than the first.  It's just that in the second scenario, 99.999 percent of you fail.  And I would argue that having a society that is an arms race, that is structured to be an arms race, that no one except me and maybe a couple other people in the audience, can possibly win, is a winning solution to building a good society.\", 'The poor people are working their tails off.', 'Let me address --', \"-- this CEO pay first.  So our companies are not more information based or more globalized than multinational big companies from around the world.  But the CEO pay in the United States, which expanded tenfold, that's not true in Norway.  It's not true in Australia.  It's not true in Canada.  It's not true in Germany or Japan. They did not need to do that in order to run their companies.  And I think that that's why, when you look at the mobility data, it's much higher in all of those places.\", 'Yeah, I don\\'t -- I don\\'t think that\\'s a fair way of characterizing it, that the extra trillion dollars is profit because corporations have more power today than workers. It once wasn\\'t true.  We had unions, and we had even better labor standards than we have today, and those have eroded.  Again, the only difference, it\\'s not an economic difference, it\\'s simply a power difference.  And the question becomes, \"What kind of a country do you want to have?  Do you want to have a country where a few people earn everything and most people earn nothing or do you want to have a country where most people do pretty well and everybody lives a life that includes upward mobility?  And my argument is that we generally should prefer the latter, and that is within the scope of our choice we can do that by using policy and politics to advance a commonsense agenda.', 'Thank you.  Scott, I acknowledge that in some ways, economic inequality and mobility may not be as bad as some of the data suggests.  But I equally insist that in many ways, it is likely far worse than the data shows.  And Ed, people do, of course, need theoretical incentives.  But even more, they need practical opportunity.  For all of human history, wherever you have found concentrated wealth, you find its defenders and its apologists, the deniers.  The people who put lead in paint denied it was harmful.  The people who made cigarettes denied they gave us cancer.  The fossil fuel industry today denies global warming. The packaged food industry denies that sugary soft drinks have anything to do with our epidemic of childhood obesity and diabetes, and how could we not have inequality deniers?  Like clockwork, they will tell you it\\'s not happening, or if it is, it\\'s really, really good for the economy and for the middle class in mobility.  Inequality tonight is being sold like high fructose corn syrup.  \"Yummy.  Have some more.\" Really?  Really?  So, we should ignore the facts and the drowning feeling a majority of middle income Americans are experiencing today, as they watch the American Dream recede?  Our answer to them to be -- should -- our answer to them should be, \"Hey, you just need to look at the data differently.  We should believe that the young men in Ferguson, Missouri elected not to become software engineers or partners at Bain because the theoretical incentives to take risk were not high enough.\" Elise and I do not believe that, and we hope that you don\\'t either.  You don\\'t need a PhD in economics to see that extreme and rising inequality isn\\'t just impairing the American dream of upward mobility.  Inequality is drowning it.']\n",

      "[\"No, we're still Verizon customers.  And I don't think we'd escape the NSA that easily. But it's one of the reasons why we had a minor cause to celebrate at the ACLU, because we could finally prove the NSA is collecting our records, which was allowing us to have our day in court.\", \"I didn't say that. [laughter]\", \"I'm joined by the illustrious Supreme Court and Constitutional Law Expert, Elizabeth Wydra.\", 'Thank you, John.  I\\'m honored to be here tonight to discuss the mass collection of Americans\\' phone records.  But before I get into the program, I think it\\'s critical to recognize that tonight\\'s debate is not just about phone records and is not just about the NSA.  This is a debate about the kind of society we want to live in.  Do we want to live in a country in which our government routinely spies on hundreds of millions of Americans who have done nothing wrong?  Or do we prefer to live in a country that\\'s true to our vision, to the vision of our nation\\'s founders, who believe that the government should, as a general matter, leave us alone unless it has cause to invade our privacy?  I think our founders got it right, and I hope you\\'ll agree, which is why you should vote for the resolution, mass collection of our phone records violates the fourth amendment.  Here is what it looks like to live in a society of mass surveillance.  Every time you place or receive a call the government knows who you talked to, when the call started and how long it lasted. The government knows every time you called your doctor and which doctor you called, which family members you stay in touch with and which you don\\'t, and which pastor, rabbi or imam you talked to and for how long you spoke.  The government knows whether, how often and precisely when you called the abortion clinic, the local Alcoholics Anonymous, your psychiatrist, your ex-boyfriend, a criminal defense attorney or the suicide hotline.  If you called someone today, by tomorrow morning, the government will have a record of that call.  It will keep that record for the next five years.  And it is doing the same for every one of your calls and every one of the calls of millions of other innocent Americans.  This program is the most sweeping surveillance operation ever undertaken in the United States.  And it is unconstitutional for the simple reason that the Fourth Amendment does not allow dragnet surveillance.  As my partner, Elizabeth, will explain in a few minutes, dragnet surveillance in fact was the principal evil that the Fourth Amendment was designed to prevent, and for good reason.  Dragnet surveillance intrudes on the most fundamental of liberties in a free and democratic society: to be left alone by our government, absent good cause. The phone records program breaks that promise.  It places the entire country under surveillance without any suspicion.  It threatens our ability to communicate freely without having to worry that the government is looking over our shoulders.  It discourages journalists sources from coming forward, knowing as they now do that every -- every one of their calls is being documented in a government database.  And it causes ordinary Americans to hesitate before calling individuals or organizations that they would rather not have as a part of their permanent record on file with the NSA. Now, our opponents will attempt to minimize the NSA program\\'s intrusiveness and exaggerate its effectiveness.  They\\'ll argue that the Fourth Amendment does not protect our phone records, that there are protections in place for our privacy under the program and that the program is necessary for our national security.  All of those arguments are wrong.  First, our phone records, especially when they\\'re collected in bulk, are extraordinarily sensitive.  They reveal all of your associations, personal, professional, medical, all of them. In fact, your phone records can be every bit as sensitive as the content of your phone calls.  If you call someone other than your spouse routinely at 1:00 in the morning, you don\\'t have to know what\\'s said in order to know what\\'s going on.  And if a government employee calls a reporter a dozen times before news breaks of an illegal government operation, again, the call pattern tells the story.  Our phone records are, in other words, a proxy for the content of our calls.  Our opponents will say that the Supreme Court has already decided that phone records are not protected by the Constitution.  This argument is based on a Supreme Court case from 1979 called Smith vs.  Maryland.  But that case involved collection for several days of an individual criminal suspect\\'s phone records.  The NSA\\'s program, in contrast, involves the indefinite surveillance of millions of innocent Americans.  Our opponents will say that these differences don\\'t matter. But it\\'s truly bizarre to define the boundaries of privacy in the digital age on the basis of a legal opinion issued before the internet as we know it was created, an opinion that many Supreme Court justices have already said is ill suited to the digital era.  Second, the privacy protections that our opponents will focus on are a red herring.  Those restrictions are weak.  They can be violated, and they already have been thousands of times.  But more importantly, under our opponents\\' theory, the Constitution simply does not apply to our phone records.  This means that the government could collect them without any of the supposed privacy protections that they will describe.  Another fatal flaw in this argument is that the government\\'s collection of our phone records violates our privacy even if there are restrictions in place for their later use.  The collection itself is a violation.  For that reason, we don\\'t let the NSA keep a copy of every single email sent in the country so long as there are protections in place on the back end.  And we don\\'t allow the NSA to put a video camera in our bedrooms so long as it promises not to press play unless it has a good enough reason.  Third, bulk collection has not made us any safer. Virtually every independent review of the NSA\\'s phone records program has concluded that it hadn\\'t stopped any terrorist attacks and that the government can track down terrorists without bulk collection by issuing targeted requests to the phone companies. A congressional review group said this:  That after studying the NSA\\'s classified evidence, it could not, quote, \"Identify a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the telephone records program made a concrete difference.\"  A separate presidential group came to the same conclusion, and the president himself has now agreed.  One final point:  Tonight\\'s resolution is focused on phone records.  But don\\'t be fooled.  The consequences are much, much broader.  If the Fourth Amendment permits the bulk collection of our phone records, then it would permit the bulk collection of other similar records.  The problem is that virtually everything we do today leaves a digital trail of some sort.  Whenever you send an email, visit a website, use your credit card or even just walk around with your phone turned on, you are leaving a rich trail of digital bread crumbs in your wake.  The arguments our opponents will make tonight would expose all of that information to routine, bulk collection by the government. That\\'s not the world that our framers envisioned when they drafted the Fourth Amendment, and it\\'s not the world that you should accept.  You should vote for the motion, the mass collection of our phone records violates the Fourth Amendment. Thank you.', \"I think that reflects a pre-digital understanding of our privacy, and I think that's one of the fundamental problems with our opponents' position is that they ask a very simplistic question that may have made sense in the 1960s and 1970s but doesn't make any sense today where the vast majority of our communications have to be shared with an intermediary, not because we're voluntarily giving the information over to AT&T or not because we're voluntarily giving it over to Yahoo or Microsoft or Gmail, but because we have to in order to use those communication systems. And I think it would be -- it would undermine the security of all those systems and undermine our right to privacy to say very simplistically that this doctrine, this notion of sharing, is an on/off switch.  That is never how our judges have applied it.  It's not how the Supreme Court has applied it.  And if you look at recent cases, you're seeing the Supreme Court struggling with how to update privacy law to account for this dramatic change in technology.  And --\", \"I think that's part of the change.  The other part of the change before -- and if I can say before answering your question -- is that it is now not really possible to meaningfully participate in society without using the communications platforms that all of the tech companies have brought to us.  And so, it's necessary to, as Stewart would say, share this information. But it's not of that same voluntary nature that I think our opponents rely on.\", \"I think that's right.  Yeah.  Can I respond to one thing that Stewart just said?\", \"And something that, Professor Yoo said as well, which is that we shouldn't trust courts to safeguard our individual rights.  And I think that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding about what the Bill of Rights is about.  The Bill of Rights was designed to withdraw from political the majorities the decisions that affect the individual rights of people who can't protect themselves through political constituencies.  It was precisely for that purpose that the Constitution and our framers placed those decisions in unelected, tenure-protected judges so that they could safeguard individual rights. And so I think the wrong answer is to say we should leave our individual rights to Congress, particularly this Congress or the next.\", \"I think that's a narrow way of viewing the Constitution, but it's not particularly surprising that professor Yoo makes that argument.  You know, professor Yoo made the same argument with respect to the fact that war time authority trumped individual protection against torture.  And I think that's a wrong way of viewing the Constitution.\", 'We can discuss that another time.  But in any event, the question of whether --', \"I'll withdraw that.  I apologize.\", 'Sure.', \"So, I think the Constitution protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures.  And the initial question that you need to ask is whether it is ever reasonable for the government to engage in bulk collection.  And the problem with going down that route is we would end up in a society that the framers could not possibly have envisioned which is that the government would always, for good purpose, it would say, collect vast quantities of information about people who've done absolutely nothing wrong.  But even if you think that's an acceptable way of thinking about the Constitution, the problem with our opponents' arguments is that two separate review groups, both with access to classified evidence, who've now reviewed the case that they're relying on to suggest that this program is necessary, have concluded that it simply isn't necessary. That the government could have accomplished its interest through the targeted use of surveillance orders to these companies or to other companies.\", \"No, I don't think I would.  Everyone to have reviewed the way that the NSA should go about its business says it should go about it in a targeted way.  And that the key to protecting the country is not through suspicionless surveillance of everyone, but through very targeted efforts directed at those who are doing us harm.  I think that's the lesson of the two review groups who reviewed this program.  That's the conclusion that the president himself has come to.  I think that's what's also consistent with our Constitutional values.\", \"I think when you're talking about bulk collection, yes.\", \"Yeah, I think, again, one of the easiest responses is simply that this issue has been analyzed by two bipartisan groups of individuals who concluded that we can engage in targeted collection of information to solve these problems.  You know, one of the repeated hypotheticals has come from Stewart about the Safe House in Yemen.  And in that particular example, which was the pre-9/11 one that NSA supporters have used as the best example for why they need this program. Both -- or maybe it was just one of the commissions.  But one of the commissions very carefully studied that particular example.  And they decided that it would have been very easy for the government to have used targeted surveillance requests to uncover the link between the Safe House in Yemen and the parties on the U.S.  end because they had the phone number of the Safe House.  Indeed, they had to have the phone number because that's the only way they knew about the Safe House.  And they could have taken that phone number and gone to the three major telecoms in the United States and served them with this order.  And they would have very quickly uncovered the existence of the Safe House.  That's what the commission concluded.  And I think the same is likely true for burner phones.\", \"I think it's wrong to say that our courts are not grappling the question of whether Smith V.  Maryland remains relevant today.  Not too long ago, a Court of Appeals said that our email is protected by the Constitution, even though we have to share it with Gmail. That's a very common-sense conclusion, but it's one that our opponents would apparently resolve by saying email is not protected because it's stored on the servers of a third party. And more recently, the Supreme Court has said, five justices have said, in various opinions, that Smith vs.  Maryland may not make sense in the digital era.  And it's quite obvious why, because if that were the law of the land, then virtually everything we do today, which is reduced to a digital trail, would be susceptible to bulk collection by the government.\", 'I would just amend Professor Yoo\\'s response on the legal question in just one way. The Supreme Court has said that \"reasonableness\" means -- is in general a balance, except when the government can accomplish its interests in a targeted way.  And in that context, the Supreme Court has always said that the government must proceed with a warrant based upon probable cause.  If the government can accomplish its interests in that targeted way, it must.  And that\\'s not perhaps surprising.  That\\'s been our Constitutional tradition since -- since the late 1700s, and it should continue to do so today.', \"Thanks, John.  I want to take a slightly different tack.  So, in 1981, it cost around $300,000 to store a gigabyte of data.  By 2010, just a couple years ago, that cost had plummeted to about 10 cents.  And by next year, some people estimate it'll be about 2 cents to store a gigabyte of data.  And just to give you a sense of what that means for surveillance, it means that you could store the entire audio from every single phone call that a single person has made over the course of an entire year for about 10 cents.  And by next year, it'll be about 2 cents. That result of that plummeting cost of storage is that for the first time in our nation's history, truly pervasive surveillance is possible.  It'll be possible for the government to store not just -- not -- to keep track of not just who you email, who you call and what websites you visit.  They'll be able to make a copy of every email you send, to record every phone call you make, to archive every website that you visit.  And the cost has fallen so much and so dramatically that it will soon even be possible for the government to record virtually every step you take once you leave the house.  This is not science fiction.  This is a predictable result of falling storage and the proliferation of these types of surveillance devices on military fields now coming home to return to us to local law enforcement.  I think that's why this debate, tonight's debate on mass collection of phone records, is about so much more than phone records and so much more than the NSA.  If our opponents are correct, it won't end with the NSA.  It won't end with the FBI, and it won't end with even local law enforcement.  Mass collection will be the norm. So, the choice you have is whether you want to live in a free society or one in which our every movement and our every communication is tracked, recorded and stored in a database.  In the past, cost was the main protection we had against that sort of world. But cost is no longer an issue.  The Fourth Amendment is all we have left.  And that's why I think you should vote for the motion that mass collection violates the Fourth Amendment.\"]\n",
      "[\"Oh, yes.  I think it's fabulous.  You know, I don't know if it's because I was christened on the 4th of July in a bicentennial year or maybe my mother read a lot of American history while she was pregnant with me, but since birth, I've always been very inspired by the work of those framer guys.\", \"I know, right?  I'm a lucky girl.\", \"Thank you so much.  Thank you so much, John.  It's great to be here tonight.  Now, Stewart certainly presents a frightening picture of terrorists working here in the United States.  But he presents a false choice between the idea of securing our nation and remaining faithful to the fundamental values that our nation holds dear, as expressed in the Constitution and, relevant to tonight, the Fourth Amendment.  We can do both.  As my partner Alex has ably explained, the NSA has not established that its massive intrusion into the lives of everyday Americans is necessary in order to keep us safe.  But while this dragnet surveillance program has not been established as necessary, the importance of protecting against such suspicionless, sweeping searches, as those conducted by the NSA, is established in our Constitutional tradition beyond question. Intrusive searches like the one being conducted every day by the NSA strikes at the very core of what the Fourth Amendment was enacted to prevent.  It gets to the very heart of why our nation's founders were willing to lay down their lives if they had to in order to protect the liberty, security, and personal privacy of Americans.  So, as you listen to our debate tonight, I would ask you to keep in mind the vision and the values of our founders.  The reasons why they wrote into our Constitution the Fourth Amendment in the first place -- keep that as your North Star tonight.  When the founding fathers drafted the Fourth Amendment, the mischief to which they were responding was principally the British use of general warrants and writs of assistance. Broadly authorized searches that allowed British officers to go into the homes of American colonists without any particularized suspicion of wrongdoing.  And they were used broadly in the hope that if they went through enough people's stuff, they would find something that would show evidence of wrongdoing.  Now, that sounds a little familiar to me today.  These generalized searches back then were decried as instruments of arbitrary power.  They were used to silence critics of the crown and to trample the personal liberty of the American colonists.  In fact, American colonists' opposition to these sorts of generalized searches was, as Chief Justice Roberts explained in a recent Supreme Court decision on behalf of all nine justices on the court, applying robust Fourth Amendment protections to the searches of cell phones, the opposition to these sorts of warrantless, generalized searches was one of the driving forces behind the Revolution itself. To illustrate, the Chief Justice recounted a famous speech given in 1760s Boston by the patriot James Otis, denouncing the use of warrantless searches, generalized searches without individualized suspicion, that invaded American colonists privacy without probable cause.  One young man listening in the audience that day was none other than John Adams.  And recounting Otis's speech and the day, Adams described it later as, the first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the child independence was born.  The need to get a warrant to have reasonable suspicion before invading someone's privacy, that wasn't a mere technicality, something on a checklist that you have to go through that slows down good law enforcement, something that the guys on Law and Order sort of get past with a wink and a nod. It was something that was so important to our founders that it was an essential part of the struggle for independence.  We are no longer in that first act of the great American story, and we are fortunate that we have to guide us today the wisdom and the words of the Constitution.  James Otis in the 1760s didn't have the Fourth Amendment to back up his arguments, but fortunately, Alex and I do tonight.  The text of the Fourth Amendment, which you've seen on the screens, declares the right of the people to be free from unreasonable searches.  And it tells the government that it needs to have probable cause before it wants to invade our privacy.  The detailed text enshrines a specific prohibition, something that's rather unusual in the Constitution, which often speaks in broader terms, a specific prohibition against the types of suspicion-less searches that the NSA is conducting every day on Americans -- sweeping searches and surveillance of very private information without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. And the wisdom of our founders applies just as much today as it did in the 18th century. I think those framer guys still have a lot to tell us about what kind of society we want to live in, as Alex said.  Just because the sensitive private information that we hold -- that we hold dear today can be gleaned remotely and electronically rather than having a British red coat break the padlock on our leather trunk and our cute brick colonial in Boston, as Chief Justice Roberts said, that does not make that information any less worthy of the protection that the founders fought for.  Now, the other side will try to say that there isnt a search or there is some exception that makes it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  But I would submit that any exception to the Fourth Amendment that allows the government to collect data that can reveal sensitive, deeply private information about every American citizen without any suspicion that we are engaged in real wrongdoing. Any exception to the amendment that allows that would swallow this most important protection in the Constitution, something that was so important to our founders that it breathed a spark to the fire of revolution.  So, if you keep as your north star those founders, I trust that you will vote for the proposition that mass collection of Americans' private records violates the Fourth Amendment.  Thank you.\", \"Well, you know, John mentioned in his remarks, he said that he didn't want to leave these decisions to, you know, five old guys on the Supreme Court. But I'm sorry to say that you're behind the times of nine justices on the Supreme Court, however old they are, because just a few months ago at the end of last term, a unanimous Supreme Court told us that digital is different in a case that applied the Fourth Amendment to Smartphones.\", \"Well, you know, I think there's a great analogy that Chief Justice Roberts used.  He said that, Saying that a ride on a horse and buggy is the same as taking a rocket ship to the moon makes about as much sense as using some of these old precedents and rules when applied to the digital age, because the type, the quantity, and quality of information that can be gained in the digital age is just so different that it actually makes a real difference to the Fourth Amendment.\", \"So before, when you would have this information that was available to the public, it was sort of a random tile that could give you a very small glimpse into a person's life. But because of the quantity of data that can be accessed very easily -- this came up in a case about GPS locators -- it adds up to a mosaic that provides a rather clear picture of a person's life in a way that you couldn't in a pre-digital age.\", 'With a semicolon, maybe.', \"We know she's here.  We don't want to get in trouble.\", \"Well, that would be relevant if we were making a claim under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, but instead we have a specific text in the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits these types of searches. So that's what's violated, not equal treatment under --\", '[unintelligible] mom.', \"Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, especially when you bring up a lot of these very frightening scenarios, I think it's important to remember that, as Alex pointed out earlier, these bipartisan commissions that have access to the classified data have not found that this bulk data collection has led to the prevention of an imminent attack. You know, I think I might take a slightly softer position than Alex on this in the sense that the Fourth Amendment doctrine does allow for exigent circumstances, exceptions to a warrant requirement, and that's -- but that's very, very narrowly circumscribed.\", \"I don't think we're in that now, and I don't think that bipartisan commissions that have access to classified information think that we're in that position now.\", \"Yeah.  You know, we have already made this decision.  We the people ratify the Fourth Amendment.  And so, I think that to make it seem like that's still in play just disregards the Constitution.  But I, you know, I want to make a point about law enforcement.  And, you know, the Fourth Amendment does not yield to concerns of efficiency.  The Supreme Court very clearly stated this just at the end of its last term when it said that, If the police want to search a Smartphone when it's arresting someone, that would be a great way to find really good evidence. And, in fact, they did in those cases. They have, you know, pictures of this guy with guns in front of a car that used in a shooting.  But the court said that privacy comes at a cost.  And when that cost is efficiency, that must yield to the concerns of the Fourth Amendment.  So, you know, these Justices understand technology.  They have clerks.  And they have said that digital is different when it comes to the Fourth Amendment, and that the Fourth Amendment doesn't just yield to make things easier for law enforcement in all circumstances.\", \"Thank you so much, John.  So I think it's important to think about what we haven't heard tonight.  We haven't heard any solid case for why the government needs to engage in this mass collection of Americans' phone records, going on every day.  As Alex said, if you make a call tonight, the NSA will know about it and have it recorded tomorrow.  They haven't shown that there is the need to engage in this dragnet surveillance that offends the principles of the Constitution, to thwart an imminent attack.  And while we have talked a lot about some of these very disturbing scenarios of terrorist activity, I think that getting back to one of the questions earlier, it is in these times of crisis, it is in those times, as well as in the easy times, that our principles and our devotion to our founding principles are tested. And we the people have already determined that the question of whether or not the people shall be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures is not up for debate.  It is something that is enforceable in our courts, and it's something that we the people have decided upon many, many years ago.  And in closing, I just want to get to this very odd idea which we didn't explore any more, about somehow that it's okay that the government just collects the information and it's not really problematic for the Constitution if they don't actually look at it.  Well, I want you to think about this before you vote again.  You know, if the government stationed a person to stand next to your bathtub every time you took a bath, do you think your privacy isn't invaded if the government agent stands there with his hands over his eyes the whole time?  I'm going to think that you're going to think things have gotten a lot less private up in there before he looks when you're taking your bath. So, I think we need to think about the collection of this information is just as bad as if they actually looked at the content and not just the fact that they take this information in the first place reveals a lot of data and personal information about us in general.\"]\n",

      "['Baker -- Baker was one smart guy.  He had no idea just how right he was.', 'Paul Pillar.', \"John, thank you very much.  It's an honor and privilege to be here.  It's an honor to debate Mike and Bret, friendly but formidable opponents, and it's wonderful to be here with Paul Pillar who brings a measure of honesty and clarity to this debate, sometimes controversial, but it is sorely needed.  I really do find myself, unfortunately, sadly, paradoxically, in the anomalous position of agreeing with almost everything Bret said. And at the risk of never being invited back to IQ2 -- [laughter] -- I have to say at the outset that this is a national conversation that is simply too important to be constrained and confined to simple propositions.  I will defend the proposition, but the nuance is clear.  And Bret made the case, and that is to say there is smart muscle flexing -- the effective application, formidable application of American military power -- and there is dumb muscle flexing.  And that anomaly, that inconsistency, has to be reflected not just in the debate but in the actual execution of policy.  If the application of American military power had always been smart, we wouldn't be having these conversations, and I'd be applauding Michael and Bret for everything that they've said in their compelling arguments, nor would I have ever agreed to debate and argue for the proposition. But sadly, that has not been the case.  Muscle flexing has, on balance, in my judgment, as my inestimable partner, Paul Pillar, has mentioned, it's messy, and it's, for the United States, been on balance a very unhappy enterprise.  And it is likely to remain unhappy as well.  This is not to say -- and I want to repeat this for my own personal credibility and what remains of my professional reputation -- [laughter] The reality is that the application of military power can be effective, can be appropriate. Bush 41, for whom I worked, pushing Saddam out of Kuwait. Go read Baker's memoir of why Bush didn't continue that operation to Baghdad.  Read Baker's prescient memoir about the risks, the limitations, and the constraints.  Bush 43's application of military power in Afghanistan, air power, local allies, good intel, managed in a manner of months to defeat al-Qaeda and to decimate the Taliban, at least for the moment. But in recent years, I would argue to you, respectfully and humbly, we have not been nearly as effective as in years past.  In fact, I would argue that the U.S.  is like some modern-day Gulliver, wandering around in a part of the world that it does not understand, constrained by its own illusions, by smaller powers whose interests are not its own all the time.  And in search of Hollywood endings to a region that is broken, angry, and dysfunctional, and offers up not solutions and definitive outcomes at all, but just outcomes.  And do not let our debating opponents try to persuade you that this is a Republican issue or a Democratic issue.  I worked for Rs and Ds.  I voted for Rs and Ds. And I can tell you, with some authority, that muscle flexing, dumb muscle flexing, is a bipartisan -- [laughter] -- as well as equal opportunity employer. Twain quipped, and he was right, famously, that history does not repeat -- it does not repeat.  History rhymes.  And it's the rhythmic patterns that you need to pay attention to when it comes to smart application of American military power.  Let me identify four, perhaps five, cautionary tales with respect to why you need to support our rendition of this emotion -- of this motion.  Number one: There is muscle flexing as overreach.  Paul has referred to Iraq, what I call -- not to trivialize the men and women who served, who died, and who suffered life-crippling injuries from which they will never, ever recover. This turned out to be, in my judgment, with all due respect, a trillion dollar social science experiment that fundamentally failed. It caused 6,000 Americans dead, trillions expended, most of our credibility in tatters. And for what?  A standard of victory was not, could we win, but when could we leave? And extrication is not a metric that you want to use to judge the performance of the most consequential power on earth.  That's muscle flexing as overreach.  Then you have muscle flexing as bluster.  That is to say, talk without action.  And I would argue, even though I have supported the president's willful refusal to militarize the American role in Syria in order to defeat Assad -- ISIS is a different story now -- that was an example of talk without action.  That is dumb muscle flexing because it erodes and undermines credibility.  Presidential rhetoric has to be rooted in reality.  If you say it, you've got to mean it, and you have to follow through.  Then we have what I call one-off muscle flexing.  That's Libya. That's where we and NATO took eight months to take care of Colonel Q, but without much regard or thought to the implications of what would come next.  And we lost the first sitting ambassador since 1979, Chris Stevens, as a consequence.  Fourth, there is split-the-difference muscle flexing.  I support the president's strategy in Syria, but it is replete with anomalies and contradiction that are going to be extremely difficult to maintain.  We strike ISIS, we essentially empower Assad.  We try to take out Assad, we leave the field open to ISIS.  Caliphates in Damascus, with Baghdad next.  And fifth -- and this is why this is deadly serious.  What is happening tonight, this conversation is not some sort of academic exercise.  The mother of all military interventions may be not far away. If negotiations do not produce a comprehensive accord, if sanctions do not work with respect to the mullahs in Tehran, if the mullahs accelerate their program, this president has set his own red line.  He will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.  We have committed ourselves to the Israelis repeatedly over the last several years not to preempt, we will do it for them.  So I urge you when you vote, think about the consequences and implications, both for and against, of the application of military power.  Let me conclude by simply saying neither this administration that has been risk averse or the last one that has been too risk ready has got it right.  The next time we apply military force, we need to think through how, why, and where.\", \"Again, we're constrained and confined by a motion that is, in many respects, really not appropriate to the national conversation that has to be had.  This president, frankly, is risk averse, except in one area where he has emerged to be George W.  Bush on steroids.  And that is the protection -- that is the protection of the continental United States. He's killed ten times the number of, however you want to describe them, terrorists, militants, extremists, with predator drones.  He's expanded the drone war to Pakistan, to Yemen, to Somalia.  He killed Bin Laden.  He dismantled al-Qaeda core.\", \"What I'm saying is the reason he interceded several weeks ago is because the organizing principle of the nation's foreign policy is the protection of the homeland.  9/11 was the second bloodiest day in American history, exceeded by only one other day, September 17th, 1862, when more Americans were killed in a single afternoon in the battle of Antietam, than any other day.  That is the organizing principle.  That's why public opinion, frankly, has become risk ready, not because we believe, or the president believes, that he is somehow going to put the Iraqi and Syrian Humpty Dumpty back together again.\", \"He can't.\", \"No, Bret, that's unfair.\", 'May I just try to frame this -- look, we are stuck in a region we cannot transform, and we cannot extricate ourselves from.  We have interests, allies and enemies there.  When you cannot transform, and you cannot extricate, that leaves only one course, which is, I would argue, my word, you transact.  You essentially apply a cruel and unforgiving standard to what constitutes American national interests, and you willfully pursue those interests.  You decide what\\'s doable from what isn\\'t, what is vital from what is discretionary. And when I say, \"vital,\" what do I mean by \"vital\"?  I mean an enterprise in which we are prepared to expend American lives, American treasure and American credibility.  That leads you back to the one thing most Americans do care about, and that is the protection of the continental United States, which was --', \"-- in effect was the basis for Obama's intervention.\", \"We've spent the -- and, again, I haven't seen a piece of classified information since 2003, so what I'm about to say is my view -- we've spent the last several years trying to preempt the Israelis from striking Iran prematurely. On the assumption that negotiations and or sanctions, some combination of the two would retard, ultimately undermine Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapons capacity -- forget the weapon itself, just the threshold capacity -- we've make commitments to the Israelis based on the assumption that if they stay their hand and Iran moves to weaponize, we will do this because we can do it better, we can do it more comprehensively and more definitively.  This president may well be called on, Bret, to make good on that.  And this is an issue for 2015 if these negotiations don't reach an agreement in November, which is highly unlikely in my view.\", \"Two things would undermine and destroy the Obama presidency, what remains of Obama's credibility.  One is another consequential attack on the homeland -- I'm not talking about a lone wolf inspired attack, I'm talking about directed attack that leads to scores of American casualties, regardless of his actions now -- and the second, which three administrations have now committed themselves to, is Iran's crossing the threshold to weaponize -- Michael doran: Which is -- and he agrees with you.  He agrees with you.  And that's why he is caving in the negotiations.  And -- Aaron David Miller: Well, look, I'm not here to --\", 'This one may not have a Hollywood ending.', 'Can I just add one point?  ISIS is a response to two failed and/or failing states and a pool of Sunni grievances which mount faster than the numbers of moderate Sunni rebels that we can stand up -- grievances generated by Assad and grievances generated by Maliki. Male Speaker: Precisely.  Precisely. Aaron David Miller: You are receiving some [unintelligible] that we could fix that?', \"Sure. [laughter] You're assuming somehow we had the power, the incentive, the motivation after the two longest wars in American history to basically put the Syrian Humpty Dumpty and Iraq back together again?  That's your assumption? Do you think that would --?\", 'No, but Bret --', \"To the extent we enabled the weakness of Iraq and Syria, Bret has a point.  But I do not believe we bear the primary responsibility for ISIS' emergence.  It was Larry Summers who said, In the history of the world, nobody ever washed a rental car. You know why you don't wash rental cars?  Because you care only about what you own.  And the problem in this region is a lack of ownership.  It's a lack of gender equality.  It's a lack of transparency, accountability, pluralism, and the emergence of national leaders who care about the vast majority of their people.\", 'That helped ISIS --', 'To the extent -- yeah.  To the extent we enabled it, we deserve a responsibility.', 'Well, that point may be true, but you --', 'I mean, I think --', \"It's the Goldilocks approach, which I happen to support.  It's trying to find a balance between risk readiness and risk aversion, an effort -- first of all, we already had boots on the ground, especially operators in Iraq.  And I suspect, over the next year and a half, that number could double and triple.  You should also not be surprised to learn one day that in effect, we already have boots on the ground in Syria, and we will have additional boots on the ground, but not the massive redeployment of thousands of American combat forces.  That's one red line that will not turn pink with respect to this particular president.  The campaign is effective for undermining, retarding, preempting, keeping ISIS, Nusra, Khorasan on the defensive. If we hit them repeatedly, they'll have less time to spend planning attacks.  But if you asked anybody from the CIA today, what is the most imminent threat to the continental United States right now?  They won't say, ISIS.  They won't say Iran.  They'll say AQAP.\", 'Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.', 'Well, you know, the notions --', '-- the notions that we can have a cookie cutter strategy that is applicable to any number of situations in a region that is so fundamentally complex in my judgment is simply not possible.', \"No, no, no, but you're asking for a sort of Rx, a prescription for how to force smaller --\", \"I think that as long as you calculate means and ends, and that, in effect, military power, the projection of it, is an instrument to serve a set of political goals -- then military power can be an effective tool.  What do you do, however, in a situation like Egypt where, in effect, they are an ally -- former ally -- still our ally.  We have a freedom agenda.  We want to promote democracy in a country that is, since the overthrow of Mubarak, has been dominated by a struggle between the military in one hand and the Islamists on the other.  We have interests in Egypt.  We've reduced their military assistance.  We haven't threatened sanctions.  We have to be artful and relatively sophisticated. But my basic point is, in a region in turmoil, it's simply going to be very difficult create to an action-reaction phenomenon.  That's why I go back to the notion of understanding what our core interests are, identifying them, and then trying to protect them.\", \"Look at our behavior.  How can you argue it's a core interest? Well, we are incredibly hypocritical when it comes to humanitarian intervention.  We decide what is feasible, what is convenient, and we essentially ignore the tough cases. Bill Clinton, to this day, and the late Fouad Ajami called him to count.  This is your Rwanda, President Obama.\", 'So, we took a pass.', 'I mean, look.  Our interests --', \"I know.  You're looking for a short answer.  I understand that.\", \"All right.  Okay. [laughter] Aaron David Miller: Our interests and our values and our policies are constantly at war with one another. On the issue of genocide, we have not been consistent.  Not since Roosevelt refused to be more ambitious with respect to trying to overcome the military's opposition to bombing the railways to the concentration camps.  We have taken a pass on genocide and humanitarian intervention in Rwanda, in Congo, in Syria --\", 'Thanks, John.  And, Paul, thank you for articulate, compelling and a gallant defense. And, Mike and Bret, it\\'s -- I appear with you guys all the time.  We have to do this again. Two days before the Camp David Summit, President Clinton, during a briefing, remarked to us -- he knew the odds were long -- that trying and failing was better than not having tried at all.  And I remember how inspired I was by his remarks.  The more I thought about it, the more I watched this angry broken dysfunctional region and Republicans and Democrats alike, equally trying to navigate a course between too much and too little, I began to understand that \"Trying and failing is better than not trying at all,\" is an appropriate slogan for a high school college football team. It is not a substitute for foreign policy of the most consequential nation on earth.  We need to think before we act, and we need to understand, above all, that the dividing line for a smart foreign policy is not between left and right, not between liberal and conservative, not between Republicans and Democrats, it\\'s between smart on one hand and dumb on the other.  And the only question that you have to decide, and I implore you to vote for this motion, because I think our arguments, Paul\\'s in particular, has struck the right balance between risk readiness on one hand, risk aversion on the other, a clear definition of when U.S.  military power and its projection is important and vital and when it is not.  Three questions need to be asked, and if I\\'m too risk averse in this region the historical record of the last 20 years validates my risk aversion. Three questions, number one, \"What are we trying to achieve by deploying military force?\"  Number two, \"Do we have the means at our disposal to accomplish our ends?\" And, number, three, above all, \"What will it cost?\"  You ask those questions, you\\'re firm and resolute, and American interests can be protected.']\n",
      "[\"Well, the president hasn't invited me to the White House for one of those chats over a beer to talk it over, but like all of our other presidents, he's a human being, and he's a political annual too, and so the answer, John, is yes.\", 'Thank you, John.  Flexing muscles, that sounds like posturing, doesn\\'t it?  And posturing doesn\\'t sound like a very good way to conduct foreign policy.  It\\'s not.  But, look, we know what this motion is all about.  It\\'s about the use of the most salient form of muscle the U.S.  has, and that\\'s military force.  And so that\\'s what Aaron and I are going to talk about.  We\\'re not pacifists.  The military instrument has a legitimate role, carefully used in certain times and places.  But unless we carefully consider all the costs and risks and limitations and consequences and reactions to our use of military force, it can, and unfortunately very often in the past has, made things worse.  Now, Aaron\\'s going to talk later about some of the specific issues we\\'ve got facing us in the Middle East. I want to start by talking about how we ought to think about this question.  We hear a lot of \"if only\" kind of arguments: \"If only we used force here or used more force,\" or \"if only we had used more force or put our troops in here or there, something better would happen.\"  Lots of speculation, lots of counterfactuals.  We don\\'t have to dwell just with speculation and counterfactuals.  We have a real record out there of having done a lot of application of military force in this region.  Data point number one -- in fact, there\\'s a whole string of data points -- was, of course, the invasion of Iraq, which extended an expedition for another eight and a half years.  That made things a lot worse for the United States, considering the trillion dollars of cost and the casualties and everything else.  It made things worse for the region because it was a negative example of the so- called birth pangs of democracy and because it stimulated the kinds of sectarian conflict and consciousness we see in Syria and elsewhere. And it was certainly bad for Iraq which -- where it touched off a civil war that has never ended and also gave rise to various forms of extremism.  That group ISIS, or Islamic States, or ISIL, or whatever you want to call it that we\\'re so worried about today, it was born under a different name as a direct response to our invasion of Iraq and the civil war it touched off.  ISIL did not exist before we went into Iraq.  And to talk about Iraq in the past is not just dwelling in the past, it raises the very issues which Aaron will go into more that we\\'re still facing today.  Now, one thing you hear often in the sort of \"if only\" category is \"If only we had somehow kept troops there beyond the eight and a half years, that somehow things would have worked out differently.\" Now, set aside the question of how that could have been done when we had an Iraqi government that was determined to get us out and the previous administration under Mr.  Bush was the one that set the withdrawal deadline.  But the fact is we did try to up the ante militarily.  We had the so-called surge.  You remember that?  And it, along with some other factors, like disillusionment with the extremists among Iraqi-Sunni Arabs, temporarily brought down the level of violence.  But the surge failed in its more fundamental political objective of providing the space for Iraqi politicians to reach an accommodation and build a new and more stable Iraqi political order.  They never did that, and we have the mess that we see today in Iraq.  And anyone who thinks otherwise I think has to answer the question: If eight and a half years were not enough, then how many years would be enough?  Let me just mention one other thing in the past briefly, because it comes under a different administration: the intervention in Libya.  Now, there you already have a civil war going, but we used force to help overthrow Gaddafi, and look at the mess that Libya\\'s in now. About the closest thing we have in the region to it, total anarchy.  And I might remind you, whatever you might have thought of the late Mr. Gaddafi, years before any use of force or even threatening the use of force, he got out of the international terrorism business and he gave up his unconventional weapons programs, leaving him as a sort of quaint and curious dictator, but, frankly, not much of a threat to U.S.  interests.  So, what\\'s going on here?  Why do we have these unfortunate results?  Well, I think there are several patterns that we\\'ve seen again and again.  One is military force is good to accomplish a lot of things.  It\\'s pretty poor to accomplish a lot of other things.  The U.S. military\\'s a great hammer, but some of the thorniest problems we\\'ve got in the Middle East simply are not nails.  Building political and social order is not primarily a matter of killing people.  One\\'s a matter of construction.  The other\\'s a matter of destruction. What has mattered again and again in places like Syria and Iraq and Libya and elsewhere is political will and political culture and the will to reach political accommodation. And that can\\'t be injected through the barrel of a gun.  Closely related to that is the principle that we need the people in the region and the players in the region to become owners of any solution.  If it\\'s just outsiders, whether it\\'s the United States or someone else, then whatever good effect may be brought about, as long as we\\'ve got the strength there, like we had 168,000 troops at one point in Iraq, is not going to last, just like the benefits of the surge didn\\'t last.  Another thing that\\'s happened when we flexed our muscle in this way in the Middle East is the United States has been taking sides in someone else\\'s internal conflict, which in that part of the world is often defined in sectarian or ethnic terms.  And that\\'s no good either.  It\\'s an invitation for the other side to get more involved.  And for the United States, we have no interest -- no national interest -- in taking sides in someone\\'s sectarian civil war. And finally, again and again, we see our use of our muscle engendering the reaction of hatred and anti-Americanism and extremism and terrorism, partly because of the inevitable collateral damage, partly because we\\'re who we are, the superpower, hated, because we come in with our boots trampling on someone else\\'s ground.  So, again and again, we see the reaction, including when Osama bin Laden was initially radicalized as a result of U.S.  troops going into Saudi Arabia, or when ISIS was born after we went into Iraq, or today when ISIS is committing those grisly murders and justifying it by saying it\\'s in response to something we\\'ve done.  So, the Middle East is a pretty messy place.  It can get messier. And to prevent us from making it even messier, we have to ask not what we would hope would happen or wish would happen with the application of military force, but to look at what we\\'ve done in the past and how often it has, in fact, made things worse.  Thank you. [applause]', \"Yeah, Bret's absolutely right that we can't think in terms of what our dreams are in the Middle East.  And that's exactly part of what Aaron and I are criticizing. Again, Iraq 2003, the outstanding example, 2003 plus 8 1/2 years, we had a dream, or at least the makers of that war had a dream of using the regime change in this central Middle Eastern state to stimulate free market economics and democracy, not just in Iraq but throughout the region.  It was the dream.  It wasn't meeting a threat.  It was trying to use military force to accomplish a more positive objective.  And that's one of the ways we went wrong.  You know, meeting real threats, absolutely.  And Bret gave a couple of excellent examples in his initial presentation, like World War II.  We couldn't agree more.  But it's where we've gone beyond meeting threats.\", 'Well, it was a threat to the Yazidis.', \"And I think there are some very tactical decisions that have been very difficult for the administration to make.  And we can get really down in the weeds in terms of, you know, hitting this mountain rather than mountain.  And I don't think Aaron and I are saying, despite the efforts of our worthy opponents to frame the debate in a way that we have to say that every use of military force is for the worst.  That's, of course, not what we're saying.\", 'Yeah, one of the big myths about credibility is that any time we back away from something that\\'s either a losing proposition or not worth the effort or isn\\'t in defense of our key interests, that somehow people and governments all over the world are going to think, \"Oh, the Americans are a bunch of weak-kneed people who aren\\'t going to stand up to their vital interests.\"  That is simply not the case, and there\\'s academic research on this, that it\\'s not the way that other governments think or perceive us.  And to understand that, how would we view the Russians or the Chinese or anyone else who backed away from or did not use military force or flex their muscles in something peripheral, something that was losing, something that was not in their vital interests? Would we say, \"Oh, they\\'re a bunch of weak-kneed lily-livered weaklings, and they\\'re not going to stick up for their vital interests\"?  Of course not.  We would assume they would, and that\\'s the same thing with us.', 'There was no such thing as ISIS or a forerunner of it before we invaded Iraq.  And once we did and the multi-faceted civil war got rolling, a major ingredient of it was Sunni- Arab rejection and resistance both to the Shiites and to us because we were seen as overthrowing, which we did, a Sunni-dominated regime and opening the way to Shiite rule, which is exactly what happened.  And part of that -- one of the most extreme parts of that resistance to what we did was what was then known as Al-Qaeda and Iraq under Mr.  Zarqawi, which is the group that evolved into what we now know today as ISIS or Islamic State.', \"Bret was absolutely right about radical jihadists capitalizing on chaotic situations.  And in this main country we're talking about Iraq, we caused the chaos.  We overthrew the regime, and we didn't have a plan for what followed.\", \"Just, Iraq, most assuredly, was not at peace in 2009.  And we're not going back to Sykes- Picot or running the causation back deck indicates.  We're talking about problems right now, the very issues we're wrestling with right now that are a continuation of what began in the case of Iraq, in 2001.\", \"Well, one difference we've had between the two sides of the stage here, John, is that our opponents keep trying to make this a pro or anti-Obama administration thing, but that's definitely not the case.  And I think Aaron and I both can see pluses and minuses in what's taking place on the ISIS front.  The one substantive point I'd add, John, is that -- is this issue of political will, because ultimately, the fate of this group certainly in Iraq, but also in Syria, is going to depend on the politics and the capital -- and we've had some encouraging signs in Baghdad -- but further political evolution so that Iraqi Sunnis know that they've got a future in an Iraq that is not dominated by ISIS.\", 'Well, we --', '-- we got rid of Maliki.', \"I think overall the more deeply we get immersed into sectarian and internal conflicts in either Syria or Iraq, the greater are all the hazards that we've talked about of making things worse.\", 'That does not mean there are not appropriate uses of military force such as rescuing the Yazidis on a mountaintop.', 'I think the path we are on carries much risk of escalation to damaging directions that do make things worse.', \"I don't know what you mean by sanctions getting squishy. We can argue all night about sanctions.  They've worked in some cases and not worked in others, and there are all kinds of variables that take too much time to come into play. But I would mention just one example.  And we've cited it in other ways in the past. Libya, that was a successful use of sanctions against Gaddafi.  And he made this tremendous turn away from his previous outrageous behavior with regard to his unconventional weapons programs, weapons of mass destruction, and his rampant involvement in international terrorism.  And back in the 1990s, after several years of multilateral sanctions in which he felt both the economic hurt and the political hurt of being a pariah, he changed.  He got out of the international terrorism business, and he opened up and gave up his unconventional weapons program.  And that was all without use or even the threat of military force.  That was a successful case.\", \"That's factually wrong there.\", 'I know it is wrong because I was personally involved in the negotiations with the Libyans back in 1999 --', '-- four years before that --', '-- four years before that --', '-- and that was after -- [talking simultaneously]', 'Gaddafi made those decisions in the 1990s.  When I sat down across the table from his intelligence chief, he had already decided to get out of the unconventional weapons programs and get out of international terrorism. That was four years before the invasion of Iraq.', 'You know, Mike now has twice used phraseology that I think John shows some of the differences we have despite all that wonderful agreement we had earlier.', \"I didn't hit him on that, but --\", \"A bias -- you know, I don't think our foreign policy ought to be biased one way or the other toward action or toward inaction.  It ought to be an unbiased way of cost and benefits and weighing of those core interests that we were talking about a moment ago  [applause] -- and not come at it with a preconception that we ought to be acting more than [unintelligible] or the other way around.\", \"Bret's mentioned several times this Iranian nuclear thing.  I wish we had more time to talk about that, but that's one thing where the U.S.  administration, the current one, has taken a lot of action.  They seize the opportunity to have the negotiations that have taken place over the last year, which gives us the best chance to deal with exactly the sorts of threats if you're worried about them, that Bret described.  Military force, flexing that muscle, isn't going to do any good, because besides not destroying the capability of Iran to build a nuclear weapon, if they really wanted to, it gives the best possible incentive to construct a nuclear deterrent.\", 'Well, first I want to thank Bret and Mike for their very spirited contributions to this debate and, John, for your very even-handed moderation, and most of all to my colleague Aaron.  You know, we Americans have an awful lot of faith in our ability to do great things overseas. It is a well founded faith, because we have done some great things, including with the use of military force, like Bret mentioned earlier in his opening remarks.  World War II is probably the best example of all.  But some things, even we the superpower can\\'t do, even with our military might.  I\\'ve served in the U.S.  military and in a foreign conflict. And in my case, it was as an army officer in the Vietnam War.  That war was an extremely painful lesson to us, the American people, about the limitations of what we can do with military force.  And among the bad consequences it had was getting to the issue of credibility, it reduced the credibility that the U.S.  would use that military instrument in other better ways because of the American people\\'s reaction to what had happened.  Enough years went by, and we finally got over what happened and what we called the Vietnam syndrome.  In one way, we demonstrated we got over it was another thing that Bret mentioned, the splendid victory in the Middle East reversing Saddam Hussein\\'s aggression against Kuwait in 1991. But the problem is, since then, we\\'ve been thinking more and doing more of using military force not just to reverse someone else\\'s aggression like in World War II or operation Enduring Freedom or Desert Storm.  We got into other things, changing regimes we didn\\'t like or taking part in someone else\\'s civil war, or trying to inject democracy through the barrel of a gun.  Leadership is not just flexing muscle.  It is having the wisdom to know the limitations and the costs and the risks, and most of all to follow the Hippocratic principle of \"first do no harm.\"', 'Thank you. [applause]']\n",

      "['Well honestly John, we werent thinking about political backlash.  We were thinking about what was best for kids, but I do agree that the issue has become a little bit of a political football, which I think is unfortunate and I hope people will focus on whats best for children.', 'My partner is my sometimes opponent actually, always my friend and distinguished colleague, the brilliant Michael Petrilli.', 'Thank you John and thanks to Intelligence Squared for bringing this debate here tonight and including me in it.  I want to start by telling you the story of Janelle, a young woman from Philadelphia who I spoke to recently.  And whose story embodies why I feel so strongly that the Common Core is a crucial step forward for American education.  Janelle is an African American woman from the north side of Philadelphia.  Her parents believed in the power of education to transform lives.  They had one overriding message for their daughter:  Do well in school and you will be the first person in the family to go to college. Janelle got the message. She worked hard. She took honors courses. She got all As. She was her vice president of her senior class. And she graduated in the top of her class. She was number three in her class. She diligently applied to college, and she and her parents ecstatically celebrated when she not only got into college, a public four-year institution in Pennsylvania, but got a full scholarship. But it wasn\\'t very long after going to college before she realized that she had been duped. The As she\\'d earned in her honors courses in high school seemed to bear little relationship with what it took to succeed in her college-level courses. In subject after subject, she struggled, becoming more and more dejected. She explained to me how one of the problems that she encountered was that in high school, her teachers helped her translate her textbooks. But when she got to college, her professors expected her to be able to do that for herself and then analyze the information, as opposed to just understanding it. And her -- she didn\\'t have those skills. They hadn\\'t taught them to her in her high school. As a result -- as a result, Janelle\\'s GPA dropped and she lost eligibility for her scholarships. Now, the good news is, she did -- she has managed to return to college as a sophomore. She was able to fill the gap left by her scholarships with student loans. Many children in her -- in her situation would have given up and dropped out. The Common Core is for Janelle and for the thousands of students who are giving it their all but not getting their money\\'s worth. Now, I agree with something Rick has said before, which is that standards are meaningless unless they\\'re translated into effective instruction. As Mike noted, the Common Core is not a silver bullet for all that ails our education system. But it is an essential building block. And for students like Janelle who, for generations, have been shortchanged by the old, failed system, new standards will help ensure they are never left behind again. We know what we were doing before wasn\\'t working. We see remediation rates as high as one in four college students who are not ready for college-level material. And that translates, just here in New York, to $80 million in wasted resources that could be spent on other supports for our students to be successful. And that doesn\\'t even address the students like Janelle who are not in remediation, but are struggling with college level content. Some schools, like the one that Carol runs, have adopted International Baccalaureate programs or advanced placement courses to supplement the old state standards, but we can\\'t rely on visionary principles like Carol -- or a patchwork of programs to close our nation\\'s gaping achievement gaps or prepare future generations to compete with China. Now, I\\'d like to cut -- clear up a couple misconceptions about the Common Core that had been promoted by the Glenn Becks of the world. First the Common Core was not developed in secret and was not developed by the federal government. This was an initiative led by Democratic Governor Markell of Delaware and Republican Governor Sonny Perdue of Georgia. Back in 2008, virtually all of the governors, with the exception of Rick Perry and Sarah Palin, were strongly supportive of it. Unlike the previous patchwork of standards, the Common Core was developed with significant input from educators and content experts, like the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The authors consulted teacher unions, the civil rights community, college leaders, and business leaders. The standards were revised based on over 10,000 comments from the general public. And contrary to the assertion of the opposition, most teachers are not opposed to the standards, and indeed strongly support them. Now, I appreciate that there has been a great deal of controversy about the way the standards have been implemented and concerns with how test scores are being used in our education system. I think those concerns are real. And we should -- we should address them. But -- and teachers, when asked about the standards in the context of accountability -- particularly accountability for themselves -- their own performance -- they\\'re hesitant about the standards. But despite these concerns, a Winston poll in early August revealed that two out of three teachers approved of the adoption and believed they are what their students need to be successful. And when implementation is done well, which I strongly believe requires that you use teachers to help you develop an implementation plan -- teachers feel excited about the standards and believe they have more, not less, freedom in their classroom. John, a high school geometry teacher, said it better than I could: The old standards gave teachers a set of specific and sometimes constricting direction on where to turn, when to turn, and how fast to go.  The Common Core standards instead give us mileposts to aim for, tell us where we should end up but not how to get there. And this was something that Mike and I heard loud and clear this afternoon when we were talking to teachers from right here in New York.  Later in the debate, I\\'m sure we\\'ll talk more about the challenges of implementation and the need for commonsense use of tests.  Those are important issues.  But because we have challenges doesn\\'t mean that we should turn our backs on the incredible work that\\'s been done over the last four years here in New York and around the country to lay the groundwork for the implementation of these standards.  I think there are commonsense ways we can and should make implementation go more smoothly.  As Mike said, I think that the Common -- new assessments aligned to the Common Core will address one of the chief complaints of teachers and students alike, fill in the bubble tests. Because the Common Core requires children become problem solvers and good communicators, the new tests aligned to them will measure complex thinking, reading, writing, communications, and problem solving kids\\' skills.  As a result, teachers will no longer be driven to narrow the curriculum or teach to a bad test.  There have always been standards and always will be standards. There have always been tests and there always will be tests.  It\\'s time to get them right.  For that reason, I ask you to \"Embrace the Common Core.\" [applause]', 'Well, I would say again, this was an effort that was underway before President Obama was President Obama.  It was led by a democratic and republican governor from very diverse states.  They had the support of virtually again, Sarah Palin and Rick Perry dont support much, but the other 48 governors were strongly supportive of it. And the Obama administration supported an initiative that was state led, that was driven from, I would argue, bottom up, not top down.  And I think what we need to keep in mind though, is even if--well never know how many states would have adopted the standards but for the incentives provided by the federal government.  But then the question before us right now is, given that it was something that was developed, through I would argue, contrary to Carol, through a very rigorous process.  It brought teachers into the process.  It brought the public into the process.  And then once each state adopted it, there was process at the state level around the standards.  So, then the question before us is, are the standards good for our students?  And Mike and I think it is.', 'Well, I would say --', \"-- it's early to judge the implementation of the standards.\", 'I understand that.', \"I would -- but I would say, although it's early, we do see some signs of success. And I would point to Kentucky, which was one of the first states to adopt the Common Core. And in --\", 'Well --', 'Okay.', \"Well, I mean, I think that's just factually inaccurate. I think that the folks who got together to draft the new standards relied very heavily on the existing research that they had about what children needed to be able to do and what set of knowledge they needed to have to be successful in college and in good jobs. They brought in the people from the post-secondary sector, something that hadn't been done in K-12 education historically, which really is pretty illogical that that hadn't been done before. They brought in people from the business community to talk about what skills they needed their employees to have. They brought in content experts. They showed the standards to the associations that represent teachers in mathematics and English language arts. And they took in their input. I think neither Mike nor I would say that each and every standard is perfect. But I think if you look at the process that was used in the development of these standards and compare --\", '-- it to the process that was used under the old standards by most states, that it was very rigorous, and they did look at evidence. And you can --', '-- disagree, but they did look at evidence.', 'Yeah.', 'Well, first, I just want to finish Mike\\'s thought there.  I mean, when we talked to teachers today, they acknowledge that when the standards were first brought to their schools, they were concerned that they would be too hard for their children, but we heard things like reports that teachers said, \"Wow, I didn\\'t think they\\'d be able to do it and they are,\" and talk about the joy that they\\'ve had in seeing their children meet that challenge.  And I have to say, as a former civil rights attorney, it just makes me very nervous when people talk about how, you know, you need to --', \"-- some kids can't reach the same expectations as other kids.\", 'Yeah.', \"Yeah, like I said earlier the point -- the example that Carol made about being able to count to one -- to 100 in ones and tens, I know lots of five-year olds who can do that.  And I think that if we ask children coming from all different backgrounds to be able to do that, they'll be able to do that. And, you know, I think that we have lots of evidence that we're -- what we're asking them to do under the old standards wasn't working, that --\", \"I would say the Common Core standards very much drive towards teaching and assessment that is focused on creating problem solvers and good communicators, those kinds of skills.  And we heard just today from a group of teachers that we talked to, that under the new assessments, they cant teach to the tests anymore, because the tests are no longer about rote memorization. Its about children being able to make inferences and digest the texts, so I think it goes exactly to the point that you mentioned.  The crafters of the Common Core did look at at PISA. They also looked at Massachusetts and they did borrow from places where they thought it was working, as well as looking into the evidence, so I think it really tackles the issue that you're talking about very effectively. And I think assessments aligned to those kinds of standards should really help us move away from a mode of rote memorization towards teaching in an enriched way.\", \"Sure. I would say there have been analysis comparing the Common Core to the high- achieving states, like Massachusetts, and shown that they are comparable and higher in some respects. So, I -- and I think if you look at -- talk to the folks in Massachusetts -- just as an example -- they feel like the Common Core is helping them to serve all their students -- because they're focused on development as skills, again, and not just rote memorization and test preparation, that it's helping -- we heard this today as well, but it's helping children across the spectrum in terms of where they start. I started saying earlier, Kentucky is one of the first states to implement the Common Core. In just one year, their high school graduates ready for college and career jumped from 34 percent to 47 percent. And that's still not good enough, but that shows clear progress. [applause] You -- also in New York, this year, again, slow progress, but since implementation of the Common Core, there has been increase in performance. And the best increase has been among minority populations. Three to four percentage points for African American and Hispanic students here in New York.\", 'Well, I don\\'t have the exact numbers in terms of how much time will be spent testing, but it is my hope that under these new better fairer fewer assessments under the Common Core that we can eliminate a lot of the testing that happens around the country under the old set of standards and assessments, what we see across the country is districts layering on additional assessments on top.  And I think as we move towards these better assessments under the Common Core that we can eliminate unnecessary testing.  I think testing is a tough issue.  It\\'s something -- my kids hate it, and I have to explain to them why they have to do it and how it provides really valuable information to their teachers about how they\\'re doing so they can help them to do better, just like when I bring my child to the doctor and they say, \"I really don\\'t want to get that shot,\" sometimes you have to do things that aren\\'t very pleasant.  I think what\\'s important is to make sure that in creating a culture around testing, we\\'re not making children stressed out, we\\'re not making them cry over the tests.  And I think that part of that is professional development, the environment in the school around the tests. [applause] We heard that -- we heard that from some teachers we talked to today about how that\\'s -- and that takes a lot of leadership in the school to make sure that it is being used as a tool to get better.  I think Carol has made a lot of good points about the way assessments are being used, that we really should take a closer look at that --they do help create a negative culture around testing.  But again, that\\'s about how the tests are used, not what the standards should be and whether you should have the assessments so you can learn from them and improve practice.', \"Yeah. They are not copyrighted. They're open. And teachers -- I think where we see Common Core being implemented effectively, teachers aren't following a script. What we see is that the -- as I said in my opening, the standards create guide posts, a destination. And teachers are able to then construct lessons so they can differentiate for the children in their class. We have heard very positive things from teachers of special ed students, that in some ways, they're better than the old way because it allows you to get the answer through different methodologies -- and math, for example, it's -- allows for different ways to get to the answer. So, I would say that they should not feel scripted. I do think, in some places, with that -- with those bad instructional leadership, they're being given scripts and told to follow the script. But I don't think that's the right way to implement the standards. And I don't think the standards themselves dictate that. I think the standards really try to shift in the direction of giving teachers more freedom, like the teacher that I quoted in my opening had mentioned.\", 'Thanks, John.', 'Okay.', \"Thank you, John.  As a mom and a former civil rights attorney, I've seen firsthand the consequences of low expectations and their long term effects.  Our children do deserve more.  They deserve to be taught to the level that they need to be successful in college and career, and that's the overarching goal of these standards, and there's lots of evidence to support that it will get them to where they need to be.  The Common Core gives teachers the space to create an exciting classroom experience for all rooted high expectations, project-based learning, problem solving, and exploring concepts deeply instead of focusing on worksheets and rote memorization. If this were 2012, all four of us -- all four of the panelists here would be in agreement that we should not repeal the Common Core.  Carol said as recently as 2012 that higher level thinking is more prominent in the Common Core than in all present state standards.  And Rick said just last week that he was not necessarily saying to pull out of the Common Core.  I think what he's saying tonight is the jury is out.  What Mike and I are saying is to -- let's keep moving forward because our children can't afford to wait any longer for higher standards, and they can't rely on extraordinary principles or teachers to help them get there.  The achievement gaps in our country are staggering, and it's time to tackle them aggressively.  Your vote tonight will be closely watched and folks outside of this theater may not understand all of the nuance of Rick and Carol's position.  A vote to not embrace the Common Core will be interpreted as a vote to repeal the Common Core altogether. And as Mike said, we do not believe that there are good alternatives to that.  There are real consequences to this decision, higher versus lower standards, new expenses in changing course, frustration for countless educators.  Those consequences should be at the forefront of your decision.  Students who come to high school, falling behind, only one in 10 of them get to catch up, according to a recent ACT study.  We need to get to them earlier.\", 'I urge you to \"Embrace the Common Core.\"']\n",
      "['I was hoping for \"good-looking,\" but I\\'ll take brilliant. That\\'s good -- that\\'s okay.', 'Yeah.', 'Affirmative.', 'Right.', \"Perhaps a little lonelier, but it's important to know that still half of the nation's Republican governors are supportive of the Common Core. So, lonelier, but I am far from alone.\", 'Absolutely. On the left and the right.', 'Thank you very much. It\\'s a real honor to be here. I was just surprised -- I just saw Rick press the undecided button. So, that was interesting. We\\'ll see how that goes. It is such an honor to be here today. Let me tell you a little bit about what our game plan is, that - - Carmel and I. We\\'ve been together all afternoon, we\\'ve been scheming about this.  I will start by talking about what it means to embrace the Common Core.  Then I will talk about some of the problems in our education system and frankly in previous waves of reform that the Common Core is trying to address. Carmel then is going to talk about the process of developing the Common Core, the role that educators play, the role that evidence played, as well as talk about some of the equity issues that are at stake here, how the Common Core can help to narrow the achievement gap.  Now, what you won\\'t hear us argue is, first of all, that Common Core is going to solve all of our nation\\'s educational problems because, of course, it won\\'t.  You\\'re not going to hear us say that the Common Core are perfect.  They were not handed down from Mount Sinai, they are not set in stone, right, or we\\'re going to hear plenty of concerns about this individual standard or that individual standard, so you won\\'t hear us say that they\\'re perfect.  And you\\'re not going to hear us say that it\\'s all going perfectly out there around the country, because, of course, it\\'s not all going perfectly out there around the country.  This is a big country, 50 million kids in public schools, 100,000 of those schools, and like any ambitious reform, it\\'s a work in progress, okay?  But what you are going to hear us argue is that despite all of that you should still embrace the Common Core. Now, why is that?  Why should you embrace the Common Core?  And what does that mean?  In our view, to embrace the Common Core is, first of all, to embrace the idea that our schools should have standards, all right, that doesn\\'t sound so radical, and that the standards that we have should be set at a high enough level to indicate that our students are ready for what comes next.  And that means kids graduating from high school, that they\\'re either ready to go and succeed in college or to go and get a good paying job.  Now, what you might have to understand is that this is a radical departure from how we used to do this.  States did have standards before the Common Core, but, by and large, they were set at a very, very low level.  And so what that meant is that students could meet those standards, they could pass the standardized tests connected to those standards, but it didn\\'t mean that they were ready for success later on.  In fact, in many states it didn\\'t even mean that they were at grade level.  And so we had a system that was giving a lot of false information out there to students, to teachers, to parents alike. So, to embrace the Common Core is to say, \"Let\\'s embrace standards that are set at this college and career ready level.\"  It\\'s also to say that we should embrace the idea of moving to next generation assessments, right, tests that measure these standards, that are worlds better than the tests that we\\'ve been living with for the past two decades.  Many of us in this room as parents or as teachers, we know that there has been this huge focus on standardized testing in this country.  And unfortunately, by and large, those tests have been terrible, fill in the blank, multiple choice tests, tests that don\\'t do a good job measuring what students know and that encourage very low level kind of teaching and learning in the classroom.  But now, after four years, we\\'re finally getting to the point where there are new assessments coming connected to the Common Core that are going to be much more like advanced placement exams or international baccalaureate exams like the ones that Carol uses in her school, and this is our chance to move to those assessments.  So, if you embrace the Common Core, its high standards, its next generation assessments, that\\'s what we are moving towards. Now, what\\'s the problem we\\'re trying to address?  Every study that\\'s ever been done on American education comes to pretty much the same conclusion.  It\\'s not that our schools are failing, though some are failing, but on the large, it\\'s not that schools are failing, it\\'s that our schools, by and large, are mediocre when compared to schools overseas.  They\\'re in the middle of the pack.  They\\'re not the best schools in the world, they\\'re not the worst schools in the world.  They\\'re in the middle of the pack.  And it\\'s not just our demographics.  It\\'s not just because we have a lot of childhood poverty, though we do. Our rich kids are in the middle of the pack compared to other rich kids around the world, poor kids, middle class kids, high achievers, low achievers.  Throughout the education system, it\\'s this concern around mediocrity.  And we\\'ve known this for 30 years.  And we have been working hard at trying to address that.  And we\\'ve made some progress, right?  Poor and minority and low achieving kids today are reading and doing math two to three grade levels ahead of where they were back in the 1990s.  That\\'s incredible progress. And our public education system deserves credit for making that progress.  And almost certainly it was because back in the \\'90s and 2000s, states decided to set standards, to have tests that measured those standards, and to have accountability systems to make those standards stick.  And it -- again, we\\'ve made real progress.  But because the standards were set so low and because the tests have been so easy, all of the focus has been getting the lowest performing kids over that very low standard, right?  And that\\'s led to great progress for the kids at the bottom but it hasn\\'t done much for the kids at the middle or the kids at the top because they were so far ahead of those standards that it didn\\'t get much traction with them.  At the same time, it\\'s come along with a lot of unintended consequences, and we know about those, too, teaching to the test, narrowing of the curriculum, driving out a lot of the joy that we want to have in our schools, okay?  And again, Carol, Rick, many others have been very eloquent on this point. This is our chance to embrace the Common Core, is to fix all of that, to move to a system with much higher standards but also better tests that give better information but that also encourage better teaching and learning in the classroom.  Carmel and I had a chance today to meet with a group of teachers, many of them are here in the room tonight, to tell us how it\\'s going with Common Core.  And it\\'s not perfect. There\\'s issues, and there is bumps in the road, but they talked about these higher expectations for their students that some of these kids, they couldn\\'t -- you know, four years ago they couldn\\'t believe that the kids could perform at the level that they\\'re performing now, but these higher standards have pushed them in that direction.  Now, Rick and Carol are going to say that we should not embrace the Common Core, and I don\\'t know if they\\'re willing to hug the Common Core or kiss the Common Core or fist bump the Common Core, so I\\'m not -- we\\'ll see what their position it, but what do they want?  Do they want us to go back to the old standards, the ones that were set way too low, that gave everybody this false impression that everything was fine?  Do they want us to stick with the -- still the standardized tests, these rinky-dink standardized tests that we\\'ve lived with for 20 years? Do they want to follow the example of Oklahoma, the one state in the country that has repealed the Common Core and replaced it with something else right away, and in Oklahoma today, today in Oklahoma schools, teachers did not know what standards they were supposed to teach to.  They don\\'t know six months from now which tests they\\'re going to be held accountable to, but I guarantee you it\\'s not going to be one of these next generation assessments because there\\'s no time and there\\'s no money for that.  It\\'s going to be one of these rinky-dink assessments instead.  Lots more to talk about throughout this debate, but for all of those reasons, this is why you should vote to \"Embrace the Common Core.\"  Thank you.', \"I did. Yes. [laughter] And it had a question mark at the end. That was good. Yes. Absolutely. And if we were here to debate the federal role in education, I would move over there. Maybe Carol would be over here. I'm not sure. But we are here to debate --\", \"-- to debate the Common Core, right? It is true. Look, the -- I think everybody is in agreement. I wrote an article recently with a strong opponent of the Common Core. We wrote together. Here are the facts. It started out as a state-led initiative. And then the Obama Administration came in and endorsed it. There's no doubt that it had a big impact in the number of states that got involved. And in my opinion, we would all be much better off if the federal government would now butt out. So, Carmel, maybe you can share that view with the Secretary of Education. [laughter]\", 'Yeah, and I\\'m so glad that you raised this, a couple times, this idea of close reading.  And I spent the big part of the weekend talking to some reading experts getting ready for this question, and I think I have a better understanding.  It\\'s going to get a little weedy, but I\\'ll get through it very fast.  And it\\'s this.  We\\'ve had a system for years where we\\'ve said, \"Okay, if a child can only read at the first-grade level and they\\'re in fifth grade, we\\'re going to give them first-grade level books, right, with the hope that over time they would get better.  The problem is there\\'s five or six rigorous studies showing by and large those kids were never getting better at reading. And that they\\'re -- what the studies showed is what you really need to do is find ways to get the kids to read more challenging texts at their grade level, which means at first -- and the teachers today helped explain this so, so much better than I could -- that the teachers start by reading it aloud, having the kids follow along.  They do what they call, \"scaffolding,\" over time.  And over time, they start to teach the kids how to do this reading so that they can let go of the handlebar and they can ride the bike on their own.  And kids who are way behind grade level, including kids who are special education students, are never going to make progress if we don\\'t challenge them with those grade level texts.  This is what the evidence says, and the Common Core looks at the evidence. [applause]', 'Right, but Rick, is that actually in the standards?  Do the standards say that?  No.  What the standards say is that children need to read at grade level proficiently.', 'But when there is evidence --', \"-- as we have now in early reading -- there was evidence 20 years ago on phonics -- on phonemic awareness, that was finally incorporated into our schools -- now we have good evidence that these level texts, just having kids who are fifth graders reading first grade texts over and over again, has not been working.  Now we have that evidence.  It's time to follow the evidence.  And that's what Common Core does.  Not every point has that, but where there is evidence -- we know that calculator use in the first grade, not a good idea. The Common Cores says we should not be using calculators till the kids get older.  These are dramatically more evidence based than the standards that came before.\", \"Yeah, yeah, no.  Well, I will be happy to go find it for you after this debate. [laughter] I don't have it with me.  But, look, here's the question --\", \"I -- no, I'm absolutely confident.  Look, this has been the dominant way we have taught reading now for decades.  And you look at our achievement in reading, and it is mostly flat.  And you look at our achievement in reading for special education kids, for kids who are behind, and what you find is that they are not making progress fast enough.  We've done better in math where we've made greater progress, particularly for poor kids, but in reading it's been slow.  We've made some progress in teaching early reading because of phonics and phonemic awareness because there we finally followed the evidence.\", 'And what I\\'m saying is that we need to follow the evidence.  The Common Core is saying that\\'s what we need to do, follow the evidence.  Kids deserve to be challenged. The teachers I talk to today, you know -- [applause] -- I mean, Carol\\'s argument earlier -- the four words, \"These are too hard,\" right?', 'Right.', 'Right, is that their concerns are very well founded, as are the concerns of many educators who have been complaining for years, decades now, that the tests weve been using to judge schools are not well designed.  And theyre right.  Those tests by and large have been very inexpensive tests.  Theyve been set at a low level.  Theyve been fill in the blank.  And now we finally have this opportunity to move to much better tests with the Common Core, that are under development, that are coming this spring for the very first time in about half of the country.  And this is our opportunity to now address many of those concerns.  And for example, these tests will have a lot more writing on them than most of the other tests had.  Its very hard to test kids critical thinking skills if its just multiple choice.  Right, certainly hard to test their writing skills. Yet a state like Georgia has been trying to get by with a test that costs eight dollars per kid and therefore doesnt have any writing on it.  And what were trying to do here is to turn that page.  And say look, there were major problems with the test under the No Child Left Behind era.  Weve heard those concerns and now were trying to get something better, something that I think that Carol and Rick have supported in the past.', \"Well, you know, I know Rick spends a lot of his time writing books in a cave somewhere.  I think he's been in a cave perhaps -- [laughter] -- because Rick is 2014.  Teachers have been implementing these standards for four years in these states, okay? [applause] So, you know, there are enormous --\", 'You know, there are enormous, enormous costs, financial, morale issues.  You know, teachers have put their heart and soul into teaching these standards -- I mean, we heard from some of these teachers today -- for four years.  So let\\'s be clear that this is not now a hypothetical argument, \"Should we move forward?  Should we adopt the Common Core?\"  Schools have adopted it.  They\\'re moving forward.  And so now the question is, \"Should we go back and undo all the work of the last four years?\" And you\\'ve held this very high bar, both you and Carol today, that basically the Common Core have to be remarkable in order to go ahead.  So if you\\'re going to go back to those old standards, those lower standards, in the vast majority of states, what is your evidence that we should move to those lower standards?  Why aren\\'t you having a high bar for that? [applause]', 'Thank you.  That\\'s a great question.  You know, this is key.  And we\\'ve had these debates for a long time.  Just to say that, you know, standards does not have to equal standardization, right?  We want to make sure that our education system is linked to success for what comes next, and that means that if we\\'re measuring student progress, this should be against the real world and what they\\'re going to have.  But that does not mean that we have a standard way of getting there.  Different schools have different approaches, different teachers have different approaches, and different kids are going to learn different ways, and that\\'s all absolutely appropriate.  What we don\\'t want to have is a system that has standards that are set so low that we\\'re giving the false impression that kids are doing fine when they\\'re not.  And, you know, Carol, I know you keep saying, \"Well, it\\'s not too high, it\\'s not too low, it\\'s just wrong.\"  Go back to those old systems, okay?  Colorado, before they adopted the Common Core, for example, you could score at the 10th percentile in reading in Colorado and be considered proficient, okay?  So you would get a report as a parent that your child is proficient.  That\\'s great. Okay, what you didn\\'t know was that, that meant that 90 percent of the kids at that same grade level nationwide were reading better than you were.  That meant that you weren\\'t ever even close to being on grade level.  That is the system that we had, and that is the system that state states that are thinking about pulling out the Common Core, which is mostly in these red states, with big Tea Party influence.  That is what they are going back, thats what this is about, thats why we need to keep moving forward.', 'Right so, lets go back to the question about testing.  Rick is right, that there are a number of states out there, that because of political pressure, mostly from the political right, have decided to pull back from the Common Core testing.  Right, its because thats the position you are arguing.  Your position is being heard in red states and they are saying, therefore were not going to do these better tests.  Were going to do our own tests.  Because we dont want anything involved with the federal government. Were afraid of all kinds of other issues.  My argument is that those states have not embraced the Common Core. They have not fully embraced the Common Core.  Because you cannot embrace higher standards if you dont also embrace better assessments.', 'They go together.', 'It means embracing a rigorous standard .', 'Then I am excited. [applause] Michael Petrilli: What I think Im hearing Rick, is that you agree with our position, that we should embrace the Common Core, embrace good assessment and make sure that the states are [unintelligible].', 'Right.  I would prefer that kind of policy.  And it looks like the states that are doing the PARCC test, as far as we can tell, are going to agree to a common cut score.  Were not sure yet about Smarter Balance.  I think even those other states, even those that dont have great tests, all signs are, even those are going to have much more challenging cut scores than they had before.  So we will have made some progress on these issues.  But look, Rick, I would love-', 'That is a yes.', 'How long do you want to wait?', 'Follow through on what we started?', 'Youd like us to follow through on what we started?', \"Sure. Let's talk about --\", 'New York is an interesting case, because it is the only state in the country that has developed a fully fleshed out curriculum. And I think you can certainly make the case that it\\'s too fleshed out. And out -- and good administrators will tell their teachers, \"Hey, use it as a resource. And it\\'s there for you. But by no means should you be following it word-by-word,\" okay? [applause] You know, it -- most states have the opposite problem, which is that there\\'s nothing. There\\'s nothing been developed, and teachers are saying, \"I\\'m desperate for something to help me teach to these standards.\" And what those teachers usually use is Engage New York. [laughter]', 'Great. Thank you, John. And thank you so much to Rick, and Carol, and Carmel for this great discussion. It\\'s -- it is so nice for a change to have a discussion about the Common Core that is so substantive, because unfortunately, that\\'s not been what\\'s happening for much of the last couple of years. I just want to say to some of the points that Rick and Carol made. They\\'re very smart to go and to look at some of the specific standards that they\\'ve got questions about. And as we said at the beginning, there\\'s no doubt, the Common Core are not perfect, nor are they set in stone. You look at states around the country, they have found ways to add to the standards. Florida, for example, adding calculus to their math standards because of some of the concerns that Rick made. Totally legitimate. Other states adding cursive, because parents have been concerned we\\'re not teaching cursive. There are no Common Core cops.  States are free to do that, and they should do that.  And they should make them their own.  But I want to talk again about what happens on the other side of this if you go backwards.  Rick is right.  Rick\\'s book, \"Spinning Wheels,\" you should read it.  It\\'s a classic, right?  You want to see spinning wheels?  Go check out Oklahoma right now, because that\\'s where you have spinning wheels, because the legislature decided out of political pressure to pull back on these standards.  You listen to Jeannetta Jante [spelled phonetically], she\\'s a English language arts teacher at Oklahoma City\\'s Southeast High School, she called that decision a \"travesty.\"  She says, quote, \"Now it\\'s like we\\'ve wasted teacher training, teacher time, lesson planning, resources, all of those things we\\'ve just done.  The senators have basically said, \\'Oops, sorry, we didn\\'t mean for you to do all of that.\\' The chaos in the classrooms will be great.  The chaos in the classrooms will be great.\"  Okay, we are four years into this.  And many, many teachers, millions of teachers across the country are working hard at making Common Core work.  We should follow through now on what we have started.  We should make it better as we go.  We should address problems and challenges.  But we should embrace the Common Core.  Thank you.

      "['I met some journalists.  A time came in the late 1960s when I met a bunch of journalists.  I was very impressed, almost awed by what they were doing, the skill with which they were doing it, and the national service that I thought they were doing by supporting the First Amendment.', \"My partner, I am very honored to be with one of the great civil liberties lawyers, and I mean this, in the country's history, Nadine Strossen. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 6 -\", 'Good evening.  I want to start with a point that Nadine made, which I don\\'t think was responded to, and that is that without the ability to spend money, we don\\'t have political speech, at least we don\\'t have enough political speech to have a chance to win most elections.  Look around this room.  Imagine that this was not the national Constitution center but a political hall, but otherwise just the same, with all you people here.  We couldn\\'t have this event, we couldn\\'t have a debate without paying for the lights, the microphones, the cameras, everything in the room. There are people here, I want to assure you not the speakers, who are being here tonight. And none of this could occur if people didn\\'t spend money to back it up, to make it happen, to allow it to happen.  Now, Burt talked about -- he used the phrase about \"One man, one vote.\"  We have never ever lived in a system of one speech, one person, or limited speech per person.  We don\\'t say that.  We wouldn\\'t imagine saying that to our newspapers or our media entities, however large they are.  If you were to take Burt\\'s point literally, you would say, \"It is -- we cannot persist in the notion that Rupert Murdoch can have all the money and power he has,\" or that the Philadelphia Inquirer could have all the power that at least it once had in Philadelphia and that it certainly does to a significant degree today. It\\'s perfectly true to say that people with money have more influence and power than people who don\\'t.  That\\'s the way of the world.  How do we deal with that?  We can deal with equality as best we can as a public.  We can have laws.  Some of them we have already.  We can have better laws about people being able to vote instead of closing polls early in the day.  We can limit the money if that\\'s what we\\'re after.  We can have higher taxes.  I\\'m not advocating anything today.  I\\'m just saying it doesn\\'t violate the First Amendment to have a wealth tax.  It doesn\\'t violate the First Amendment to crack Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - down on banks.  It doesn\\'t violate the First Amendment to have tougher antitrust laws.  It does violate the First Amendment to limit speech. And that is what the negative side of this proposition necessarily is urging on you. Indeed, Burt did it.  He is always straightforward.  He was straightforward tonight.  What is the argument?  Too few people have too much power.  And, therefore, what?  They should not be allowed to speak as much as their money might allow, or, to put it differently, because they have more money and are prepared to spend it on political speech, our Congress, the very people who as Nadine pointed out have the most direct personal interest in passing legislation which will keep them in power -- that the Congress can pass Constitutional legislation limiting the amount of their speech.  The Supreme Court put it very well in 1976 in the Buckley case referred to by Burt. I want to read you one line.  The court said, \"The concept that the government may restrict the speech of some elements in our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\"  That\\'s what the court said.  That\\'s what the law is right now.  And I think it is a glorious articulation of First Amendment principle.  And these were not the five supposedly rabid rightwing conservatives who gave us Citizens United.  This was Justice Brennan, this was Justice Thurgood Marshall, this was Justice Potter Stewart, three of the most stalwart defenders of the First Amendment in our history. And what they were saying is, \"You can deal with problems in a lot of ways, you can deal with the equality problem in lots of ways, but the one way you can\\'t deal with it is by shutting up the voices of others or limiting the voices of others, wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\"  This is one of the things that makes us so special in the world.  I mean, it\\'s only we, and we should be proud of it, but only we have a first amendment as strong, as totally controlling over what Congress can do as we do.  So I would urge on you that while to some degree I understand that it seems not fair that people who have more money should have more power, if you want to deal with it, and we should sometimes, if you want to deal with that, don\\'t deal with speech. One of the First Amendment principles that\\'s first is hurt speech last. So, I urge you to vote yes on this resolution.', \"What you're missing is that the one area of speech which is most protected is political speech.  There's nothing that we protect more than that.  There's no area in which we give the Congress less leeway to act for a variety of reasons, not least that the single most important purpose for adopting the First Amendment was as a protection against the government, against the government influencing, affecting, limiting, chilling speech. That's why Thomas Jefferson, sitting in Paris, said he wouldn't support the Constitution at all unless there was a Bill of Rights which contained a clear, unambiguous -- what became the First Amendment.\", \"Well, why don't you get an owner who spends some money?\", 'Burt, that is the worst --', '-- argument. [laughter] Look, we have a disagreement here not just about what the First Amendment means but about what democracy means.  To me there is nothing more inconsistent with the notion of democracy than stifling speech, period.  When a government comes in and says either, \"You can\\'t say that,\" or, \"You can\\'t say it too often, it\\'s just going to have too much of an effect. And we\\'re telling you, we, the government, the Congress, we\\'re telling you we\\'re not going to allow that.  And it\\'s in your interest.  It\\'s really pro-democratic that we\\'re doing that.  You\\'ll like it.\"  That\\'s why we have a first amendment.', 'It\\'s not just talking, but speech is never just talking.  Speech has impact.  Speech is dangerous.  A lot of speech does harm.  I mean, we live in a country that protects pornography, that protects a Nazi\\'s speech. We live on a country that protects -- I\\'m just thinking of the movie \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" because of all the reference to corruption.  No one in this country would imagine saying that, \"You know, a movie that makes corruption look pretty good and drugs rather attractive can be banned because of its pro-corruption in some way.\"  This country doesn\\'t think that way.  It is in the words of the Supreme Court in that case I quoted to you, \"wholly foreign\" to the First Amendment to say that, you know, too much speech is too dangerous, that it can do harm, and it can hurt people. [talking simultaneously]', 'So would I.', \"That's a great question.\", 'Well, let me -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 -', 'I wanted to repeat -- okay. [applause]', \"I want to repeat Burt's last line.  He said if that's what you're doing, you're not engaged in speech. The problem that they're addressing is nothing but speech.  Their problem is the money goes, and it buys lots of ads.  It buys speech.  If it didn't buy that, it's nothing.  That's their articulation of the problem.  It just cannot, in my view, be plausibly argued that this is not a speech issue or not a freedom of speech issue.  If you wanted to say to us, there are other interests you're not thinking enough about, or sometimes freedom of speech gets trumped by some national security issue or something like that, you know, we could have that debate.  But this debate, we're having a debate now where our opponents are telling us that all these ads aren't even speech, that all this money that they find so offensive, which is going into the purchase of what?  Things designed to persuade you.\", 'Or a political purpose, whatever the ultimate --', '-- whatever the aims are, even taking the most venal aims --', \"And I don't -- [applause] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -\", \"I don't think the last four years reflect anything of the sort.  I think we've had a lot of unpleasant disagreeable and, from my own political perspective, outrageous speech, but we haven't lacked for speech, and we haven't lacked for all sides being represented in a public debate.  And indeed that happens more and more with the internet and more and more because it is easier for less and less money to get messages out.  That's the reality.\", \"The -- well, my -- I'm sorry. I thought you were addressing it to us.\", \"Yeah. There is evidence about what happens with respect to for-profits. First, I would say, our answer would be the same, just as it would be the same if a legislation were adopted, as this would have -- barring Citizens United itself -- a conservative organization -- from putting on a movie denouncing Hillary Clinton when she was running for president, because it took some for-profit corporate money. So, that blends together. Now, beyond that, the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case referred to the fact that 24 states, as of that time, have laws barring for-profit corporations from expending money on political matters. 26 did not. Had no laws. Anything of that sort. Unlimited spending was allowed. There was no evidence ever -- there is none now -- that the 26 states were more corrupt, less democratic, less responsive than was true with respect to the 24 states. I'm not surprised by that and I have to confess to you, even if I thought that the 26 states were probably less well-managed, I'd have the same First Amendment view. But the empirical evidence is that it doesn't affect corruption in a state and there's no reason to think that it affects it in the federal government.\", 'Burt --', \"Burt  [applause] -- I mean, I -- I've spent most of my life representing large corporations with -- no, with enormous power called the New York Time, and called CBS, and called NPR. I could represent this -- this is a corporation here. Our hosts here are corporations. The National Constitution Center is a corporation. And it doesn't have blood, and it doesn't have a soul. Stop.\", 'I want to answer that by saying --', \"-- if the government had a law saying that the amount of time for each of us must be equal because otherwise it just wouldn't be fair, that would be a terribly and obviously unconstitutional law. It isn't fair -- it isn't fair to have a situation in which we get -- I want to posit it in our favor now -- in which we get all the time and they get just a bit.  But the purpose of the First Amendment I think is different than you think.  One of the results of the First Amendment is more things are said, hopefully more people get educated.  But we don't limit the First Amendment if people don't get educated or if less is said.  The First Amendment is designed to protect us first from the Congress, the entity that they think should pass laws limiting speech.  That's the beginning and almost the end of it.\", \"I want to close with a story and I hypothetical.  Suppose we had a situation in which a not for profit or for profit company made a movie denouncing a leading candidate for the presidency of the United States.  Suppose it were a crime for that movie to be shown on television, a crime for that to be shown on cable, a crime for it to be financed and shown in either of those places. That is what the Citizens United case was about.  Those are the facts of the Citizens United case.  It was a not for profit.  It could have been a for profit.  That doesn't change what this is about.  This is a situation in which once you say that, look, we'll leave it to Congress to draw some lines, and they represent the people.  Congress after all is doing the people's work in a representative democracy.  Sometimes they are.  The view of the First Amendment of Congress is Congress is dangerous.  Congress is something we need protection against.  Congress is something we have to be really sure doesn't get involved with speech of anyone. And in this respect, speech includes not just individuals but institutions, labor unions, corporations or the like.  So I would urge you that we have really a wonderfully representative audience here tonight.  And it is very important that that audience focus on the underlying value of the First Amendment.  That value is keep the government out of speech areas.  That's what the First Amendment is about.  And I urge to you vote yes on this proposition.\"]\n",
      "[\"Not at all difficult, I've been doing this since at least the late 1970s when the ACLU controversially and successfully defended the free speech rights of Nazis to march in Skokie, Illinois. I have enormous faith in free speech, and I love to try to spread that.\", 'Yep, thank you.', 'Thank you. [applause] Thank you. I\\'m delighted to be here at the National Constitution Center defending a proposition that is supported by the constitution\\'s grand opening words. You all know them. \"We the people.\" As those words underscore, we individuals are sovereign. Therefore, we have no right more essential than the right to engage in our own political Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - speech -- speech about public affairs, speech about political campaigns. As the Supreme Court put it, speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression. It is the essence of self-government. Especially essential is our right to criticize candidates, officials, and policies. Therefore, it\\'s hard to imagine a greater violation of our precious free speech rights than for the government -- in other words, incumbent officials -- to limit our right to criticize them and their policies or to limit our right to advocate alternatives. It\\'s likewise anathema for government to limit our right to band together with other like-minded individuals to amplify our voices. The Supreme Court first so held in landmark cases from the civil rights area involving the NAACP, which was a corporation. And from them, what I\\'ve said so far, individuals and our organizations clearly have a constitutional right to unlimited political speech. So, that means there\\'s only one aspect of tonight\\'s resolution that\\'s really at issue. And that is whether we also have a constitutional right to unlimited spending in support of our political speech. But logically, the answer to that question clearly has to be yes, because unlimited spending is a pre-requisite for unlimited speech. When the government limits how much we may spend on our speech, it necessarily limits the speech itself, in quantity and or quality. Think about it. Suppose the government imposed maximum spending limits on IQ Squared or on the National Constitution Center or -- dare I say, on the Brennan Center for Justice? All of which are corporations, by the way. Those spending limits would clearly limit the amount that could be said by any of those fine organizations. Every communication requires some spending. And since costly TV ads are so important in election campaigns, you have to spend a lot to reach a critical mass of the voters. So, for government to limit what we may spend on our own political speech, including our criticism and our dissent, is for the government to limit our criticism and dissent. And that violates not only the rights of all of us dissidents, but also the rights of everyone to hear us. That point was well-made back in 1957 by three of the greatest, most liberal egalitarian justices ever to grace the Supreme Court bench -- Chief Justice Earl Warren, Hugo Black, and William O. Douglas. They were reviewing the very first federal law to limit spending on political speech. It banned such spending by corporations, and by labor unions on a rationale that we continue to hear, including from our esteemed opponents tonight, namely that these organizations are so rich and so powerful that they could be unduly influential. They could drown out others. But these justices resoundingly rejected that rationale as anti-democratic. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - As they explained It is we the people who are sovereign.  It is there are vitally important that we the people have access to every view of every group in the community.  After all, if there are any groups that are disproportionately powerful in the political process, it\\'s the Constitutional media with their unique impact on public opinion.  Yet we wouldn\\'t even dream of letting the government limit what even the most powerful media company could spend on its political views.  Even those who want to limit what the rest of us spend draw the line at the media even when they\\'re part of conglomerates. But since media moguls have the right to unlimited spending on their political speech, surely it follows that the rest of us must have the very same right, otherwise it unfairly amplifies the voices of the rich and powerful people in groups who can afford to buy a media outlet. So that\\'s just one of the reasons why spending limits actually undermine their stated goal, namely of leveling the playing field.  Another reason is that spending limits favor incumbents and the two major particular parties, which should hardly surprise us because after all it\\'s the incumbents who pass these laws.  Now, our opponents are going to argue, and they already have, that these limits promote equality and integrity in our political system.  Certainly these are extremely worthy goals.  But as I\\'ve already noted, the goals are not in fact served.  They are underserved by spending limits as Floyd will amplify on that further.  For these reasons, please vote yes on the motion for unlimited political speech and therefore the unlimited spending that facilitates it and against government limits on what we the people may say and hear about it.', 'We apparently have very different views of democracy and --', \"And I think there's something extremely paternalistic and antidemocratic  in the assumptions that both of my esteemed colleagues are making, that they're assuming that just because somebody spends a lot of money on ads that we the people are going to be duped and necessarily vote for that person?  Or if information gets out that somebody has received a lot of campaign contributions and is voting accordingly that we the people are going to support that politician?  The record speaks to the contrary. Look at Eric Cantor, Exhibit A, very recently vastly outspent his unknown opponent, was supported by all of the big corporate interests and yet that money was drowned out by the local grassroots people. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -\", 'But the text talks about \"Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.\" The Supreme Court consistently and correctly has said that any measure that abridges, i.e., cuts back on speech, makes it more difficult and burdensome to engage in speech is an abridgment.  If you are told that you cannot spend as much money as you would like to speak as much and effectively as you would like, that clearly is an abridgment.', 'They ', 'They dont --', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - -- have a disproportionate say, Burt, in all of the recent elections, including the post Citizens United elections, when everybody was forecasting that big money, especially corporate money, would drown out all voices -- even the New York Times had to eat its own words and say, \"These elections have been a landslide loss for big money.\"  We, the people, are not such dupes.

The government is the other.', 'It is --', '-- accountable to us, and we have to hold it accountable by being able to have unlimited criticism.', 'And when we have --', 'We have them.', \"Well, bribery is already a crime. The far broader concept of corruption that Zephyr has advocated here is one that says any time there happens to be an overlap between a position that somebody who contributes to a campaign advocates and what the candidate advocates -- that's corruption. That's not corruption. That is democracy in action. We spend money in support of candidates or issues because we agree with the positions they have already taken. When they are in office, they take those positions. They listen to their constituents. And by the way, every study that's been done to try to show a connection between spending and action shows that politicians are most influenced by their party, by their ideology, and by their constituents, not by donors.\", 'And then the other -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 -', \"That's a completely --\", \"It's not a fair analogy because -- then that's why I reject this drowning out metaphor that's often used by my opponents here, because it is true that if I shouted really loud then maybe you wouldn't literally be able to hear them.

Moreover, it does not translate --\", 'I love being [unintelligible].', 'Wait, no.', 'I mean, that --', 'That could only --', 'That could only --', \"That could only literally be true in what I assume is a hypothetical situation that somebody literally bought up every single minute of TV time so the other person didn't have a chance to --\", 'Every study shows and elections show that these ads reach a point of diminishing returns.

Well, by definition, any political speech is going to be dissenting from either -- from one candidate or another candidate from one policy or another policy, right? You are -- even if ostensibly -- let's say I'm arguing in favor of the Supreme Court decisions protecting free speech, that is to disagree with those who take an opposite position; members of Congress who pass campaign -- limits on campaign spending.  So every opportunity to comment on a government policy, by definition, involves the right to dissent.\", 'And more competition.', 'No, and, first of all, there is a right to shout, \"Fire,\" in a theater if the theater is on fire. You want people to shout it.  And by paraphrasing that the way 99 percent of people do wrongly, you miss the central point which answers your question, which is that only if the speech in that case is false and, therefore, it leads to a harm -- directly leads to a harm that can\\'t be averted in any other way, then and only then may you restrict speech as a last resort.  So if we could show that there was some harm that is definitely going to occur and can only be averted by restricting speech, then we can do so.  That is exactly why we can have laws against bribery even though bribery is committed through speech, laws against extortion. But there has -- with all the trials there is no evidence that there is undue influence that causes this enormous harm that is positive.

Are we willing to assume, as our Constitution does, that our fellow citizens can be entrusted with the right to decide which speakers and ideas to accept and which to reject?  Are we really going to trust we the people?  Sure, many of us have a healthy distrust of powerful, wealthy people in groups.  But no one has anything approaching the power or wealth of the United States government.  Here's what--one judge put it this way:  The government has unlimited resources for touting its agenda.  Those on the outside must rely on private wealth to make their voices heard.  So it violates democratic egalitarian ideals that we hear our opponents espouse for incumbents to limit what the rest of us may spend to make our voices heard. Basically you have government insiders trying to justify these limits on all of us, the outsiders, by speculating, well, maybe some people will have dangerous ideas, or they're suspect speakers because they happen to be organized in corporate form.  And that might lead to some potential appearance of corruption.  But that kind of paternalism has always been rejected in our free speech tradition.  We can't say because speech might lead to a risk of crime that it can be suppressed, much less to an Intelligence Squared U.S. - 45 - appearance of a risk of crime.  And we've cited many examples where people -- it's as inaccurate as it is insulting and condescending to say that we are automatically going to vote for the candidate who spends the most money or trust the candidate who's in the pocket of high financiers.

      "['Astonishing.', '\"no way,\" at least not until I knew all the facts.', 'My very good friend, Dr. Raymond Moody.', 'Thank you very much, John. I\\'ve been an academic neurosurgeon for over 20 years, and I fully believed in reductive materialism, our modern conventional science.  In fact, six years ago I would\\'ve been sitting over on that side of the stage with Steven and Sean.  Now, at that time I believed that the brain creates mind and consciousness, that we have no free will, that it\\'s birth to death and nothing more.  Then something happened.  I now know that those ideas are false.  In November 2008 I was driven rapidly into coma due to a severe bacterial meningoencephalitis which I much later came to realize is the perfect model for human death, destruction of the neocortex, the outer surface, the human part of the brain. Sadly almost no one returns, much less recovers, from a case of meningitis as severe as mine.  The last evidence of any activity in my neocortex was in the first hour, so in the emergency room and afterwards I demonstrated only very pathological reflexes including severe brainstem damage. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - Given my gram negative bacterial meningoencephalitis, which I was found to have, and my descent into coma over three and a half hours, I had at best a 10 percent chance of survival at the very beginning.  It only got worse.  Mine was an absolutely lethal meningitis.  My white cell count in my cerebral spinal fluid was 4,300 and a protein of 1,340.  Both those numbers should be zero.  In fact, the glucose in that fluid, normally 60 to 80, and maybe as low as 20 in a severe case of bacterial meningitis, went all the way down to one.  None of the consultants in my case, from Harvard, UVA, Duke, or Wake Forest had ever seen that severe a case.  My doctors never found a cause.  The scan showed diffuse destruction of my neocortex with blurring of the gray-white junction over all eight lobes of my brain.  No area was spared.  Later in the week, off all sedation, my neurological activity was almost nil. With what\\'s called a glass glaucoma scale, which in everybody in this room would be 15 and a corpse is three, my scale was ranging from three to five.  This was a very severe meningitis.  On day seven, with no residual neocortical function, brain stem badly damaged, reflecting the deadly nature of my illness, my doctors recommended, because I was down to a 2 percent chance of survival by that point, with a best case scenario that if I survived I\\'d spend a month or two in the hospital, be transferred to a nursing home, and die in a coma months later, hence, they recommended just stopping the antibiotics. My journey deep in the coma began in a very primitive unresponsive realm, which I later called the \"earthworm\\'s eye-view,\" the best consciousness my brain could muster, soaking in pus.  My prior neuroscientific view would\\'ve dictated that the next step would be one of no awareness at all.  Yet, it was just the opposite, like the blinders coming off.  I ascended into far more crisp, vibrant, ultra real realms of pure joy, love, and understanding, realms I called the \"gateway in the core,\" far too rich and complex to fully describe. Soon thereafter I started to return to this world, but with my brain so wrecked that I had no memory of words or language, nothing of Eben Alexander\\'s life before coma, any religious concepts, et cetera, yet I knew the entire ultra-real odyssey that I had just been deep in coma, went [spelled phonetically] so extensive it seemed to last for months, even though it had to fit within seven days of earth time.  Words came back to me over hours and days, childhood memories over weeks, and knowledge of brain-mind consciousness of more than 20 years\\' experience in neurosurgery came back over two months.  My doctors have no explanation at all for my full recovery.  Other cases of medically inexplicable healing do occur in transcendental near-death experiences, like those of Anita Moorjani and Dr. George Rodonaia.  In the 36 hours after emerging from Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - coma, I was in and out of a delusional, paranoid, psychotic nightmare that was completely different, not even in the same ballpark, when compared to the ultra-reality of the deep-coma experience in the gateway in the core. Those experiences deep in coma seem almost seem to weigh too real to be real. My doctor\\'s believing that the brain creates consciousness, and knowing the destruction they had seen in my brain, had told me that I could not have had any such experience in the depth of coma, and therefore just to forget about it. I knew I\\'d experienced something and sensed that it had to do with the fundamental flaw in the models of consciousness and the -- and the role of the neocortex. Early on, I tried to explain all of this as a brain-based phenomenon based on my old paradigm, writing it up as a report for the neuroscience literature. It\\'s important that when I was emerging from that coma, I saw six faces at the very end. And these were faces that were very important in helping me to realize that the entire coma experience happened between Days 1 and 5 of my coma, and not at the very end. Over those weeks of recording my experience after coma, I also began to talk with my doctors and review my medical records, especially neurological examinations and the scans, and came to realize just how deathly ill I was and how there was no way that such an ultra-real crisp and vibrant experience could have happened in my physical brain. Modern neuroscientific ideas of the neocortex and consciousness would dictate that I should have experienced nothing at all beyond that earthworm\\'s eye view. I wrote the entire experience down, 20,000 words that I wrote over six weeks, before I read anything about near death experiences. I have never read that literature before. Initially, I was very worried that the memories would fade. Those memories are as sharp today as when they happened. Memories of the delusional paranoid psychotic nightmare that occurred over those 36 hours after I came out of coma faded within weeks. Very different origin. I had never read NDE literature before, and was shocked to find that the experience seemed hyperreal in over half of NDE accounts, and the memories do not fade like those of hallucinations, dreams, confabulations, or drug effects. People recount their own NDE stories to me by the hundreds, usually starting -- I\\'d never told anyone this before, but even from over 50 years ago, as if they happened yesterday, I came to see that the similarities in the NDE and afterlife literature far outweighed the differences. And the commonalities across cultures, beliefs, continents, and millennia indicate an underlying constant reality of that realm. Many of the petty differences are due to our being so restricted by our earthly language. This is not like we\\'re describing a Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - trip to Disneyland. Personal biases and religious beliefs might taint the telling of those stories. But the core similarities remain striking.', '[inaudible] --', \"Well, I think the important thing to point out is I get asked to give a lot of talks at medical groups, neurosurgery and other surgical groups, physician groups, because they realize the power of the medical situation.  And I think this is what certainly grabbed me and challenged me within weeks after my coma is my knowing mybrain mind consciousness came back, and I started to review the records to reveal just how sick I was.  I think the problem is that any other reason for being in deep coma, I probably would have been stuck because usually if there's some part of the neocortex that's still working, you could make an argument that that part was part of the process of putting it all together. But I think the important thing to point out is, with my neocortex so badly damaged, it became very difficult to try and come up with a way to explain how this very rich, elaborate set of memories occurred.\", \"Well, it was a very real experience that had no way of occurring in my physical brain.

And I think that that mystery, to my satisfaction, has not really been solved in a way that says that the concerns of people like de Broglie and Dirac, Einstein, Bohr, and others, that they were trying to understand how consciousness influenced them.\", 'Well, I believe at some point science can be very useful at determining a lot of this.', 'I think that -- in my view, this is all about how understanding the true nature of consciousness, soul and spirit, has a lot to do with helping to take physics to the next level in terms of understanding --', 'Well, I would say the --', 'Well, the interesting thing to me in looking back on it is the fact that, you know, I started for a very long time in what I call this \"earthworm eye-view,\" a very primitive, coarse, unresponsive realm that had absolutely no kind of interactivity to it, and yet I remember that prolonged period.

There are tremendous examples of people encountering souls of departed loved ones, learning information that they couldn't possibly learn in any other way.  You had said earlier that there were no cases of any of these memories being generated when the brain was out, and yet there are examples of that, where the brain -- people under deep anesthesia, with complete circulatory arrest, things like that, where they do have some astonishing stories of getting information that it doesn't seem to be any other way that they could have gotten it.

It shows that we have a long way to go in beginning to understand anything about consciousness and that the model that brain creates consciousness and that we can only know things locally with our connected senses is completely false and disproven by a lot of scientists, not just in that book, and those who participated in that, but in multiple other books.

[laughter]', 'Well, I would like to go back to what Sean had said about how consciousness is very confusing to us as is quantum mechanics.  And I would put out there, I think they\\'re related. There\\'s a reason why they\\'re both so confusing. And that\\'s -- you can chuckle, but in fact, that\\'s what drove brilliant people like Einstein and others into mysticism.  And in fact, I would say that that mystery has only gotten much deeper over time.  We have not answered that at all.  In support of my claim Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 - earlier about brain damage allowing enhanced function, which really goes against the materialist model that Steven talked about earlier, I point out two very common examples in clinical practice; acquired savant syndromes, in which strobe brain trauma, autism, can allow super human mental function, something that\\'s often seen, that certainly has no explanation from the brain makes mind model; and also terminal lucidity, in which demented elderly patients often have periods of great clarity, especially around the time that they are encountering souls of departed loved ones that are there to escort them over.  And I would say that these very commonly observed phenomena really demand a much deeper model of consciousness than we get out of the materialist models. I\\'ll point out that Dr. Wilder Penfield wrote a book in 1975, \"The Conscious Mind.\"  He probably still holds the record for having stimulated the brain in awake patients more than any other neurosurgeon.  And never once did he duplicate any kind of situation of free will.  He concluded very strongly that the mind consciousness is not created in the physical brain.  And I think it\\'s important to point out that the pure materialism fails.  It\\'s a hard problem of consciousness and at the enigma of quantum mechanics, that the brain actually confines and limits consciousness, that science acknowledging consciousness, soul and the spirit becomes much stronger than the overly simplistic science of reductive materialism.  Death of the physical brain and body is not final. Thank you.']\n",
      "[\"No, I'm -- I was not -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 -\", 'Yes.  I was not religious.  I got interested in the afterlife question at age 18 when Plato convinced me, through his argument, that the afterlife question is the most important question of existence.', 'Yes.', 'Thank you.  Since 1965, I\\'ve had the honor of interviewing thousands of people from all over the world who had near-death experiences.  And unless you\\'ve been hiding in a cave somewhere for the last 40 years, you\\'ve all heard about this, that people on the brink of death tell us that they leave their bodies, and they go into a beautiful light which they find very difficult to describe.  And in that light say that relatives or friends of theirs who have already died seem to be there to meet them and to help them through this transition.  And they have panoramic memory in which they see all of the events of their lives displayed around them in a sort of holographic panorama of which they witness instantaneously. My assessment from 40-something years of working on this, and I will underline that word \"assessment\" is that in the words of the proposition, death is not final.  But I want to translate a little bit to say that what I\\'m trying to say with that is that in my opinion, at death, personal consciousness is taken up into a more inclusive state of reality or frame of existence in a way that people who go through this find it very difficult to put into words.  One of the most common things they say is, however articulate they may be, they say that this experience is ineffable, or indescribable.  I want to emphasize here something at the very beginning.  And please hear me out on this one.  I have decided, or sort of assessed the situation, that there is a life after death. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - However, I want to say anybody who tells you in the year 2014 that that is a scientific matter is not thinking clearly.  In 2014, the question of life after death is not yet a scientific question.  I am not a parapsychologist.  And I think parapsychology is a pseudo science.  So there\\'s a different frame of reference to think about this, though.  And that is that reason is a much bigger category than science.  Scientific method is about, say, 400 years old.  Reason itself is about 2300 years old, a much bigger institution that includes history and philosophy and literary theory and the law in addition to scientific thinking. So what I am suggesting to you is that the solution to the afterlife question is not going to come initially from science, but rather from, I think, the whole area of critical thinking and logic.  As I look back on the debate that -- on near-death experiences that\\'s gone on for almost 2500 years now, what strikes me is that a big part of the problem is that the format of the debate is basically twisted.  Since Democritus and Plato fought this out 2300 years ago, the way we\\'ve debated this is we say that some people look at these near-death experiences, and they take it at face value, as Plato did, and they say, well, this is an indicator of an afterlife.  Other people Democritus being an example, said, as Democritus famously did, \"There is no such thing as a moment of death,\" implying that therefore what he\\'s getting is that these near-death experiences are just the patient\\'s perception of the winding down process of the body. The trouble with this whole debate is that that format of debate itself is incoherent.  We can\\'t keep debating it that way.  Let me give you an indication of why.  All of the elements that we think of as a near-death experience, getting out of the body, going into this light, seeing a panoramic review of one\\'s life, seeing apparitions of the deceased occur very commonly, not just to people who almost die and are brought back, but rather to the healthy and uninjured bystanders at the bedside of someone else, shared death experiences, as I call these.  As the person in the bed, it\\'s fairly common that bystanders will say that they themselves leave their bodies and accompany their dying loved ones partway toward this light, or they see the apparitions of relatives and friends of the dying person come into the room. So my question is, if the causation of these near-death experiences is the physiological distress and the events going on in the brain, why should the bystanders who are not ill or injured have identically the same experience?  So I think that we\\'re into a situation with this now where really the problem has sort of outgrown the format that we use to debate about it.  In my opinion, we really are on the verge of breakthroughs in the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - genuine, and I will underline \"genuine,\" rational investigation of the question of life after death. And in that context, I think there are two people in history who have more than anyone else I think stated this afterlife question very clearly and the major problems that come with it, Plato being one, who said that, \"Whenever we talk about the afterlife, there\\'s always going to be the narrative aspect, a story, because we\\'ve got to have some sort of story just to get thought about this kind of thing started, but also we\\'ve got to have some sort of set of concepts to link the -- these narratives with the statement of what -- that there is life after death.\"  I think that\\'s coming.  I think that we are on the brink of a breakthrough in rational study of an afterlife, but it\\'s not going to come initially from science, but initially from the realms of logic and critical thinking.  So thank you very much. [applause]', 'No.', \"You know, really, I think the end reality, what we're dealing with here is not a scientifically decidable issue, but a philosophical question.  And what it's called is the mind-body problem, probably first articulated in the West by Pythagoras, but there have been many, many different theories of it.  The one that's current in the neurosciences is called epiphenomenalism, which says, in effect, that there is no independent reality to what we experience as consciousness.  But it's a secondary byproduct of the primary reality which is the brain and the electrochemical events going on in the brain. In my opinion, that's a philosophical statement, really.  And my answer is, I don't know. I think the mind-body problem is still unresolved.\", 'Yeah, you can go to Eben.', \"What I would say about what Sean says is I agree with it up to a point, in the sense that, yes, I love physics, too.

But that doesn't rule out that there could be a state of being that doesn't operate by physical principles. I noticed, Sean, when you were trying to think of some other realm, you were thinking in terms of energy or soul substance or whatever. But I'm talking about something entirely different.

But I think the way that this is going to work out is that what we need to do is prepare people in advance, before they ever have a near death experience, in new ways of thinking about these things. You know, the standard -- the standard objection to mystical experience has always been -- as A.J.

When you\\'re dead, you\\'re dead.\" Then I go on and I ask them, \"Well, how did you reach that conclusion?\" Most of them say, \"What are you talking about in the first place, life after death? It\\'s just illogical.\" And you know, the sentence \"There is life after death\" is a self-contradiction, if you look up the words in the dictionary. And this may sound trivial, but this is really a major problem, because that -- it helps us understand why life after death is not yet a scientific question. Question is one of intelligibility. What does it mean? And the person, I think, who stated that point of view most eloquently was David Hume, who said, \"By the mere light of reason it seems difficult to prove the immortality of the soul.\" Then he went on to say, \"Some new species of logic is requisite for that purpose. And some new faculties of the mind that they may enable us to comprehend that logic.\" That sounds like a tall order, but it\\'s not really that difficult. The trouble is that you have to stop thinking about stories for a while and beautiful narratives, and really get busy with some conceptual thinking. But when that\\'s all said and done, I think that we do now have new ways of thinking about things that are illogical that will open up entirely new ways to investigate the afterlife question. This is not geared to the afterlife, per say. What somebody who wants to go through this pathway has to do -- first is to say, \"What I\\'m going to focus here is on learning new logical principles and going through a process of learning.\" Then, as a corollary, much later down the road, this has implications for the afterlife question.', 'First of all, I want to say that to me to this day the notion of life after death is very counterintuitive.  I think as a nonreligious person I had no background in that.  It never occurred to me, as a young astronomy buff, that there might be something beyond this. I\\'ve been through a process now of 40+ years that finally drove me into this situation where I\\'m sort of forced to say, almost against my will, that \"Death is not final,\" there is a life after death.

That leads me to be forced almost into a position to say that I trust these people\\'s judgment.  It seems to me that they\\'ve been somewhere where I haven\\'t been, and I can begin to put a little picture together of what they\\'re talking about.  So for that reason I would say I\\'m onboard.

      "['It takes patience. [laughter]', 'And compassion.', \"Because they're millennials.  No, I mean -- I'm not going to pick on the millennials.  I think they're great.  I think I've certainly gained more from mentoring any of them than I have contributed to any of their lives.\", 'My partner is Keith Campbell.', \"Good evening, everybody.  So I'm a lover, I'm not a fighter.  I'm not here to fight, I'm not here to bash, I'm not here to talk about all of the reasons why millennials are horrible people and are going to fail of their own doing because I don't believe that.  I mentor millennials, and I educate them.  And I am a firm believer in their capacity.  With that said, the picture is not nearly as rosy as it's been painted by my esteemed opponent, Jessica.  So a couple of things that I'd like to unpack.  First, the notion that millennials are the most educated generation in the history of humanity, ever.  We can look at that from a quantitative perspective, and we can also look at that from a qualitative perspective.  Let's talk about it first quantitatively. My generation, generation X, the forgotten generation.  Everybody likes to skip over us. We don't have complexes.  We invent companies like Google, actually.  It was X that invented Google, not Y.  Correction from earlier tonight.  So my generation, at this point, depending on the study you look at, we range in education from 30 to 45 percent having completed the equivalent of a four-year college degree.  If you look at the Boomer Generation, between the ages of 55 to 64 -- and again, I'm reminding you of the quantitative versus the qualitative assessment.  If you look at the boomer generation, the boomer generation is now around 32 percent.  The very wonderful cohort that comes up behind me, they are currently at or estimated to be around 33 percent.  So this notion that they have more education at this point in time than anybody else is actually not true from a quantitative perspective. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - It's also not true qualitatively.  And what do I mean by that?  The quality of education in the United States as we all know and have been reading about over and over and over again has been declining precipitously over the course of the last several decades, in particular as concerns science and mathematics.  That people are taking tests, that they are taking APs, that they are going to college does not mean that they are learning any better, particularly in an environment where our government has insisted on teachers teaching to the test instead of developing deep critical analytical thinking skills that are absolutely and unequivocally necessary in our workplace.  So qualitatively is not quite there either.  Let's also discuss this notion of what a millennial is.  I think far too often, when we're having conversations about when a millennial is and what a millennial isn't, we do talk about Lena Dunham, and we talk about Mark Zuckerberg.  But I think that they are far and away the exceptions for the millennial population. As noted, the millennial group is the most diverse in the history of humanity.  43 percent are nonwhite.  Of that 43 percent who are nonwhite, 35 percent of them are black and Hispanic.  The black and Hispanic millennials are in primarily underperforming schools, they are mostly unemployed, they are not receiving college degrees at the same rate. And the situation for them is particularly bleak and really, really bad.  I'm going to keep going with this theme a little bit further because we can't just talk about the exceptions. We have to talk about the whole.  So when we say on our side that millennials don't stand a chance, we're not talking about Jess, we're not talking about David, we're not talking about a couple of my millennial mentees who are here tonight, we're not talking about the millennial entrepreneur whom I have given some advice to.  We're talking about all of the rest of them.  We can't focus on just 1 percent or 5 percent or 10 percent of the stars.  So even with that, 66 percent of millennials are not earning college degrees, right? That sounds like it's a high number, and it's not when you think about the number of people who have actually earned their college degrees.  But in an economy that is a knowledge-based economy, where increasingly we need people with these computer science and engineering degrees, it's pretty bad, right?  And it's bad because, as was alluded to earlier tonight, we're entering into the age of artificial intelligence.  We're entering into the age of machine learning.  The kinds of jobs that we've prepared millennials to take, right, are not going to exist.  And so then what do they do?  They're going to end up in jobs and careers unless there is a dramatic intervention, which I will argue we need to have a dramatic intervention, then will end up in the kind of jobs and the kinds of careers where they are overeducated and underpaid.  And that's not particularly good, particularly for a generation, as Keith has already said, which has $1.1 trillion worth of student debt, which, by the way, Jessica, is the reason many analysts are saying millennials are staying home. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - So I'm sure it's very nice to have anecdotal evidence suggesting that millennials are staying because they like their parents.  I too like my parents.  I'm extraordinarily close with my parents.  I wish they could have made it tonight.  I actually have a lot of millennial qualities.  That's not a bad thing.  But I think that financial independence for most of us and for most adults means that we want to move out of the house at a certain point.  And that's important for another reason, not because we want people to over-consume, but because the traditional indicators for economic growth and what that relies upon is a form of consumption that relies on housing strikes that relies on housing formation, that relies on purchases of furniture and purchases of appliances and other things millennials are currently not able to afford in part because those who are college educated, who are not undereducated, right, so the undereducated millennials are in the absolute worst position. Those who are college educated, to the extent that they weren't qualified to get the high-tech jobs, which most of them are not qualified for, as I've already suggested, they're in jobs which don't actually require a college degree.  And so they're not earning enough money.  And this is isn't, by the way, any of their fault.  I have about 45 seconds left, so I'm going to hit on two more important points.  None of this is the fault of the millennial generation.  All of this is the fault of the kinds of policies, Baby Boomers, the greatest generation, and even a few people who are in the Generation X in Washington right now have put into place.  It's the absence of a good jobs policy.  It's the inability for us to work on entitlement reform and shifting all of that burden to millennials.  And so it's no wonder that this generation is completely stressed out.  And if I had more time, I would begin to tell you about the very difficult numbers of 44 percent of college students evidencing or suggesting that they have some level of depression.  Things are not as good as they seem.  Thank you very much. [applause]\", \"So I think optimism is awesome.

And that set into some of our optimism. But I think that you can look at any point in history and say, yes, but we're extra optimistic because of -- look at what we've gone through. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - That argument just doesn't really sit with me, particularly as -- when you think about what Keith is saying with optimism and what are the dangers, and theres a rebuttal in part to Jessica.  And I'm sorry to keep doing this to you.  But one of the dangers with optimism is that it does fuel consumption.  You say that your generation is more frugal, and in fact, studies shows that your generation has had the fastest increase from luxury consumption.  I think I saw something along the lines of -- well, 25 percent of millennials report not having enough to cover their expenses.  But at the same time, they've increased 33 percent in their purchases of premium fashion and services, more than any other generation.\", 'Yeah, I mean, I -- listen, from my perspective, I have a huge number of friends on all various forms of social media.

But what I dispute is that millennials have a more diverse set of relationships.', \"Well, because the studies don't show that.  And empirical data and analysis doesn't show it either.  Again, going back to that 43 percent nonwhite number, I do not see, on college campuses, close integration between the black and Hispanic populations and the white populations.  I do not see, when I go to tech conferences, and there are a lot of young entrepreneurs around, a great integration there.  I do not see it at social good conferences.

In terms of what you can do, I think that one of the most important things, and the thing that if it hasn't become evident to you all, that's on my mind, is that I'm worried about social exclusion, particularly when you have such a large percentage of millennials who are diverse.  And I'm also worried about stress management.  And these things actually go hand in hand because what the recent Pew Foundation study showed, which has been cited several times tonight by myself as well as by the other side, is that with such a large percentage of diverse people, larger than we've had in any other time, first of all, there's  some people who are very, very concerned about decreasing trust in society.

But I just think that it's a little bit misleading, right?  There's a difference between -- you know, we oftentimes talk about millennials and being digital savvy.  Having the ability to make a Facebook post or to take a selfie or to SnapChat or to engage on whatsapp is not digital savvy.  Having the ability to create the button is digital savvy.\", \"I'm not sure that that's actually accurate. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 -\", 'Like a millennial.', 'So I have a confession to make.  Last night while I was watching a video on my iPad and exchanging texts with mentees, friends and my mother, and doing some work for a startup I advise, and preparing for this evening, I took the Pew Foundation, \"Are you a millennial?\" quiz.  And I scored an 80, which means that I share more traits with the millennials, actually, than with my own generation, the forgotten generation, the X\\'ers. I\\'m not surprised by this.  I spend a lot of time with millennials.  My parents are Baby Boomers.  And I really, really like my parents a lot.  So it may seem like tonight I\\'m arguing against myself, except that I\\'m not because of the accident of my birth.  The fact that I was born 8 to 15 years before the beginning of the millennial generation means that the kinds of reckless policies that have been delimiting life chances for millennials today have not taken root and have not had a substantial impact on my prospective outcome.  Things for millennials are not good. We\\'ve let this generation down.  We\\'ve handed them a bad deal.  It\\'s because of our shortsightedness that we have a world with a number of structural and systemic problems that dramatically decrease the likelihood of their life chances.  Our education system is failing, our entitlement system is broken.  It\\'s hard for them to find engaging work in order for them to become full economic participants.  There is increasing distrust and the -- amongst the millennial generation, amongst different groups of people, contrary to what we\\'ve heard tonight.  And so I\\'m asking you all tonight not to vote for us because we need to win, because in a sense, we already have.  We were born before they were into a world where we had greater opportunity.  I\\'m asking you to vote for us because to do so is a tacit recognition that a problem does in fact exist. And unless we recognize that a problem exists, we cannot solve it.  And what I would Intelligence Squared U.S. - 55 - like to see is for some of these infrastructural and structural problems to be addressed and resolved.  So vote for the proposition, not that millennials are doomed, but that they do not have a chance as things stand today. [applause]']\n",
      "[\"Yeah.  I mean, people wrung their hands about me.  Some still do. I think the thing to keep in mind, there's a lot of positive you see in millennials; tolerance for other people being a big one.  But there are some down sides I'm going to talk about.\", 'Yes.', 'Thanks.  It\\'s always nice when people mention \"narcissism\" and then they start laughing.  I never know why, but it\\'s always like a bad ex-relationship or something. What I\\'m here to argue for is that \"Millennials Don\\'t Stand A Chance.  What I\\'m not here to do is malign millennials or bash millennials.  That\\'s fun.  I just don\\'t want to do it. I don\\'t want them to fail.  I don\\'t want my kids to fail either who are going to be the next generation.  But, that said, I think there\\'s a lot of problems. And to sum it up easily as I can I\\'d say there is a major disconnect or major gap between how young people were raised in the \\'80s and \\'90s, they\\'re born in -- people born in the \\'80s and \\'90s, the millennials, and the world they\\'re facing today.  Think about it this way, they were raised with a very inflated optimistic view of themselves and the world.  And they\\'re -- we\\'ve given them a really terrible place to get a start.  Let me just expand on this a little bit.  If you think about the millennial self, these are kids that started -- that were born in the \\'80s, they started school right when the self-esteem movement hit.  This was brought to us by the good people in California in 1982, started going through schools -- the idea was if we can give kids self-esteem they\\'ll do better in life. And the way to give kids self-esteem is not to have them succeed at optimal challenges or have strong relationships, which actually works, it was to tell them they\\'re special and unique and give them lots of awards and trophies as people sort of lament.  So we set people off that way.  And we do have a generation with very high self-esteem, especially college students.  Self-esteem is near the top of the scales we measure.  We also see some of the darker side of self-esteem with that.  We do see increasing narcissism.  It wasn\\'t like it was flat with Gen X and then jumped up, but it just keeps going up and up. We see increasing uniqueness.  We see this with the names we\\'ve given kids, and this is the millennials, but we\\'re still doing this.  I mean, now with our children born today we don\\'t even give them names.  If we\\'re celebrities we name them directions on a compass so our -- [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - -- name them after fruit -- [laughter] -- so these kids are given a sense of specialness, they think they\\'re better than others. We\\'ve raised expectations in young people dramatically, where they have high expectations about professional careers, they have high expectations about going to graduate school, and, again, it\\'s great to raise expectations if you can provide a reality for that. And finally there\\'s been this big shift in values.  There\\'s been a switch from what we call \"intrinsic values,\" which the baby boomers tended to have, to much more extrinsic values.  To give you an example of the biggest change would be something like in the baby boom people said, \"I want a meaningful philosophy of life.  People don\\'t say that anymore.  People aren\\'t looking for their true self.  What they\\'re looking for now is a job to make lots of money.  Again, that\\'s fine, it just doesn\\'t fit with our world.  So if you take that inflated psychology the millennials were raised with and you look at reality right now, we have very high youth unemployment, we\\'re talking about 12 -- a little over 12 percent for people in the young 20s with very liberal numbers of unemployment.  We have a trillion dollars in student loan debt.  And student loan debt is horrible.  I mean, this isn\\'t like, \"Gee, I bought a McMansion .  Oh, I can\\'t afford it.  I can live in it for three years and send the keys back.\" And this is like \"I can\\'t get rid of this stuff because the government says, \\'You can\\'t get rid of it.\\'\"  You have massive levels of competition for jobs.  You have massive levels of competition for those elite education tracks.  I mean, people are hiring people to write college essays now, it\\'s -- I mean, like paying to make 30 grand to get into college.  The millennials are having to put off marriage.  The average marriage age now for women is 27, 29 for men.  You have over a third of young people 18 to 30 -- living back at home with their parents.  Not necessarily in a basement.  Lots of homes don\\'t have basements, but maybe over the garage.  Maybe someplace else.  And yet -- I mean, even now, sociologists talk about this period of emerging adulthood -- age 20 to 24 -- which is something we didn\\'t talk about 20 years ago.  These people are in a cocoon and they\\'re going to butterfly out as adults.  And they might.  We have decrease in civic engagements.  Most measures we look at -- millennials volunteer more than any generation we\\'ve studied.  So, that number has gone up. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - They voted a lot for Obama\\'s first term.  But other than that, civic engagement has dropped.  And generally, the sense of trust we have in the country for each other and for our major institutions -- our journalists, our government, our religion -- is at the lowest point we\\'ve ever measured.  I mean, the country in terms of just our basic civil institutions is collapsing.  Bottom line, and people grown up, raised by us -- they don\\'t raise themselves.  They\\'re raised to have a very positive view and a very optimistic view. And they\\'re put in a reality that is incredibly challenging, incredibly negative.  Some are making it.  Some are doing great stuff in entrepreneurship.  They\\'re creating their own jobs.  Other people are part of what I think of as the great fantasy migration.  They\\'re dressed up as Wookies or Stormtoopers, or they\\'re living in their mom\\'s basement, playing World of Warcraft.  And you get a lot of ego needs met that way and have a lot of good relationships.  But that aside, it\\'s very tough.  And I apologize for being so negative on such a nice evening.  Thank you.

It's a very long answer to that because the thing about narcissism is itssomething that affects individuals and something that exists as a cultural phenomenon.

There's also a giant study out of NIH looking at symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder that found people in their 20s, the lifetime rates were about 1 in 11, about 1 in 3 for people in their 60s, or 1 in 30, excuse me.

I'm sitting in class and this is like most of the classes I've been in.  This was at IIT in Madras, lots of bright kids around me, extraordinary and bright. And the fifth minute mark was my transition point, I would follow everything the lecturer did, the instructor did until the fifth minute mark, and then at the fifth minute mark I would lose the professor.  And I would look at all -- and everybody seemed to be following the professor, but I would've lost the professor and then spent the remaining hour simply scrambling taking notes, completely -- I just lost the professor, scrambling taking down every word with no idea what is going on.  I wonder how many of you in the audience have felt like that in a classroom.  I won't ask for a show of hands, I just want you to think about it. I certainly felt oh my god, everybody around me knows what's going on, what's up with me?  Our education system, this whole system of the lecture and getting together a lot more students in the classroom really is based on the factory model of education. Get a whole bunch of people sitting in a classroom and then you have a person lecturing at them.  It's a very, very efficient system, it started a thousand years ago, and this university below me is still standing, it's a thousand years old, and you know what? Nothing has changed.  You could wake up a thousand years behind you or a thousand years ahead and absolutely nothing has changed.  Everything has changed around us, but the university education system hasn't.  Our communication is different.  We don't have to yell across a continent.  We have smartphones.  Our medical system has changed.  We don't have to hit somebody on the head to knock them unconscious and operate very quickly.  We have laparoscopy today, but education system hasn't changed.  We can fly from one continent to another, communicate in all kinds of ways, but our education system hasn't changed.  Dont you believe it is important?  We can do -- the online education of today is very different from my grandfather's online education.  It's completely different today. In this new system we can use self-based learning.  Just imagine I can watch a video of an instructor.  I can pause the video.  I can rewind the video.  Not once, but six times. Heck, I can even mute the professor. [laughter] This self-based system allows me to learn at my own pace.  I wish I had that when I was an undergraduate student.  Another thing, I would submit my homework and I would Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - get the graded homework back two weeks later if I was lucky.  I still haven't gotten some homework back 32 years later. [laughter] No feedback.  The feedback came too late.  I wasn't interested in the feedback when it came late.  But in online learning today, if you go onto edX.org or one of the MOOC platforms, feedback is instantaneous.  We can grade all kinds of questions, equations we can even grade essays, believe it or not.  So that feedback comes instantly.  I can get a -- when something's wrong I can think about it, fix it.  I can learn. In fact, I learn the most when something is wrong say hey, what do I do here?  I can try to fix it.  Instant feedback is critical.  In the many, many studies education researchers have known this for 40 years.  Study Chen in 2003 showed that if you apply instant feedback students learn better.  If you dont provide instant feedback they dont learn as well.  We also do another thing, we use active learning.  Again, these ideas are old ideas, we've just not applied them.  Theres a very famous paper by Craik and Lockhart talked about active learning.  Heck, just go back to Socrates.  It's a Socratic method.  You know, you teach by asking questions.  So now what we can do is we can interweave videos with interactive exercises.  So you watch a video at your own pace then you go answer a question to see if you've learned the material or not.  This is mastery learning. If you haven't quite gotten it you go back and review the video or the materials, you come back and you try it again.  So this way you dont face forward until you have picked up and really learned the material. And studies like the Craik and Lockhart study from as early as 72 has shown that this, again, improves learning outcomes.  So online learning today incorporates all of these principles and is completely different from what it was before.  We can even bring gamification to our system.  We can do online labs, check out the demo course on edX, its called Demo 101.  We have online labs in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics. You can play around and bring gamification into the picture.  Our millennial generation is completely different.  Just two weeks ago I remember walking past my daughter's room, she's 14, and she was lying in bed.  She's got three screens in front of her.  Okay, on one screen she was doing physics.  On the second screen, she swiped my iPad, and she's watching Netflix, and on her third screen, she was WhatsApp-ing, now, whatever that is, with her friends.  It's not tweeting anymore.  It's WhatsApping with her friends.  And they learn differently.  The millennial generation is able to do these things. And then in the classroom, you still need that.  You interact with each other, learn the soft skills and so on and so forth. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - But they can get all the content and so on completely online if that's how they want to learn.  They want gamification, they want engagement, not the same old boring lecture where they lost the professor after the first minute everywhere. Everybody should really have a high-quality education.  And with online learning, I can really bring this to the classroom as well.  And bringing online learning to create the blended model of learning. In an experiment we did with San Jose State University, they used their online material in class to create the blended model.  Students would watch videos, interactive exercises in this active learning model before they came to class.  And in class, they would ask questions of the professor, interact with other students and learn  soft skills and collaboration.  But a big part was online.  And here they demonstrated that traditionally, the students were -- 60 percent of the students would pass the course, 40 percent would fail.  In this blended model at San Jose State using our material online, they found that the failure rate fell to 9 percent.\", \"I think the big difference this time around is twofold, one is interactivity.  And the second big one is exactly the point that my opponents are making, which we can bring online, and it's called peer to peer learning.  If you look at Facebook and Twitter and all of these peer groups where teens and grownups in the billions are interacting with each other online, why can't we bring that?  Why this scare of technology?  Let's bring that into our learning education system and fold that in how people learn online so that the peer learning is part of the platform.  As on edX, the whole discussion forum is part of the learning process.\", 'So, remember, I just have to respond to that.', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - MOOCs are -- and online learning in this form are two years old.  You're comparing it to a thousand-year-old system which has failed.  The economic model --\", 'The thousand-year-old university system has failed.', \"They still don't have an economic model.  But the point is that in terms of small seminar, the simple mechanisms are being introduced on the edX platform.  It's called a cohort. You can create Google instant hangouts and small groups of five and ten people, interact with each other. And it's much more connecting than a professor picking one student out of a class while 300 other students are sitting there twiddling their thumbs.\", \"Sure.  So you mentioned that -- I think you're making a mistake here.  You're comparing the best teacher -- I would love to be in your class, Rebecca. I think that you would be delightful.  With a class of 10 or 15 working with Rebecca, that is fantastic.  But how many people around the world -- how many children in the U.S. or the rest of the world can afford that kind of luxury, to have a great teacher in a small classroom setting, talking about reading , non-fixed answers at the end of textbooks? We have technology today where we can grade essays using machine learning technology.  And if you talk to the teachers in the California School District, they are saying they are giving their children fewer essays because they just don't have the time to grade.  I know teachers in high school, I know my wife who teachers, they spend hours and hours grading essays.  That is a good thing, and as long as there are teachers like Rebecca to grade my essays and give me instant feedback, that is fantastic.  But what about all the students where teachers are not able to give essays and writing assignments because they don't have time to grade?  We have technology today in experimental form that will be able to grade essays using a machine learning technology.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - [inaudible] not comparing -- I'm not comparing you.\", \"Well, absolutely.  I think there are different ways of using technology in the classroom. Every click is not the same.  And Ben is using clicks in one way, we're using clicks in another way.  I think the point here, the debate is about more clicks and fewer bricks. Can we include the classroom experience?  Can we include the way we teach students? Can we teach more students than can have access to a great Rebecca?  [unintelligible] Can we create using technology the approach where people can learn from each other through peer learning online?  Can we access -- can we increase educational access to millions of more students around the world who just don't have access to the Rebecca's of the world?\", \"I'm referring to all the children and students who cannot afford college or that leave college with huge amounts of debt or that simply don't have access to college.\", \"Again, I think it's how you play the numbers.  So we have 2.2 million learners on edX and of that, 30 percent of the 600,000 are high school and college students.  And so just because 70 percent of learners already have a degree doesn't mean that you are still not reaching -- they're reaching more students at the college age and high school level today than the largest university in the United States. And so we cannot -- so we really cannot say that we're not reaching students in the right demographic.  We are.\", 'I think that I would completely disagree.', \"-- is a rising tide that will lift all boats. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 - Give you an example of Professor Jamie Lheureux.  She teaches at Bunker Hill Community College in Massachusetts.  And what she did was her students did not have access to a great computer science class, so she took the online material from one of her introductory computer science classes, and she used that in a blended model in the community class.  And she said, if not for the online material from the edX course, she said she never would have been able to teach that course on her campus.  And she also said she's irreplaceable.  If not for her and her helping with the online material, the students would not have passed the course.  So I think teachers are necessary.  I think bringing online learning into the classroom can really up-level the whole educational experience.\", 'Let me address the economic --', \"-- model question that you raised.  In fact, I think you made an argument against yourself.  So you said that MOOCs cost between a hundred and $300,000 to create. You're absolutely right.  They cost between $10,000 and half a million dollars to create. But the second time you offer the MOOC, you bring that into your classroom.  The third time, the fourth time, it's like a textbook.  A text-- [spelled phonetically] for someone who's written a textbook, it took me five years to write the textbook. But then to stamp out a new textbook is, you know, is 50 bucks or a hundred bucks.  So repeating is much easier.  And the MOOCs and online education, thats how it is, the repetition is very cost effective and very high quality.  However, in the classroom, I'm not sure what they pay -- you know, professors at Columbia or other universities, but I know it's not $14,000.  It's certainly on the order of a hundred to $300,000.  So in other words, we are teaching -- or we are paying a hundred to $300,000 each time a course is repeated.  So therefore, the existing model is broken.  With MOOCs, we can fix that, where the cost of creation is high, but the repetition, that's how you get the scaling of --\", 'So the first point about retiring faculty after they create a MOOC, of course not.  They have to be involved in --', 'Exactly.  So that would be the self-fulfilling prophecy.', \"Exactly.  So you make a MOOC, and then you have to support the MOOC.  You teach the students.  But you're not spending a hundred and $300,000 each time you teach it. You're still teaching it.  You're still involved, but to a lesser extent.\", \"The intellectual property is very straight forward.  Actually, I don't see what the issue is. The courses and content, it's like -- we've addressed the problem with textbooks and other course content. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 - So I frankly don't see an issue there.  So I would have [to discuss with you off line as to what issue you're seeing with IP because there's a well-established model, and that's the same model that we work for online content.\", \"So the textbooks, the IP's owned completely by the professor and the publisher. Universities are completely cut out from it.  And in online education, I think they have the chance to save the university with universities having discussion where three stakeholders can share the IP, not just the publisher and the professor, but the professor, the university and in this case the publisher of the MOOC platform like edX. There can be a three-way sharing of IP, which I think is the right way of doing as opposed to the textbook model.\", \"Let's be very careful here.  I think we're taking some of the best institutions in the world, some really high quality institutions, and tarring [spelled phonetically] the whole world with this utopian brush. The world is not like that.  Most universities in the world are not research institutions. Most colleges in the world, community colleges in the world, and high schools, and places where teaching happens are not research institutions.  We happen to be in a research institution which is great.  So I think we really need to look at the average, the median, and at universities around the world where education may be the predominant thing that happens.  So I dream of a world where we have universities where professors are creating content and also disseminating content, just that they do it differently.  It's the same people, but they do it differently.  They do it bringing a lot online and so that they can spend a lot of time creating great content which they don't have the time to do because they have to do it every single semester.  So now I can really create great content without a huge amount of effort and then focus on interacting with students in ways that I cannot do today.\", 'So again, I think online learning as we know it -- I really called it online learning 2.0, because  the old style online learning, it really gave online learning a bad name, and I think [unintelligible] different today.  Online learning today is completely different and Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 - you should go check it out.  We have online labs.  We have discussion forums.  The kind of things we can grade are simply [unintelligible]', \"So if you assume this kind of quality of online learning -- I think at the end of the day it really depends on the content.  If a great teacher created the online content or if a great teacher taught the in-person campus course and if the learner took one of the other and had a great experience and a degree, I would say that it shouldn't matter which one they did.\", \"I don't think so.  I think if someone had enough money to pay for a completely campus experience and the same quality education they would have better soft skills, but I think the debate is about fewer bricks, more clicks, is the emphasis.  So I think that on campuses to bring a lot more online learning, the blend of the online with soft skills and so on can be substantially better than anything they have on campus today.\", 'Well, I have to say, you know, there are some great statements from our colleagues.  I would love to take a class from Rebecca.  But this is not about comparing the absolute best that you can get in a particular kind of course against the online learning of yesteryear.  I think we need to look at where is the average going to be?  Where is the majority of the university, the classroom, the students going to be?  And I think in Rebecca\\'s case, she was able to recite the names of 15 of her students.  In my case, it would take me forever to recite the names of 155,000 students that got something out of that course.  But I will tell you -- very quickly about three students.  Deward Mukendi [spelled phonetically].  He came up from a family of 14 from the Democratic republic of Congo.  He goes to the University of Cape Town to learn computer science.  In his first year, his father passes away. He can\\'t pay his tuition anymore, and so he goes off into the world, and he\\'s been working for ten years.  Now that online learning is available, he is going back to study, and he\\'s taking these MOOCs, and he\\'s learning.  And he\\'s saying, \"I\\'m going to get a better job because of the kind of learning that I\\'m doing.\"  I can give you name after name, Omobavay [spelled phonetically] 15-year-old student from [unintelligible] in India, took my course, did really well.  He applied to MIT, and he got into MIT, now he\\'s a sophomore at MIT.  And at MIT, two out of three students today compared to virtually zero two years ago are now doing blended online learning.  MIT moved into this in a big way.  They\\'re blending the classroom with a lot of online technology.  So 2800 out of 4500 students at MIT are now using the edX platform on campus in a blended model. And this is just two years old.  I think if we look at where the average is going to be, I think things are going to be very different going ahead.  So I would like you to think about the average student in all the world in terms of where universities should be and given that, I really urge you to think about more clicks, fewer bricks in terms of increasing access and also improving the quality of education on our campuses.', 'Thank you.']\n",
      "['So we admitted 45 students this year.  That represents a 2 1/2 percent acceptance rate. And we admitted these students not based on an artificial capacity constraint, but we actually admitted every single person that passed our bar, and one of the extraordinary students was right there in the audience.', 'Absolutely.  Our -- the demand that we have received for Minerva has been extraordinary because we not only are tapping a global market, but we also are approaching admissions purely on the basis of the human potential of this candidate and not about their lineage or who their parents are, what country they were born in.', 'We are designing the curriculum such that it is made for the very -- the very most capable people in the world.', 'So a MOOC is a massive open online course.  And as Jonathan pointed out, it is one of several formats and technologies used for online education.', 'Thank you.  Thank you so much for having us, and thank you, Jonathan, for pointing out two very important things; first, that I should have absolutely gone to Columbia as an undergrad because they have sex in class. [laughter] Ben Nelson: And I certainly made a huge mistake going to Penn.  We did not have that.  And secondly, thank you for making such a compelling argument to vote for this motion. The -- what Jonathan put together as the framework was a critique of the state of online education, not even online education, but a segment of online education today, as it stands.  It was not a critique of the potential of online education, and it was based on an analysis of a very small portion of American higher education, these small courses in the most elite institutions in the United States.  But we\\'re not talking about the future of the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - most elite institutions.  We\\'re talking about the future of higher education in general. And so let\\'s look at the facts.  The facts of the matter are that when you look at what even the elite universities do, they are largely about disseminating knowledge, lecture- based courses, the lecture hall, where a university professor stands up in front of a large audience, gets paid $300,000, $400,000, fully loaded, and teaches one, maybe two courses a year to 200 students, is not an economically viable model. And it is in fact a worse form of delivery than what Anant described, the very first version, the version 1.0, of these massive open online courses.  The fact of the matter is, is that all of the problems listed about MOOCs, whether we\\'re talking about who is taking them, cheating, whether we\\'re talking about the completion rates, whether we\\'re talking about whether or not it\\'s economical to create the upfront costs, all of those problems got solved over time.  And even before they do, with identity verification online, with the fact that once you create one of these MOOCs, it can be taken to hundreds of thousands of dollars -- once you realize that the fact that these courses are not completed or they\\'re taken by the people that already have a university education, not because they\\'re the only ones that can benefit from them, but because today they\\'re not issued for credit. Compare completion rates at massive open online courses -- that are there purely for fun -- versus the completion rate at Chicago Community College.  They\\'re both in the single digit percentages.  But when you go to Chicago Community College, you\\'re going there and paying to get your associate\\'s degree.  Here you have an opportunity to learn for free, and you have an opportunity to learn at your own pace with those around you. But let\\'s go beyond the lecture.  Let\\'s address even the most esoteric elements of higher education.  The close conversations between students and professor is small groups that explore subject matter.  Well, turns out you can do that online as well, and you can do it in a better way than you can in an offline classroom. When we first created our platform at Minerva, which is limited to 19 students per course, every student is on live video, we went to the University of Washington Medical School and we tested a very rudimentary version of our platform with a live class offline and a live class online, taught by the same professor, the same subject matter.  The results were universally accepted that the online class was far superior to the offline class simply for the fact of the matter that even though there were the same number of students in the class, when you look straight into that camera and the professor sees your face and all of the other students see your face, you are paying attention.  The professor can call on students and ask them a question and find out what they\\'re going Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 - to answer rather than having them ask or answer at random.  So the professor can choose to pick not the right answer but the spectacularly wrong answer which is interesting, one that curates the course of the conversation in ways that simply are not possible offline. What we all have to remember is we are at the dawn of interactive, high quality, personalized education, whether it\\'s a broadcast to many, whether it\\'s in a small seminar format, or whether it is done in an individualized adaptive learning platform that caters the process of education to the individual student.  But the fact that we are at the dawn means that none of us in this room, including Anant and  myself, who are working on this every day, can conceive where this will bring us in the future.  Here\\'s what we do know.  We do know that when students are given the option of going to their illustrious lectures, even at the world\\'s best universities, there are far more students on the first day of class than there are on the last day.  We know that oftentimes when we ask students, \"Did the courses that you took in your college career change your life? Did they make an impactful change in the way you perceive the world?\" majority of students say, \"No.\"  We know that technologies will continue to improve and will bring intellectual development of students not just among the elite but among students around the world to a newer and higher level.  Thank you.', \"Well, I would argue it has helped.  And I think you have to understand the context. Think of the general population educational level in the 1930s around the world.  What the radio has done, and television has done, to teach people and some of the information has been dramatic. For example, in India, it's something like a hundred million people have learned to read from a program that adds subtitles to Indian soap operas.  And the eye naturally learns to read those subtitles.\", 'Correct.', \"It's not interactive.  It's broadcast.  This is an interactive medium.\", \"Well, I encourage all of you after the debate to go and find our student in the audience because she's been on the platform that not only enables that but enables you to have the kinds of debates, the kind of interactions, the kinds of interrogations of students that actually is even more difficult in an off line environment. When you build a platform to teach a hundred thousand students, that's not your goal. Your goal is not to build a platform that optimizes for one-on-one debate.  When you build a platform that's about bringing the seminar and adding data to pick which two students will be the ones on both sides of the debate, which kinds of analyses should you go back to in class and listen from another section so you can build upon?  That makes online seminars even richer.  So even though we don't have as many students on those platforms, this resolution is about where the future of universities will go.  The technologies are here now.  They will get propagated.\", 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 - Well, I think that\\'s a wonderful Intelligence Squared debate for another time, but we shouldn\\'t conflate the enabling technology with the educational philosophy.  The question is, \"What  can the educational technology provide us--\"', 'Well --', \"She can be there in a 15-person breakout.  So there's nothing preventing the edX platform from having the professor jump from breakout to breakout.  That's just a philosophical point of view, right?\", 'Nearly all.', 'Absolutely --', \"Well, and again, I do think that we're ratholing on a piece of content.  I happen to agree with you both.  I mean, I do think that at the very high levels of education you do want people who are expert in the subject to grade essays.  That has nothing to do about where the class occurs. To say the professor doesn't sit in front of a lecture hall or even a 10-person class and says hold on a second while I read this paper and grade it, that's not a very interactive format.  It's not very engaging.  And so the question is what is the cost structure that is going to be built around actually disseminating that education?  Even in a small format. Even in the scenario we believe in.  What you actually do want is very tight student/faculty interaction, 15- to 19-person classes.  We still opt to use chronology to facilitate the goings on in the classroom, because we think that it can enhance the experience for the student and dramatically lower the cost where you don't need to Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 - build buildings and maintain campuses when you can gather the students and have them experience what the world has to offer as opposed to necessarily in a very expensive, very exclusive campus environment.\", \"And I would add to Anant's point that if these universities would actually issue a degree alongside with that, you wouldn't have 600,000 students, you'd have 60 million.  That Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 - one of the reasons that people don't complete is the same reason that people who sometimes read a textbook from cover to cover decide, hmm, I got to chapter 5.  That was good enough.  Thank you.  But there is no point except for interest right now.\", 'I disagree.', \"It would not happen when the supply and demand comes back in balance.  Right now, too much supply of professors, not enough supply of completing students.  A lot of students desire to complete drop out because we don't track their progress.  We don't know when we lose them until the final grade.\", \"In the future, we'll be able to do that, and therefore there'll be much more demand for adjuncts and therefore salaries will rise.\", 'So I believe that there are different kinds of subject matter that lend itself to different format of student faculty ratios.  But the question about whether or not technology can assist, whether it is a large lecture, a small seminar, even a one-on-one tutorial in many cases is clear.  Now --', 'Well, there are creative poetry classes online.  And both in lecture format and as well as not.  And let me tell you --', \"It's amazing.  I think it's phenomenal.  I mean, it -- but I'm biased in that answer.  I'll tell you where I don't think that online instruction can compare with off line, even though it already is happening.  In conservatory instruction, if you are training someone to be a pianist, training someone to be a violinist, very hard to deliver at a very professional level, not Suzuki method -- very hard to get that level of nuance and personal guidance - -\", 'Well, I --', \"-- I'm delighted to address that.  This debate is not about research.  It is about the dissemination of knowledge.  It's only about the second part.  And --\", \"No, it is not. [laughter] I do think that what you enable when you remove the constriction of the campus environment from not just the student but from the professor is that you can enable much more flexible research. I'll give you a couple of very quick examples.  If you do field research, having a university job, we have to show up physically to class nine months out of the year, does not do wonders for your career, especially before you're tenured, or, like my father, who's a molecular biologist and is now doing structural biology, he needs to fly to the particle accelerators in Europe every three weeks just so he can shoot photons at his crystals. Well, if he were still teaching -- he's emeritus, so he doesn't -- he wouldn't be able to do that, so -- at least in an offline environment.  So research can also be dramatically helped by the removal of physical requirements -- physical presence requirements for the faculty.\", \"I actually don't think it's very different at all.  In fact, you can learn from what these companies are doing.  If you look at where these companies set up 10 to 15 years ago, they created campuses.  Google has a campus and they said oh, we're going to provide everything you want here on the campus, free food and laundry and, you know, slides and things like that. And guess what their employees said?  We don't want to live on the campus.  They want to live in the city.  Open up an office in San Francisco.  Open up offices in New York City. Like, all right free food, that's great, but don't think you can re-create the world at huge cost and make it better than reality.  So I think that's highly illustrative.  I think that the more universities open, the more the university embraces the resources of the world and is open to students, whether they are their students or not, the more vibrant the physical elements of the university would become, like the research infrastructure, and the less university will start to compete -- or will continue to compete in an area like who has the better climbing gym.\", \"I wouldn't want to end this debate without getting into the facts that Jonathan so desperately wanted us to get to.  So I'll give you two facts.  One fact is what we actually know, not about online education, but about off line education, not at the community college, not at a state university, but at our most illustrious universities.  Professor at Harvard University, Eric Mazur who teaches physics wanted to know how much his students retained from his physics classes. So he surveyed them two years after the end of the course.  You know what their retention rate was?  10 percent.  The question isn't as much whether or not online education is effective, is it cant possibly be any worse than the existing model? [laughter]  In fact, even when you give students a choice, as was done with the very first MOOC, one offered by Sebastian Thrune at Stanford University.  Sebastian Thrune is a celebrity. He is the reason why you go to courses.  He invented the self-driving car.  Neat guy.  And he had a course of 200 students in artificial intelligence, and he gave them an option: Schmooze with me in the lecture hall or go on version 0.1 of this terrible product and take the course online.  Of the 200 students, 85 percent never came back to the lecture hall. 85 percent decided to take the online course in the very first most rudimentary version of online education.  You don't need much more data than that to realize that the future of universities won't be without bricks, won't be all clicks, but will certainly be far more clicks than bricks.  Thank you.\"]\n",

      "['Not entirely.', 'The point being that Putin has become extraordinarily powerful at the expense at the Russian people and at the expense of the Russian nation.', 'Take it as you wish.', 'My partner is the inexplicably charismatic Edward Lucas. [laughter]', 'So let me start by saying I\\'m sympathetic to much of what Peter said.  I certainly agree that the United States was not trying to rebuild Russia after the Cold War was over the way we did Japan and Europe with MacArthur and the Marshall plan.  Shock therapy, NATO enlargement, energy diversification, those things that we actually did didn\\'t help Russia, they weakened Russia.  Okay, let\\'s remember what this debate is about.  The debate is about -- not about \"Are we sympathetic with Russia\\'s position?\"  I\\'m very sympathetic with Russia\\'s position.  They\\'re just losing, right? [laughter] They\\'re -- if we had helped them a lot, they might still be a great power.  Maybe, it\\'s possible, they lost a lot.  They had little legitimacy, but they might have -- they\\'d be in better shape.  Peter and I clearly agree on this. The problem is he\\'s debating the other side, right?  What we\\'re debating is that Russia\\'s not a great power, it\\'s a marginal power.  I decided to look something up in the dictionary before I got here.  Marginal, what\\'s the definition of marginal?  It was \"Not of central importance, limited in extent, significance or stature.  I look at global politics today.  I look at the economy.  Russia isnot a great power.  It is a marginal power, and it\\'s becoming more marginal by the day.  I had a discussion with David Miliband, the ex- British foreign secretary just a few weeks ago, and there was a question from the audience as to why it was that British relations with Russia had gotten to be so poor. And he said, \"Well, you see, the Brits believe that Russia is in decline, and Russia believes that Britain is in decline,\" and we are both correct. [laughter] [applause] That\\'s where we are.  Oh, look, I agree with Peter as well that Putin is a sinister tyrant. Do I think that Russia really wants that?  No, no, I don\\'t.  Certainly they like a little less sinister.  They understand that leadership needs to be strong, but less sinister. Anticorruption?  The Russians themselves did a poll on this in the last couple months, 5 percent of Russians believe that the anticorruption policies of Putin were in any way effective.  They\\'d like them to be a little bit more effective. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - [laughter] They would.  You know, 110 Russians presently control 35 percent of Russia\\'s household wealth.  We have -- we talk about inequality in the United States.  The Russians actually get it right, right? [laughter] 0.0000007 percent of Russians control 35 percent of the country\\'s household wealth. Look, it is a big country.  They don\\'t have many people on it , it\\'s a big country, right?  I mean, Palin  can see them from her house -- [laughter] -- you know, Putin can see Alaska from his house.  Alaska doesn\\'t have much sway in the bottom 48, right?  It\\'s big.  They\\'ve got a lot of resources.  They don\\'t have many people, right?  We\\'re not excited about Alaska.  I apologize if you\\'re from Alaska, but we don\\'t care. [laughter] The problem is whats Russia doing with all of that land? Whats -- what are you doing with all of that potential? Ill tell you what theyre not doing is fixing their economy. There have been a lot of companies out there that have thought about investing big in Russia.  IKEA used to make more money per square meter in Russia than anywhere else in the world in the early 90s.  Theyve pulled back. Why? Because folks came in.  They said, Oh, youve got environmental problems. Under your parking lot, theres a gas line.  Youre going to have to pay us an awful lot. We wont do that.  Oh, I guess well shut down IKEA for a bit.  Wal-Mart thought about it for four years, decided not to invest.  Wal-Mart wants to be everywhere.  Theyre your big-box, low-cost leader.  Theyre all over China.  Thats not an easy place to invest. Theyre not in Russia.  Toyota, $28 million in St.  Petersburg because the Russians desperately wanted them -- the Japanese to work with them.  Koizumi brought over the chairman and CEO.  Said, Lets do this.  They said, Well test it out, and if it goes well a few years later, well make Russia the base of manufacturing for the entire Eurasia region.  Have they expanded? Absolutely not.  Everything walked out the door, right? Economics -- we have to say economics matter, right? We cant just pretend that it -- that its not important.  Geopolitics -- here, let me go back to my friend Edward here. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - Youre right.  Tajikistan, Armenia, Belarus -- that is not a portfolio you want.  Snowden -- the Chinese handled Snowden well.  They said, Lets get him.  Lets bring him over. Well grab all of his stuff.  Well learn some stuff about how the Americans are spying on us.  And then, well send him somewhere.  And Russia said, Me, me, me.  Lets have him.  And the Russians grab him.  They said, Well take all the stuff.  And then, well send him to Cuba.  Oh, we didnt think that through very well.  They dont want to keep him.  It became a problem.  They didnt think it through very well.  Again, feather in Putins cap.  Its great.  He can swan around.  Feather in Putins cap.  $51 billion on Sochi.  What did that do for the average Russian? Hows that done for Russia in the world? Its been a problem. Ukraine is the most important national security interest that Russia has outside of their country.  The average Russian believes that Ukraine has been a part of it for 300 years. The Americans and the Europeans didnt care.  Yanukovych wanted aid from the Americans and Europeans so that he could balance the Russians off against the Europeans.  And we said, Sorry, not it.  Weve got other things to take care of. And so, then, Putin said, Ill write you a check for 15 billion out of our pension fund. And, you know what?  The Ukrainian people said, We dont care.  We dont want the money.  Well demonstrate.  Well die in the streets, rather than have to live under that.  Thats Ukraine.  Were not talking about Germany.  Were not talking about Indonesia.  These are the people that speak Russian and Ukrainian together.  So, theyll have Crimea.  They will take Crimea.  We told them, Red line.  We told lots of -- we told the Syrians, Red line.  They stepped over it.  Does that mean that they are a great power?  Syria?  It does not.  Are the Russians a great power?  They are not. Let me just end a couple other economic bits.  How big are the Russians today, economically, compared to China?  Chinese economy is more than four times larger. Thats pretty -- talk about the BRICs, as if theyre all places that you would think about with equal importance. The Russians are losing out in their backyard because of the Chinese imposing their will increasingly economically dominating central Asia, because thats where all the investments are going to come from.  East Siberia, because the Chinese are demographically swamping Russia there.  The Russians are concerned about that. Theres no question in my mind that if we look at the future for Russia geo-politically, geo-economically, demographically, this is not a great power.  We all wish it were.  Itd Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 - be better for them.  Itd be better for the world.  But, its not.  And I think you should vote, as a consequence, with us, and for the motion.  Thank you. [applause]', \"I think our argument has a lot to do with whether or not its power is relevant and useable in the world today.  I mean, Russia is a nuclear superpower.  It's also a sugar beet superpower. That's nice.  Borscht  would be unmakable in this country, were it not for Russia. [laughter]  The fact is, we're not very concerned about their nukes.  For the last ten plus years, we've been most concerned about the war on terror.  And just last year, finally, we said, well, you know, we've dealt with al-Qaeda at least in terms of the United States, just not for other countries, but now we're much more concerned about cyber as the principal concern for the United States.  And, of course, in terms of cyber attacks, the Russians have a lot of criminals.  But in terms of the potential of a government to engage in cyber Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 - attacks against the U.S., that is head and shoulders, neck, body -- it's China above anybody else, above the Russians. So, yes, we're not going to deny the fact that Russia has 10,000 nuclear warheads.  What we are going to say is that alone doesn't actually cut it on the world stage today. We're certainly not acting as if it cuts it.  We don't -- our strategic planning as a country and our prioritization and policy is not as if that is the principal thing that we are losing sleep over on a daily basis.\", \"This guy's not sure. [laughter]\", \"I cede to the ambassador that a nuclear weapon is not a sugar beet.  Look, the question is not, do nukes matter?  The question is, how important do we actually estimate Russia's capabilities broadly for -- since the Cold War is over, Gallup has taken a poll of all Americans asking, open-ended question, who do we think of as our principal enemy? Right?  They probably even asked Romney at one point, right?  They got the Russia answer.  But not from anybody else.  China -- China most recently was number one. Before that, it was Iran.  And the only other countries that ever make it into the top four are Iraq and North Korea.  We're just not that worried.  Look, when Obama came in, we sent over, as ambassador to Russia, Mike McFaul, guy I know very well, very capable guy, former Stanford prof.  Did his PhD with me in Stanford, and is absolutely prodemocracy, pro-opposition.  First day he goes over to Moscow, what does he do?  He meets with the opposition, clearly a red rag to a ball, right?  I mean, we never would have done that with China.  We never would have sent over someone who would offend them that much.  Why not?  Because we care about China.  Because China matters.  It's big.  I mean, there is a major power out there that doesn't agree with us on things.  It's called China, right?  We don't -- Hillary Clinton said, you don't preach human rights to your banker.  That's what Hillary said. [laughter] Right?  Hillary just compared Putin to the Fuhrer, right?  Why?  Because she can, because Russia doesn't matter as much to us.  That's the way we perceive it, right?  And perception is a part of reality.\", 'No, that\\'s right. [laughter] That\\'s a very good point.  And, again, I\\'d focus on the fact that unfortunately for Russia there\\'s been a lot fewer, and they matter more in the global stage.  Look.  I mean, there\\'s no question that the Central African Republic finds Mali crucial right now.  That doesn\\'t make me say that Mali is a great power, a major power, or something we spend a lot of time on.  I think the point that Edward made, that Putin absolutely desperately demands attention, and he had to, he won -- you know, he had a diplomatic victory, a tactical one on Syria.  We really -- we got over our skis.  We set a red line.  We didn\\'t want to do anything, right, because the enemies were as bad as Assad from our perspective, right?  And so we then tried to back off.  We were going to have a vote in Congress, and then we weren\\'t really going to have a vote, and then Putin says, \"Ah, let\\'s have a deal.\"  And he couldn\\'t leave it there.  He had to write an op-ed in the New York Times.  You know, it was the most read op-ed in the New York Times all year. Putin, I do think -- I think as an individual, looking around the whole world, there is no single one person who is more powerful today than Putin. I really believe that.  He\\'s got an enormous amount of money.  He has no checks and balances on his decision making domestically at all.  That is at the expense of Russian power.  His institutions, which had been more consolidated, have weakened.  His governors are now directly appointed.  His judiciary is a shell of what it was -- hope -- what --', 'No, no.', \"Yeah, it wasn't personal power.  I mean, again, the Soviet Union in many ways, much similar to what you think about China, it may be authoritarian, the fact is that you have Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 - a relative consensus, you can't just move willy-nilly with policy.  You could say the Stalin period briefly had some of that, but Putin is governing over a much smaller place with much -- not just the United States facing him, again, China -- China's so much bigger and a direct security threat --\", \"I just want to say the ability of Russia also to do negative things, it's significant compared to the positive, but it's also going down, not just because of the way they've acted on energy but because of the energy revolution.  Russia is an energy superpower, right -- not anymore.  Its decreasing prices in Europe means the strangle-hold has been reduced. All the European countries are now aggressively renegotiating their contracts with the Russians because they have options on the downstream. In the next five years, thats going to grow dramatically. The single thing that Russia really is known for, economically, is energy. And its falling apart. Meanwhile, what, seven years ago, the Russian budget would balance at $34 a barrel. Today, its $117, okay? Thats huge reduction in capacity to have impact.\", 'Ill just say very quickly, which is that I actually think its a mistake for the United States to address as if its a marginal power because youre actually just sticking Putins face in it. I mean, the best thing the United States could do is allow Russia to continue to decline and not really pay much attention -- call it less aware of that decline. The fact that the Americans have pushed the Russians as hard as they have on Ukraine, which was critical to them, had been theirs, and which the West is going to win most of, right? The outcome is going to be worse -- after all of this, the outcome is going to be worse for Russia. But thats not good enough for us. We, instead, have to also stick their noses in it. And, as a consequence, the Russians are going to get more antsy and uppity. And I dont blame them. And were going to have a few more weeks of headlines around this. But that doesnt mean that theyre not a marginal power. That just means that we cant help ourselves, because were always right about this stuff, right? Im sympathetic to what Peter is saying. I just dont think it sways the way you should vote on this thing.', \"Well, just the fact that Putin has made a satire of himself in his own country.  This is not the Americans that started this.  We don't may attention to international leaders.  And we have the last couple weeks on this.  But the reality is you want to see the cartoons that are being written about Putin, you want to see the local opposition, I mean, that is satire, and it's stinging, and it's painful, and it's unfortunate. But, I mean, the fact is that the amount of the rapacious corruption that has been shown by Putin personally, spending a couple billion dollars on his dacha  in [unintelligible], you know, the -- we don't even talk about all the ways that he likes to show the amphora that he found that were placed a foot and a half under water that were thousands and thousands of years old that ended up coming, you know, from a museum.  The Russians ended up finding out about that, even in the heavily state- controlled media in Russia, and they were embarrassed, and they laughed about it.  This isn't the Americans doing this.\", 'If the motion were, Is Russia -- or Russia is a marginal power in the 17th century, -- [laughter] -- I would vote with Peters side because no one else has addressed that issue but him. [laughter] That is not what we are talking about tonight. Were talking about whether or not Russia is today. Now, look. No one really has defined power well, either. So, let me try to do it. Power is the ability to get other actors to do things they otherwise would not. And theres two ways to do it. You can do it coercively, or you do it -- you can do it Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 - cooperatively. There are also many, many ways that you can get it done -- many axes, right? You can get it done militarily, economically, right? Socially, demographically, culturally. If we were only talking about military, and particularly nuclear weapons, Russia would probably have major power status and superpower status. But on every other indicator, they wouldnt. And if I add them all up, what other countries deserve that when you put all the indicators together? Japan, Germany, the United States, China. I mean, frankly -- I know Peter is going to hate this -- even the U.K. does better than the Russians do. Thats appalling how much the Russians have fallen -- [laughter] -- over the last 20 years. And even on the military side, the United States still spends more than the next 10 countries, pretty much, combined, which is probably too much. And it probably needs to be cut back a bit. And sure, at the margins will be some things that the United States cant do that other countries, as a consequence, can make some hay, yes. But whos going to make that hay? Overwhelmingly, its going to be the Chinese -- primarily in Asia and other places. And yet, still, were the only one with a blue-water global navy. And so, if you want to get energy out of the Middle East, even though we wont need it anymore, everyone else will have to turn to the United States. So no, Im not really concerned about that. If the only thing you want to vote on is, Can they blow us up from a nuclear perspective?, please vote with them. If anything else matters to you, please vote with us. Thank you very much. [applause]']\n",
      "['Yes, there was a clue in the three letters in his resume, which went KGB.  And I [unintelligible] -- [laughter] -- plenty of experience of them.  And I didnt -- I didnt like that.', 'Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.  Of course, Russia matters.  It can\\'t not matter.  It\\'s the largest country in the world by land mass.  It\\'s a $2 trillion economy, and it\\'s a super power, not only a nuclear superpower but a cultural, scientific and linguistic one.  The question is how to use that great potential.  Does it maximize it in the mainstream of world affairs, or does it squander it on the sidelines?  And it\\'s my contention that Russia squanders its potential under the rule of Vladimir Putin. Now, we had great hopes 25 years ago in those glorious days when Peter and I were covering the collapse of the evil empire, that freed from the burden of communism, of the burden of imperial history, that Russia would take its rightful place as a great power in the mainstream world affairs.  And it didn\\'t happen.  Now, I disagree with Peter.  I don\\'t think that we imposed something on Russia in the \\'90s.  I think the Russian leadership squandered those chances with a mixture of corruption, spectacular corruption, nostalgia and paranoia, and it\\'s got worse and worse as it\\'s gone on.  What has Russia got now to contribute to the great problems that are facing us?  What does Russia have in the way of a constructive original solution on the law of the sea, space, climate change, internet freedom, development, world trade system, reforming world finance, ethics of medical research, or on security?  What\\'s it have to say about the Middle East?  About wars in Africa, about how East Asia should cope with a rising China? I just ask my opponents if they can think of one constructive original contribution that Russia has made to these questions.  It\\'d be great if they\\'d like to declare it because it\\'s very easy to know what Russia\\'s against.  Russia\\'s against the EU.  It\\'s against NATO.  It\\'s against modern [unintelligible] organizations in general.  It\\'s against the West.  So we know what Russia\\'s against, but we don\\'t know what Russia\\'s for.  Now, you may say, well, what Russia is for is sovereignty.  It believes in the principle of nonintervention, and that\\'s why it stands by and blocks sanctions against -- any sanctions against Syria that might have some effect on the terrible conflict there.  But it\\'s not consistent in this. It doesn\\'t practice what it preaches.  It\\'s strongly against intervention when it comes to the West.  But it\\'s in favor of intervention, in fact, it loves intervention when it comes to the captive nations of the empire, perhaps the one countries that from all they suffered under Soviet rule, it should treat with the greatest sensitivity and respect. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - Now, I believe in principle that intervention is sometimes right.  I think we should have intervened in Rwanda, for example, to stop the genocide.  But I think it was a high buy. You have to produce some evidence if you\\'re going to intervene, evidence of real human rights abuses.  There\\'s no other way of an intervention to try and solve them.  But Russia hasn\\'t done that in Ukraine.  Russia hasn\\'t produced any evidence at all.  It asserts things, but it hasn\\'t invoked international human rights organizations, it hasn\\'t tried to negotiate with the Ukrainian government.  Its intervention in Ukraine is decried by the very people it aims to help.  We have the Russian Philological Society in eastern Ukraine appealing to Putin to hold back.  We have all the Jewish organizations and all the chief rabbis writing an open letter to Putin saying, please don\\'t do this.  So he doesn\\'t produce evidence.  He doesn\\'t produce arguments.  He doesn\\'t like engaging with the mainstream of the way the world works because he knows those arguments are phony, and the evidence is empty, and his chances are slim. I\\'d just like to -- as my opponents over there have been rather silent, to give them another question.  Can you name one European country, one democracy that thinks what Russia is doing is right.  In fact, okay, further, can you name one real friend that Russia has, a country that is friends with Russia because it wants to be, not because it has to be.  So don\\'t count Tajikistan, which has Russian troops on its territory.  Don\\'t count Armenia, which was arm-twisted into abandoning its deal with the European Union.  Don\\'t count Belarus which was strangled with the gas pipeline.  Name a normal country, a country -- [laughter]  name a country, a country which actually says, yes, Russia, we share your views.  We like you.  Please don\\'t mention Bashir Assad in Syria or Venezuela.  Name a respectable country that is actually -- [laughter]  -- that actually likes Russia and says, \"Good job, Vladimir, we really like it.  Russia is a marginal power, and it\\'s marginalized itself. It\\'s not the West.  We showered Yeltsin\\'s Russia with money.  Misfit, stolen  and wasted, but we tried.  We brought Russia into the G8.  We set up the NATO Russia council.  We brought Russia into the European security architect, the council of Europe, the OSC, all these organizations.  And it hasn\\'t worked because Russia doesn\\'t want to be in the mainstream.  Russia doesn\\'t like having responsibilities.  It doesn\\'t like having rules.  It Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - doesn\\'t like respecting other countries\\' rights.  It likes doing things its own way, and that\\'s a terrible misfortune for Russia\\'s neighbors, and it\\'s a terrible misfortune for the -- for the people of Russia.  Now, I don\\'t want to intrude too much on private grief, but I\\'d just like to ask you to share -- spare a thought for a moment for our opponents here, because they would love to believe that Putin had done something right, that maybe he\\'d sort of modernized Russia, he\\'d sort of stabilized Russia.  He\\'d maybe repaired Russia\\'s infrastructure, that he\\'d made Russia a power that could be respected, and it hasn\\'t happened. The Putin years have been 14 years of terrible missed opportunity.  More than a trillion dollars of excess oil and gas revenues came flooding into the coffers of the Russian federation.  At the end of it, you still can\\'t drive from one end of Russia to the other. But who\\'s to blame for that?  Not the West, not the outside world.  You have to blame the crooks, the thugs, the spooks and the cronies who have been misruling Russia, losing of tens of billions dollars a year, sometimes I admit with our complicity, laundered in the city of London, in Austria, maybe even New York, who knows?  It\\'s been a catastrophe.  We should not approach this debate in some kind of tale of sneering triumphalism.  It\\'s not that we\\'re pleased that Russia\\'s on the sidelines.  It\\'s a tragedy. We need Russia to be playing a role in the mainstream of world policies, in the mainstream of world affairs, and it\\'s not happening.  One day maybe it will.  But for the time being, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is a marginal power.', \"Well, as I said, almost my opening words, Russia is a nuclear superpower.  It's worth bearing in mind, of course, that having the nuclear war heads is one thing, and delivering them is another.  And the record of the Russian Navy, of building new strategic submarines is pretty -- pretty patchy, even by the lamentable standards of Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - defense procurement contracts worldwide.  And there's something slightly comic about seeing the old bear bombers which look like something out of Dr. Strangelove lumbering up to Guam and other places in NATO air space to try and provoke us and scare us. And you kind of wonder if the rubber bands and gaffer tape or duct tape is still holding it together all right.  I worry about the security of the Soviet -- Russian -- ex-Soviet and now Russianits catching--\", \"-- of a nuclear arsenal.  But I just want to -- also, if I may, just pick up on one -- I don't really --\", \"Well, it's there in the sense that if Putin goes mad or even madder, yes, he can do a Dr. Strangelove, and he can blow the world up, and that is indeed something to worry about.  But I think you have to ask, how does he use that power?  What is he using that power for?  How does he take that power and put Russia at the center of world affairs. Is he helping, for example, to deal with nonproliferation.  That would be a really good thing for a nuclear superpower to do, to try to make sure we deal with nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, maybe put pressure on North Korea so that they don't develop their nuclear. That's what a responsible, what a mainstream nuclear power would do.  Russia's not involved in that.  On the contrary, it's actually constantly threatening to sell advanced [unintelligible] systems to Iran which will give the Iranians more time and more protection for their nuclear program.  They certainly played no role in helping to --\", '-- deal with North Korea.', \"When I was reading up for this debate, I came across a particularly good quote which I think exemplifies a very important point.  It goes like this:  The idea that you can intervene in another country because you don't like its regime is wrong, dangerous, and should be opposed.  That is why I like Vladimir Putin.  That's what Peter Hitchens said in his talk at Bristol.  It's very interesting.  Everyone's in favor of this until you come to a case you don't like.  And I think the idea that you can just dismiss Ukraine as an artificial country is extraordinary.  And I wonder how -- is anyone in the audience here from Ukraine, by the way?  Yeah, do you think that it's a marginal country?  Do you think Ukraine is a real country?  Yes, you do.  You're nodding.  You think so too. [laughter]\", \"I'm not.  But I will give way to you.  I want to get --\", '-- to discussing more important --', 'Well, Russia\\'s clearly a crucial part if you are living in Crimea right now, and if you\\'re worried about the security of Ukraine.  But Russia\\'s not a crucial part on all the stuff that we would be doing if Russia wasn\\'t being such a nuisance.  And I think this exemplifies what Putin does.  He craves attention.  He longs to be able to say, to the Russian people, I\\'m standing toe to toe with the United States.  All these foreign leaders are calling me. I\\'m really important.  And it\\'s almost a behavior of a sort of disturbed adolescent.  He\\'s just sort of, you know, locking himself in the bedroom because he loves hearing the grownups pounding on the door and saying, \"Don\\'t play with those matches, \"and \"what have you done with the kitchen knife?\" Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - [laughter] It\\'s deranged delusional behavior from somebody who doesn\\'t understand that the world has changed.', \"He's -- perhaps -- just a moment.  These are tactical triumphs.  They're strategic blunders.  He's marginalizing Russia and leaving out of the mainstream on the margins of everything that actually matters in the world.\", \"Just two very quick points.  First of all, I think I -- it's easy to have a negative impact in the world.  You can do negative things very quick.  Kill all your own people, pollute the environment, do horrible things.  What we're arguing is that Russia doesn't make a positive impact, and that's the sign of a country of that matters.  It's not the ability to be a nuisance, it's the ability to have a positive impact.  I  just want to pick up on the speaker said about European natural gas.  It's absolutely true.  Russia used to be an energy superpower.  And because of the appalling way in which they've treated their customers, they're now seen as an expensive and unreliable supplier of gas, and people are making alternative arrangements. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - We may even begin to buy from the United States one day.  We can get gasses, liquefied natural gas, from all over the place.  We're going to develop our own shale.  We've got gas coming from Algeria, from Norway, and everywhere else.  And Russia's share of the European natural gas market is falling and falling and falling.  It's their fault.\", 'I just want to defend Mary Poppins for a moment. One of the wisest things she said is a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down. And thats very, very useful in diplomacy. If you want to get things done in the world, it helps to be nice to other countries and get them to do the things that you want and make them feel good about it. And Russia is amazingly bad at doing it. [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - Russia keeps on setting out very grandiose international organizations -- organization of gas-exporting countries. Its meant to be kind of gas OPEC -- didnt work. Shanghai Corporation Organization -- didnt work. Eurasian Economic Union -- not working very well. All the countries that Russia tries to bring on its side, the closer they get to Russia, the less they like what they see and the further away they move from Russia, with the result that Russias big diplomatic initiatives just dont get anywhere. Anyone remember the common European architecture? Common European security architecture? That was a great idea of [unintelligible]. Lets all get around the table and try and sort out European security problems. Then people took a closer look and realized that Russia doesnt believe that half the countries in Europe are proper countries. They agree with Peter Hitchens. These are pretend countries that Russia has some kind of [unintelligible]. They can go in there and do whatever they want. And thats -- nobodys given them the right to do it -- with the result that all Russias neighbors are rather scared of Russia. Whatever Russia wants to do, they dont like it, because they know what Russia is like. Instead, theyre flocking to try and join NATO. And some of them are even being allowed in.', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 - I think that the starting point has got to be, where does Russia matter in the global economy?  And sadly, as Ian's pointed out, it doesn't.  It's not a huge -- it does not -- it doesn't have huge attraction to outside investors.  People don't like uncertainty.  Russia is able to cause uncertainty.  There's no doubt about it.  But it's my contention that it's not enough to be a spoiler.  It's not enough to be able to spook the markets.  You've got to be able to send -- what would be nice would be to see Russia doing something to send the markets up rather than down.  I actually have a suspicion -- this is just a kind of mischievous suggestion that possibly Putin is financing his adventure in Ukraine by shorting the ruble, then doing something stupid, then doing something sensible, letting it go up again. But that's just hypothesis, that's sort of the way that Russian decision makers do sometimes approach the financial markets.\", \"I'd say most of the countries in the G20.  But I would also say that even small countries can play a really important role.  I'd say Estonia, which is like 1 million people, is a cyber power.

They have people in Maryland.\", \"No, I'm just -- [laughter] No, I was just -- I was just asked for acountry that is clearly not a marginal power.

I'd say the EU mattered.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 - We've talked a lot so far this evening about hard power, about diplomacy, about military and about economics. We haven't really talked about soft power.  And that's the way in which a country projects an idea, a way of doing things that other people want to copy.  There's a very interesting test here.  Go stand outside the American consulate in Moscow and count the number of people wanting to immigrate to the United States.  It's a long, long line. Now go down to the Russian consulate in New York and try and find the people wanting to immigrate to Russia because it's so great there.  That's a very good index of soft power.  Look at the media.  Look at Russia today.  Russia today is a wonderful window into the mindset of the people who run Russia.  They put tens, hundreds of millions of dollars into -- into Russia today as a way of trying to undermine the West and promote the Russian -- the Russian view of the world. And look at the people who appear on Russia Today.  It's a bunch of cranks and cooks and nut jobs, people who are 9/11 truthers, one of their top presenters in 9/11 truther, people who don't believe that they have -- they interview people who don't believe the moon landings happened, people don't think the holocaust happened, a whole range of eccentric and sometimes very interesting, sometimes unintentionally quite entertaining views.

It would mean that if Osama bin Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - Laden had been born in America, had been planning the attacks on 9/11, were targeted, it was impossible to arrest him, and the only way to stop him from carrying out 9/11 would be to subject him to a drone attack, under the negative of the resolution, the president would lack that authority.  That just makes no sense at all.  Of course what they\\'re going to try to do now is try to modify their extreme position by saying that the president would be authorized under certain circumstances, they\\'ve already conceded in the battlefield if it\\'s an American, they\\'ve already conceded apparently if the judiciary agrees, so they\\'ve already undercut their proposition considerably. But consider the implications even of their modified position.  It would mean that unelected judges unfamiliar with the situation on the ground and inexpert at making intelligence assessment and operational decisions could prevent the commander-in- chief from taking action designed to protect Americans from terrorist attackseven if such preventive action would be entirely lawful under both American and international lawif the people happen to have been American citizens.  This is not Minority Report. These are cases where there is clear evidence that somebody in the past has joined al- Qaeda or its affiliates, has been an operational leader of al-Qaeda, and has participated in the planning of operations against the United States. That\\'s not Minority Report.  Our opponents argue that a terrorist commander planning an imminent attack on the United States that can only be prevented by a drone attack has a constitutional due process right to a judicial predetermination.  But consider the following relevant analogy: what if an American citizen wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with his passport on one side and the American flag on the other took a series of hostages?  You don\\'t even have to imagine it.  Just consider if Timothy McVeigh instead of killing so many children in Oklahoma City had taken them hostage, and let\\'s assume that he had said, \"I\\'m not going to kill anybody for 48 hours until I complete the negotiation,\" but during that 48-hour period a sharpshooter was able to target him, not knowing exactly when he might start killing Americans. Would anybody in their right mind demand a due process prejudicial determination, or would you say that the situation there permits for the use of deadly force? That\\'s not murder.  Yes, it\\'s an extrajudicial killing, but extrajudicial killings occur all the time.  Every time a fleeing felon runs away with a machine gun from a bank robbery, even though the bank robbery\\'s complete, just on the basis of the possibility they may do it again, the United States Supreme Court has definitively ruled that deadly force may be used without violating his due process rights and without a predetermined judicial authority.  In fact, the Supreme Court, just two days ago, heard a case on that issue, and Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - the report in the New York Times said none of the justices gave any attention to the claim that it would be a due process violation in shooting a fleeing felon under those situations.  Of course mistakes are made.  There are -- mistakes are made with fleeing felons, and of course every effort should be made to reduce the number of casualties. Some of the people referred to by my distinguished opponent were accidentally killed, including the son.  He wasn\\'t targeted.  When you drop bombs people are accidentally killed.  It\\'s especially the case when terrorists make the decision to hide among civilians. They make the decision to violate the rules of law, the rules of warfare, and, as the result, the only option put to a democracy is to use the drone in the most targeted possible way, knowing that there might be some collateral damage and civilian casualties or allow the terrorists to continue.  There should not be a distinction drawn between terrorists who are American citizens and terrorists who are not, except, of course, if they\\'re captured, in which case being an American citizen makes it worse because it\\'s treason.  But if they\\'re not captured, if they\\'re on the battlefield, once one signs up to become an al-Qaeda operative, his or her citizenship does not and should not matter.  The important distinction is not between Americans and non-Americans, but rather between combatants and civilians. All Al-Qaeda operatives are unlawful combatants.  That is, they are subject to being targeted as combatants, because they\\'ve joined Al-Qaeda, because they are at war with the United States.  But they are not entitled to the benefits of being legitimate combatants because they do not comply with the rules of warfare.  So, just use your common sense and ask yourself the question -- does the Constitution really straight- jacket the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces?  Does it really deny him the constitutional power to prevent an act of terrorism just because the person planning the act of terrorism is an American citizen?  I urge you to vote that the president has such power to protect you and your children.  Thank you.', \"Well, in the old days, they used to actually have battlefields that were marked off.  And the battles would occur on the battlefield. Obviously, over time, the concept of battlefield is expanded.  Al-Qaeda expanded it even more by declaring that the battlefield was anywhere where they can legitimately operate from and kill Americans.  There's no doubt that the battlefield includes Yemen. It includes the Sudan.  It includes parts of Pakistan.  Of course, it doesn't include Heathrow Airport because we can arrest people at Heathrow Airport.  For purposes, functionally, of defining the powers as we discuss it, it includes anywhere where al- Qaeda is operating functionally, where it has the protection of local people, where they can't be arrested, and from where they can attack the United States.  That is a reasonable, functional definition of battlefield, and we have to adapt the definition to our enemies, otherwise our enemies will defeat us through law fare, not through warfare.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - No.  I --what frightens me is the idea that a law professor would be telling the president that it's possible to arrest known terrorists --\", 'Well, the president already -- I mean, the executive already has that power as I proved in my opening --', '-- no -- let me answer the question the way I want to answer it -- [laughter] -- the executive already has the power to kill Americans if they are fleeing felons if they are holding hostages.  If we had a situation where al-Qaeda established a base in the Smoky Mountains from which they were sending rockets to Philadelphia and we couldn\\'t arrest them because they -- the geographical situation was difficult and it would require the sacrifice of 10 or 20 or 30 American soldiers to arrest them, the answer to the question would be, \"Yes.  We could use a sniper, as we have in the past. We could use a drone.  We could use any modern technology to kill an American citizen who was endangering American citizens imminently by having a base firing rockets. Yes, the answer to that question is, \"Yes.  Now, it\\'s not, \"Yes,\" in the sense of the same response that would occur to somebody who was abroad.  The criteria would be different, but the power already exists.  And there\\'s no doubt about that.  And, Noah, how would you respond to \"What is the difference between a terrorist holding hostages in the United States and the only alternative is to let him continue to hold the hostage, you can\\'t arrest him, but you could kill him by a sniper or a drone, would you deny the executive the power to do that?', \"I think you are prepared to concede that.  I mean, if you have Osama Bin Laden, who is planning these things long-term, and you can find him -- let's assume, on a hot battlefield -- then surely you don't require imminence either.  You require -- you define imminence functionally as well.  And the question I want to throw back at you is -- let's go back to my terrorist holding hostage in the United States, in a place where he can't be arrested.  He's holding 24 children.  He's not imminently going to kill them.  He wants to negotiate over days and over weeks, but you now have a shot at killing him and eliminating all risk to the children with no risk to anyone else.  Would you suggest that you have to get a warrant in order to kill that terrorist?  Of course not.  So --\", 'Isn\\'t the Al-Qaeda guy saying, \"As soon as we have an opportunity to put a bomb on a plane and a guy wearing a shoe or a guy wearing the underwear, we\\'re going to do it\"? It could be tomorrow.  Why is that not a gun to the head --', '-- to all of us?', \"Well, we're not defending the White Paper.  We're defending the power of the president --\", 'No.', \"No, no.  I'm --\", 'I\\'m saying it\\'s a functional definition.  You have to ask yourself, \"What is the opportunity to prevent an event which is highly likely?  We don\\'t know exactly when it\\'s going to occur, but we have an opportunity to prevent it now. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - We may lose that opportunity tomorrow.  So, imminence may not define the harm.  It may harm the opportunity to prevent the harm.', \"No, not in the immediate future.  What if it's --\", '-- in the longer term?', \"By the way, we're not saying everywhere.  We're saying everywhere --\", \"-- where they are and have sanctuary and can't be reasonably arrested.\", 'Not Heathrow Airport.', \"But also, every single act of targeted assassination is then reported to the House and Senate intelligence committee.  There is review.  And by the way, I'm not opposed to after the fact judicial review.  Virtually every exercise of legitimate presidential power is subject to judicial review.  There is no inconsistency between saying the president has the power, which is our proposition, and them saying, but if he violates that power or abuses it, you can take him to court under judicial review.  We don't oppose that.  What we oppose is having the judiciary or the Senate or House, that would be a bill of attainder, but the judiciary in advance saying, well, maybe this guy you can kill, this guy you can't kill, when the president and the intelligence community have information that they cannot disclose.  And one more point that I have to make is that you're so solicitous about al-Qaeda members.  About 600 Americans are killed every year by police in the course of arresting fleeing felons. We do that without judicial review.  The Supreme Court in the case of Gardner vs. Tennessee has said if there is any possibility that the person is dangerous and might commit a crime in the future, if the alternative is to let him escape or not let him escape, you can shoot him dead.  How do you distinguish that [unintelligible]?\", 'Imminence of what?  When the fleeing felon is imminence of escape, not imminence of committing another crime.', 'Gardner vs.  Tennessee --', 'Of course to protect the public.  So is --', 'Protect the public.', 'Imminence or not --', 'Okay.', 'No.', 'Well, the question is --', \"-- imminence of what?  Now, let me be very clear.  Let me put on my hat as a law professor who has been teaching Tennessee vs.  Gardner for the last 25 years.  The law is completely clear that the person does not have to be imminently planning another crime.  The imminent is he will escape unless he's shot dead.  The only alternatives are shooting him dead or letting him escape.  He's committed a past crime.  He may commit a future crime.  So the Supreme Court, for American citizens, has already defined imminence functionally.  If this is your last opportunity to arrest him, and he will otherwise escape, you may shoot him dead.  So Noah, you're just wrong when you say that the imminence requirement always modifies the imminence of the ultimate harm. Sometimes it modifies the imminence of the escape.\", 'Oh, no, no --', \"-- no, [inaudible], you're missing my point.  They have just committed a crime.  The policeman thinks he's a fleeing felon.  It may be a movie.  He may have wondered onto a movie set.  But if he reasonably believes that there's been no trial, that's my point.\", 'Well, not only that.  They have -- they have --', \"-- drones which actually see them doing it.  It has to go through about six levels before a targeted assassination is authorized.  It has to first go through the intelligence community.  They have to have a report.  The reason there have been leaks is the President of the United States has apparently refused to accept the recommendation of the killing of this person now who is on the possible hit list.  He wants more evidence. He wants more review.  He wants more process.  Essentially, this administration -- I'm not here defending the administration -- has insisted on essentially an administrative warrant, essentially a multi-layered process.  And they have been very, very cautious about when they've done it, how they've done it, and to whom they've done it.  That's why there have only been four.  When you compare that to how incautious we allow our police often to be in making on the spot decisions about whether to use lethal force against fleeing felons or against hostage-takers, you will see that we're much more cautious about our enemies who are trying to kill us than about American citizens in the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 - United States -- we should not apply a higher standard -- a more difficult standard to people who have as their --\", '-- declared goal --', '-- to kill as many Americans as possible.', \"So they can get asylum in Yemen.  If they just go to Yemen.  Aren't you encouraging every al-Qaeda terrorist to leave those two countries and go to places where you say the president can't get them?\", \"I think that our opponents have essentially conceded the motion.  The president does have Constitutional power to target and kill U.S. citizens abroad they concede, if it's on the battlefield, if it's imminent, and they don't distinguish between Americans and non- Americans.  That, it seems to me, essentially concedes the proposition and imposes some limitations on it.  They throw out some red herrings like a 16-year-old.  Nobody ever targeted a 16-year-old.  That 16-year-old was tragically and accidentally killed the way 16-year-olds are tragically and accidentally killed on battlefields, and in all aspects of war and the way they're killed by terrorists. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 - Look, I love the Constitution.  I have devoted my life to defending civil liberties and the Constitution.  I, too, was on the national board of the ACLU.  I'm here today to defend civil liberties. The civil liberties of noncombatants, all noncombatants, whether Americans or non- Americans, I believe in a living Constitution which adapts to changing times.  I fear that if the president's ability to defend us against terrorist attacks, even those committed by American citizens is placed within an unrealistic straight jacket, grave damage will be done to our Constitution and to the international laws of war that distinguish between civilians and combatants, not between Americans and others.  The Constitution is a living document that permits every generation of Americans to strike the appropriate balance between protecting our civilians and living within the rule of law.  We can do both.  We can do both as long as we adapt to new realities such as the fact that terrorist groups operate all over the world and operate within civilian areas.  We must adapt. Allowing the president to employ these drone strikes will strike that proper balance. So in the name of the Constitution, in the name of civil liberties and human rights and common sense, I urge you to vote yes.\"]\n",
      "[\"Well, it gives me a perspective that most people that write in this area don't have.  Most lawyers are military lawyers first.  I was a combatant before I knew the law.  I first encountered the law when I was learning ROE in the Gulf War.\", 'I hope so.', \"Thank you all for coming, and thank you to the National Constitution Center for hosting the debate.  The president does have the power -- the constitutional power -- to target American citizens overseas in the exercise of his war-making power.  Now, that war- making power is not unfettered.  The Founding Fathers saw to it that only Congress may declare war. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - Now, while formal declarations of war have not occurred since World War II, major military operations, such as the Gulf War, the 2001 Afghan War, and 2003 in Iraq -- all only happened after the executive was authorized to use military force by large bipartisan majorities of both houses of Congress.  Now, the AUMF -- the authorization to use military force -- in 2001, which is the basis for President Obama's continued use of his war-making power against Al-Qaeda and associated forces -- our opponents will say, was only directed at those that participated in or planned 9/11.  However, since that time, the judiciary, in the line of habeas cases from Guantanamo, has determined that the scope of that authority actually is Al-Qaeda and associated forces.  The thinking behind this is that when you're dealing with an enemy like Al-Qaeda, that is diffuse, that is splintered, you are not going to require the president to return to Congress for authorization every time a new group with a new name shows up in a new location -- as long as they are still trying to kill Americans in this country or kill American troops and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Further, since that judicial gloss has been placed upon the scope of the authorization, Congress -- the Senate Armed Services Committee -- held hearings last year on whether the AUMF should be revised, repealed, or retained.  And at the conclusion of those hearings, they left it as it was and so, at least implicitly, have accepted the scope of the authorization that the judiciary has put on this. Now, once the executive has received the authorization to use military force from Congress, it is then the exclusive province of the executive branch to determine when, where, and how that war is fought.  Congress tells him who we are declaring war on. We declare a war on Germany, he can't go fight France.  But it is up to him how he fights Germany, where he fights Germany, who he targets.  That is exclusive executive decision-making.  And no other branch has any constitutional basis for challenging that decision-making.  And this is true, even when we are talking about targeting Americans. During World War II, the United States Armed Forces killed a number of American citizens that were members of the German and Japanese armies.  But in today's war, we are being told that although those people -- the Germans and Japanese that we killed without questioning whether we were invading or infringing upon their due process rights.  We're told that today, because our enemy doesn't wear uniforms, doesn't carry arms openly, hides amongst the civilian population and uses human shields, in other words, because they undermine all of the basic tenets of the laws of war, that they should be afforded due process rights that an American putting on a German uniform Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - does not have. Now, the president does have a duty, under international law, to distinguish between targetable individuals and civilians.  But he does not have a duty under either international law or the U.S. Constitution to distinguish between targetable Americans and targetable non-Americans.  And as my partner will argue, such a distinction would be immoral.  Now, you will hear our opponents argue that this authority of the executive is geographically bounded by hot battlefields.  You can only use this authority in hot battlefields.  That is a term that does not appear anywhere in either international law or in the U.S. Constitution. And yet because internal armed conflicts have been determined to exist based upon a level of violence measure, by some commentators in some courts, they are trying to impose that view of international law on our president.  However, the U.S. view of international law is consistent with that of many other nations that face non-state actors that have committed terrorist acts against their citizens and then tried to seek sanctuary by crossing some international boundary.  And just as Columbia and Turkey and Israel and even Iran reject the notion that you may gain such sanctuary, the United States also agrees that the laws of armed conflict go where the participants in the armed conflict go.  And because this is an armed conflict, there are no due process rights available. Lastly, we are going to hear from our opponents that there is insufficient transparency on the part of the administration. They are not telling us enough about how they know what they know about our enemies and what they know about our enemies and why they are targeting our enemies.  Now, of course, if they reveal this to the American public, they are also revealing it to our enemies.  And to say that the due process rights of our enemies must be vindicated by telling our enemies what we know about them and how we know it does not -- well, let me say that it is obvious why there is no constitutional requirement for such disclosures.  Thank you.\", 'Expost, after the strike.', \"The motion that we are having argued is, does the president have the power to order the strike in the first place without prejudicial review.  After the review, that's a different matter.  You're right, Israel has that.  We do have post-strike evaluation within the executive branch.  If we want to expand that to the judicial branch, I would be in favor of that, but that doesn't change the fact that the motion should carry.  The other thing that I want to say about your discussion of the boundaries of the battlefield, or Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - what constitutes a battlefield, the threshold of violence discussion that she mentions is from the Tadicopinion from the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia).  And that applies to internal armed conflicts, right?  This is not dealing with a conflict between a nonstate actor that crosses international boundaries.  That was from the Yugoslav war, right? If we are talking about the boundaries of battlefields between two nations, World War II did span the entire globe.  Americans killed Japanese and Germans in the south Atlantic and in China and in Burma and off Australia.  All over the world, those things were going on.  And more importantly, if we're talking about what other nations do, other nations facing nonstate actors do not allow them to have a sanctuary, which is what they are saying they should get, by going across international boundary.  You get to Yemen, you get to Somalia, you get to Sudan, and you're safe.  You are immune from attack just because you got to a certain place, and then you can rearm, refit and reattack.  The laws of war do not work that way.\", \"No, the courts do not have a role if we are talking about war.  And we are not here defending the white paper, right?  We are here supporting the motion.  The government's stance on the white paper and the discussion of imminence is not necessarily the standard that we are asked to meet today.  What we are trying to say -- if you're talking about wartime, there is no imminence.  You are allowed to kill an enemy during wartime whether they are armed, whether they are awake, right?  You are allowed to kill enemy -- positively identified enemy soldiers in wartime -- at any time, right? Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - That doesn't require a showing of imminence.  And the question is, are we at war with Al-Qaeda? Were we at war with the Confederacy when we killed a whole lot of Americans based upon their status?\", \"Yes.  If we're talking about war.\", 'Yeah.', \"If they are a positively identified enemy -- member of Al-Qaeda or associated forces -- and an operational role, right? That's another requirement we've placed upon ourselves.  If they are doing that, then we don't have to wait for them to be on the phone, about to order the attack, because we may not see them when they're on the phone ordering the attack.  We may only see him -- we only may have a shot at him when he's sleeping.  And I do want to say one other quick thing about Pakistan and law enforcement.\", 'Yeah, okay.', \"But I don't think -- well, first of all, when you talk about -- it's not the executive that is saying we are at war.  It is Congress that is saying we are at war, and it's their job so say so.  And al-Qaeda and associated forces, who are they?\", \"In the operational sense, then you're talking about al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda --\", 'So they are saying that if we are going to -- we cannot distribute in detail how we are determining who the enemy is because if we describe in detail who the enemy is, then they will make sure that they are not that, right?  If you think about Rico laws, Rico laws are developed to deal with the mafia because the individuals in the mafia knew what they could say or not say, and therefore not be guilty or not be close enough to the crime.  Same thing here.  If we say, what you need to be to be on our list is you have to be doing A, B and C.', \"At some level, you always have to trust the executive because it's the executive that is given the authority to do this. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 -\", 'No, nothing, nothing is absolute, but I think it -- there\\'s no question the president has this power and he has this power and the Constitution has set up how he gets that power -- it\\'s not up to him to get it, it\\'s up to Congress to give it to him in the course of a war.  And I think one of the big disagreements we have here is where is a battlefield? And one thing that I heard them say earlier and that I want to come back to really quickly now is law enforcement.  Let\\'s have law enforcement in Pakistan, all right?  Let\\'s have law enforcement in the FATA region of Pakistan.  There are no police in the FATA region of Pakistan.  That is not how it\\'s constructed.  The Pakistani constitution does not apply in the FATA region of Pakistan.  This is not how -- so you can\\'t say, \"Well, Pakistan can enforce the law there.  No, it can\\'t, right, under its constitution, the way this works is you have an agent from Islamabad that goes up and deals with local tribal disputes, and those are enforced by tribal militias.  There are no police in FATA -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 -', '-- and there is no law enforcement in FATA.', \"So for them to be saying that we should rely on law enforcement to capture people in the FATA region of Pakistan is ridiculous because it doesn't exist.\", 'I think the answer to that is when they become an operational member of Al-Qaeda.  An operational member means you are not just proselytizing, you are not just giving people religious reasons for liking Islam or hating America.  You can say, \"I hate America\" all you want.  But when you become an operational member, that means you are making bombs.  You are planning attacks.  You are carrying out attacks.  You are conducting weapons training.  You are training others.  And you are directing them how to make suicide bets and conduct suicide attacks.  How do you build a car bomb, how do you drive a car with 500 pounds of explosives in it effectively.  You learn those things, you teach others those things, you are an operational member of Al-Qaeda.  And so, this is not a surprise.  You don\\'t get off the plane at Heathrow Airport.  \"Oh, I\\'m suddenly targetable.  No, you are doing these things.  And it\\'s not a surprise to either Anwar Al- Awlaki  or Al-Shami -- who is designing IEDs in Pakistan -- IEDs are the biggest, most effective killers of American troops in Afghanistan.  That is why he is possibly going to be targeted.  It\\'s not a surprise to him--', \"-- that that's going to happen.\", 'In other words, he gets to build all the bombs he wants until we get the judiciary to say otherwise.', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 45 - Having flown after hostile territory, I have some appreciation for the restrictions and constraints that our opponents are trying to place on our commander in chief and the armed forces he commands. You have to remember that every soldier is an extension of the president's war-making power.  For me to use my weapons, certain parameters had to be met.  And those parameters were established for me by my chain of command which ended with the president of the United States.  On missions in which those parameters might be exceeded, provisions were made for me to contact people higher in my chain of command who could give me weapons release authority in situations outside of the narrow discretion I was given in my brief.  But according to our opponents, even if I had the president of the United States himself on the line, if my target was an American citizen, or if there was an American citizen amongst the enemies that I was targeting, then he could not give me the authority to release the weapons.  We would have to go to the judiciary to ensure that the due process rights of our enemies were not infringed. And while there may be certain circumstances -- they were talking about, well, how imminent is it if we're talking about al-Awlaki?  There may be certain circumstances in which there is time for discussion between the judiciary and the executive branch.  But I guarantee you that there are many, many times in which there is not sufficient time for such discussions and deliberations.  Justice Jackson famously said that the Constitution is not a suicide pact.  But for members of our armed forces, that is precisely what our opponents are trying to make it.  Thank you.\"]\n",

      "['I think they will.', 'I hope that it is not close.  But direct democracy is a tricky business.  You never know.', 'My partner is the very talented economist Rick Sander.', \"Thank you.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Rick and I are here to make a very narrow point, race preferential admissions policies are doing far more harm than good. The very large preferences that are now routinely employed by colleges and universities produce fewer, not more, black scientists, black engineers, and black medical doctors. They produce fewer black college professors and very likely fewer black lawyers. We are talking epic policy failure.  Before I get too far, let me say that we are not here to argue against outreach, outreach is not the source of the problem, nor are we here to argue that colleges and universities should consider only academic indicators like the SAT in evaluating applicants.  There are lots of ways to measure talent, though I would say that race is not one of them.  But let me get back to my main point.  Race preferential policies don't work.  How can that be?  How can giving minorities a friendly leg up produce fewer minority professionals?  Well, let me explain.  One consequence of widespread race preferential policies is that underrepresented minorities end up distributed among colleges and universities in patterns very different from their white and asian counterparts.  When the highest school on the academic ladder relaxes academic standards in order to admit more minority students, the schools one rung down must do the same if they are to get minority students. The problem is thus passed down to the third rung on the ladder, which responds similarly.  As a result, underrepresented minority students are concentrated at the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - bottom of most selective schools.  The problem is not that there are no academically gifted minority students, but there are not currently enough at the very top tiers to satisfy the demand.  And efforts to remedy that problem end up causing credentials gaps up and down the pecking order. For example, we learned in connection with the University of Michigan Supreme Court litigation a decade ago that Michigan granted preferences to underrepresented minority students equivalent to an entire letter grade.  That is, African-American and Hispanic students with a straight B, 3.0, average were treated the same as Asian and white students with a straight A, 4.0, grade point average, all other things being equal. This is no tiebreaker in otherwise close cases.  The preferences are very large, and since 2003 they've gotten larger.  The problem is that entering credentials matter.  Students whose academic credentials are well below the average for the college and university they are attending will usually earn grades that are similar, while some students outperform their entering credentials, just as some students underperform theirs.  Most students will perform in the general range that their academic credentials suggest, and anyone who thinks otherwise is engaging in wishful thinking at student expense.  No serious supporter of affirmative action denies this.  The strongest evidence of backfire comes from science and engineering.  Contrary to what some people think, college bound African-American and Hispanic students are just as interested as white students in majoring in science and engineering, actually a little more so, the numbers suggest. But these are difficult majors and many students of all races abandon that ambition. African-American and Hispanic students jump ship at much, much higher rates than do whites.  It's not surprising that those students, again, of any race, who give up on science and engineering disproportionately have lower entering academic credentials. But what some do find surprising and what is key to the argument that we're making this evening is that four in-depth published studies by researchers at Dartmouth, the University of Virginia, and Duke, among others, and also one unpublished study so far by Rick, here, all demonstrate that part of the effect is relative. An aspiring science major who attends a school where she's in the middle or towards the top of her class in entering credentials is much more likely to persevere and ultimately succeed than is an otherwise identical student, same entering academic credentials, who attends a school where her academic credentials put her towards the bottom of the class.  Put differently, preferences hurt, they don't help.  The difference is not trivial, ladies and gentlemen.  We would have a lot more science and engineering Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - minority students graduating with that degree if we engaged in race-neutral admissions policies -- or at least did not give so great a preference to students.  A similar study by Stephen Cole and Elinor Barber shows that minority students who attend colleges, whether entering credentials put them at the bottom of the class -- do not aspire to go on to graduate school and to become college professors in the same numbers as their identical -- identically credentialed minority counterparts who are attending somewhat less elite schools.  And the reason should be obvious.  Students who get good grades in school tend to like school, in part because they correctly note that they're good at it. None of the results in any of these studies have been controversial.  No one has rebutted any of it.  The only mismatched study that's received any kind of criticism is Rick's initial study of law school management -- law school mismatch, where data is hard to come by.  But some of the very same people who criticized that study are the ones who are actively trying to prevent him from getting more, better data.\", 'That speaks volumes. [applause]', 'Well, I think the example from the University of Michigan is a good one.  That was an entire letter grade on the GPA -- or alternatively, 300 points on the combined SAT.', \"Well, first of all, no one has ever rebutted the studies that I cited, not anyone.  The only report that's actually been taken on by some of the scholars is Rick's, as I said.  And again, some of those same scholars are the ones who basically said the database isn't good enough and then tried to prevent him from getting access to the California database.  As I said, that really speaks volumes.  And, sure, there are plenty of people who have benefited in some way.  I don't know whether any of the people that you listed are among them because I don't know what the counter factual is. I suspect that you and Randall would have been very successful even without preferences, assuming that you got preferences.  And I don't know that.  One interesting thing is that there's one bit of evidence from --\", \"They claim to be the beneficiaries of racial preferences.  If that's so, it may well be that they --\", 'Yeah, they may have.', \"And my point I was making earlier.  One kind of interesting shred of evidence here -- and I -- it's just a shred, but I find it rather interesting.  First lady Michelle Obama actually did a senior thesis on the issue of how blacks at Princeton integrate into society. And one of the things that she found, she polled, I believe it was, 400 black alumni at Princeton.  Her response rate was really not -- not very high, so I'm not claiming this is a very scientific report, but it's interesting.  She actually found that before Princeton and after Princeton -- that was her comparison -- that black students felt that they were just as comfortable with whites on athletic basis, I believe on several social bases.  When it came to comfort with -- with whites on an academic basis, they actually became less comfortable after Princeton than what they were before, which was an interesting result.\", 'Not rebutted me, but the studies, the studies.', 'No, I --', \"Actually I would be absolutely delighted if we just disclosed, because I think that would do a world of good.  I would be very happy.  I think that's a much better solution than waiting and having the debate go on for decades here.  If we could -- if we could Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - disclose, and we could do that starting today, and do it honestly, I think that would go a very, very long way to solve the problem because I think students would catch on and they'd do the right thing.  So if we could decide on behalf of every law school and every medical school to do that today, then, man, we're in business, and we might as well quit early and go out and have a beer. [talking simultaneously]\", \"I'm satisfied with that [inaudible] debating for 20 years, you know.  It's a good -- it's a good compromise if we actually could do it now. But I think actually if you paid attention to the mismatch literature, you're going to get more and more persuaded to our side.\", \"I guess I have a number of comments here.  First of all, on the disclosure issue that we were talking about a little bit earlier, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights proposed that law schools disclose these issues.  It must have been something like seven years ago. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - What happened?  We got absolute deafening silence from the law schools.  Nobody was willing even to mention it.  This was a nonstarter.  I doubt very much that we can get law school deans to disclose this.  But again, as a compromise matter, I would think that's pretty good if we could do that right now.  Otherwise I'd just like to convince you that the mismatch literature is in fact correct.  I very much doubt that most people consider it more important to have more ivy league grads who are black than it is to have more black doctors, more black scientists, more -- more black engineers.  I feel like I'm standing here with a key, and here is the key.  Here is how we can get many more black doctors, many more black engineers, many more black scientists, more black lawyers, more black college professors.  And I just need someone to take that key and unlock the door.  But it's hard.  It's hard.\", \"Well, I guess I'd like to say something, and that is one thing I think that we --\", \"There'd be more black doctors, there'd be more black engineers, there'd be more black scientists and more black college professors if we did not use these very large preferences.  Again, we're not against outreach.  We're very much for outreach. But the kind of preferences that are being practiced have been very much counterproductive.\", \"I guess I don't have a whole lot to add --\", '-- a little bit. [laughter]', \"I mean, I didn't say that was my ideal system.  I'm not really quite sure what my ideal is. But what I did say is that, yes, if schools were to disclose what the success rate for students with that particular set of academic indicators and students were able to decide for themselves whether or not they wanted to take the risk, I think that's a tremendous improvement over what we have now. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 - And, in fact, that's exactly what the U.S.  Commission on Civil Rights recommended that law schools do.  And I voted for that report.  And what's tragic I think is that schools don't want to disclose it.  They don't want to tell students, I am not at all confident that even though as a group we're able to come to a possible settlement.  I don't think you're going to get Harvard or any other law school to sign on to it.  And that's a tragedy, I think.\", 'Thank you.  This should not be a liberal or conservative issue -- and it didn\\'t used to be. No less a liberal icon than Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglass  -- made an eloquent plea on behalf of color-blind admissions policies back in the early 1970s.  My personal favorite among the liberals on this issue was California Supreme Court Justice Stanley Mosk.  As a Superior Court judge, and later as California Attorney General, Mosk stuck his neck out for civil rights on many occasions, back in the 1940s, when it wasn\\'t so popular, back when it could be a career killer.  Mosk called race-preferential admissions \"the sacrifice of principle for the sake of dubious expediency. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - Little did he realize just how dubious that expediency would turn out to be.  Though maybe he should have.  The research that we have been talking about today was not a bolt from the blue.  The University of Chicago Sociologist James Davis had concluded in the mid-1960s that college students who receive preferential treatment would have gone on to better careers, had they attended somewhat less elite institutions.  He wasn\\'t writing about affirmative action.  Back in those days, it was most legacies and athletes that were getting the preferential treatment.  But if it does not work for legacies and athletes, why would it work for anybody?  I am happy to stipulate that everyone involved in this experiment meant well, and I know it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that a strategy that you\\'ve put your heart into just isn\\'t working.  But this is not an ideological point. Racial preferences don\\'t work.  We have lost precious time.  Let\\'s not make it worse by ignoring the evidence.  I urge you to vote in favor of the motion.']\n",
      "[\"Not quite yet.  The court said that there is a public right for academics or anyone in the public to seek this data.  But they also said that there have to be privacy safeguards with that, and we're still trying to work those out.\", \"I'd say between one month and seven years.\", 'We [unintelligible] a proposal to the bar. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 -', 'Thanks very much, John.  So you\\'ve been told that truth is going to emerge from vigorous, zealous advocacy on both sides.  And at my peril, I\\'m going to depart from that a little bit to try to suggest a little bit of a nuance because it seems to me that when we pose the question as an empirical one, is it doing more harm than good, rather than a moral one, is affirmative action right or wrong, we sort of take on the hats of social scientists. And if we\\'re going to approach it scientifically, we need to be candid about certain things.  So let me try to introduce some candor.  Let\\'s compare law school and medical school.  Now, we\\'re going to get more into the Q and A about the actual merits of law school mismatch, but assume that I might, for the moment, that if you compare two students who go to different law schools, one with large preferences to one without, the one who receives large preferences is two or three times more likely to fail the Bar exam.  That event happens after the student has graduated from law school.  And students who fail the bar, as one scholar put it, \"Are marooned.  The law school is no longer interested in their fate, and they\\'ve kind of given up on them as alumni contributors.  Let\\'s compare that with medical school.  Medical school, there\\'s also something like the Bar exam.  It\\'s called the National Boards.  That\\'s taken halfway through medical school, up to the second year.  If a student fails the National Boards, then at many medical schools, they\\'re put in an academic support program. There\\'s an effort to try to remediate and to try to help that student succeed.  And there\\'s some evidence that that works.  So that means that affirmative action might be beneficial if we sort of provide the right institutional support to go with it.  That generally is lacking.  So that\\'s one reason why, on balance, I think there\\'s a harm. Another example is when we think about science mismatch, as Gail brought up.  As she said, there are now four peer reviewed studies that show very clearly that if you receive a large preference into a college or university, you\\'re 50 to 75 percent more likely to drop out of your science career on your way to getting a BA.  And frequently, people drop out of college altogether.  That has been shown to happen when you have a very large preference.  What we don\\'t know  enough about, because we don\\'t have enough data yet, is what happens with the small preference.  Suppose the size of the preference is not equal to 300 SAT points, but the equivalent of 50 SAT points. It\\'s possible that smaller preferences don\\'t cause that much of a mismatch effect and that the other positive effects of affirmative action like having a more challenging Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - atmosphere and having peers who are really talented might outweigh.  So I think we need to admit that there are tradeoffs.  There are balances.  We\\'re not talking about something that\\'s completely good or completely bad.  It\\'s a mixture. So why do I think that, on balance, you should vote for the proposition?  First of all, there\\'s no longer any reasonable doubt that very large preferences have negative consequences.  That\\'s now been shown in about 20 different peer-reviewed studies by over 20 different academics.  And when Ted presents rebuttals in his next remark, listen carefully for when he cites peer-reviewed published studies because those are the things that we\\'re going to care about.  We\\'re going to care about studies that have gone through a process of actually being evaluated by other scholars and have been published in a reputable scholarly journal. That research overwhelmingly shows direct negative effects from large-scale preferences.  And when I say, \"Large,\" I mean really large.  The typical beneficiary of a preference -- well, the typical African-American student at an American law school has credentials that put them at below 99 percent of the white students.  So the median black student has lower credentials than 99 percent of the Anglo and Asian students. That\\'s a large preference. Second, there have been a host of carefully done studies that have shown other sorts of really troubling side effects of affirmative action.  For example, when the University of California implemented race-neutral policies after Prop 209, we saw this really interesting jump in the takeup rate by black and Hispanic students admitted to Berkeley and UCLA and some of the other elite campuses.  Now, why would the enrollment rate of accepted students jump?  We\\'d like to know more about that. But a plausible explanation is that these students found it really attractive to attend a school where neither they nor anyone else thinks that they were admitted with a racial preference.  So think about the implications of that. Third, colleges and universities are locked into a pattern of institutional dishonesty.  I don\\'t think college leaders are intrinsically dishonest people, but the prevailing ideology of affirmative action makes it difficult and even hazardous for them to speak out about these issues or to really look at the effect and critically examine the effect of the programs that they\\'re operating.  To show this, consider the fact that the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, on which Gail now sits-- I think at least one of these reports came before Gail was on the commission--two reports to the commission have shown significant mismatch effects and have raised very troubling issues about it.  Neither of these reports has ever been acknowledged by a higher education leader in America. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - There have been no task forces appointed.  There\\'s been no investigations undertaken. The reports have simply been ignored. There\\'s a pattern of institutional unwillingness to deal with uncomfortable facts.  That suggests that there\\'s a need for reform.  Finally, we have almost no transparency about what goes non-higher education.  Schools do not provide information, unless they\\'re forced to, about their actual admissions practices.  They don\\'t provide information about outcomes.  When data comes out, it\\'s either because of a lawsuit or because someone trusted as a reliable insider decides to write about the problem.  That\\'s what I did when I got access to data on how law school preferences actually worked.  So we had this pattern of problems that suggest a crying need  for reform.  That\\'s why I urge you to support the opposition.', \"I'll take it.\", \"So we may be able to resolve this debate and just come to agreement.   I will agree with Randall that  I withdraw all my objections to affirmative action if colleges and universities will adopt the following practice:  When they accept someone for admission, they also provide a detailed statement of how that student's credentials predict their performance.  If they're an engineering applicant, tell them the chances, tell them the past record of students with identical credentials who have actually achieved an engineering degree at that school.  If they want to go to law school, tell Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - them, what are the chances that a student with their credentials has passed the bar on the first attempt and what their GPA has been on average.  If that information is provided, then you're right, all that affirmative action is doing is increasing the range of opportunities.  What's wrong with that?  The problem is the schools don't do that.  They do not provide transparent.  They actually actively counter measure.  They actively conceal.  They won't disclose data on what they're doing.  They tell students that everyone has the same chance of success. Everyone is equally qualified and will have the same outcomes.  These things are manifestly not true.  So students are accepting offers based on dramatic information -- misinformation.\", \"And you don't have to take my word for it.  There was actually a study done at Duke where a professor looked at the information that the university had internally and went to students and said, okay, if you have this information, what would your enrollment decision be?  And they made different decisions.\", \"Well, I would just say, if you look at the debate on law school mismatch, which, as Gail says, has been the most contested one, it's interesting.  I mean, I published my initial study.  The data was limited.  My analytical abilities were probably limited.  There were about 20 critical studies published in response.  But none of these were published in peer-reviewed journals.  A debate was joined, new articles came out.  If you look at the - - sorry, where the dust has settled eight years later, there are now four peer-reviewed studies that have been published that all find strong evidence of law school mismatch. They all find roughly the disparity in chances caused by large preferences that I mentioned before. There have been zero studies, zero peer-reviewed studies published on the other side. And the most recent critique was actually withdrawn when the author admitted that her results cannot be replicated.  So if you look closely at this, you see a pretty overwhelming pattern. Now, I would slightly modify Gail's statement that there are many good studies that say that preferences can have net positive effects.  But when those studies are examined, they're generally focusing on secondary outcomes like graduation rates.  The things that we're talking about with mismatch are things like learning, competition, grades, attrition from a science track and so on, things that are directly related to mismatch.  Graduation rates, for example, are more manipulable by university policies.  A law school or college can decide  they want to get their graduation rate up to 97 percent. So if you look at some secondary outcomes, I think the debate is more mixed, but it really is overwhelming how on the literature of primary mismatch effects, it's essentially undisputed. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -\", \"So, you know, I mean, it's not a bad thing if we end up agreeing by, you know, 7:00.  If -- [laughter]\", 'We\\'re arguing that affirmative action does more harm than good, not that it has to do more harm than good.  We\\'re saying that if you fix it, it could work pretty well.  And you started out basically acknowledging that you\\'re against stupid affirmative action.  So in a way the scope of the agreement, the debate here, is \"What\\'s stupid affirmative action?\" And that goes to this issue about kind of, you know, what do we mean by preferences or Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 - what do we mean by affirmative action?  I mean, I hear what you\\'re saying, Ted, that racial propositions is a loaded term, right? And I try not to use -- I think we use a bunch in my remarks -- the preferences received by legacies are much smaller on average than preferences based on race.  Excuse me. Preferences received by women are virtually nonexistent.  I mean, that\\'s always been a big theme of affirmative action, that is that women are under the tent as well.  But historically that has been very small.  I mean, there have been important things in terms of trying to expand the path of access for women.  But in terms of actual admissions preferences, that\\'s been a -- it\\'s been, essentially, a trivial phenomenon.  And class has not been a significant subject of preferences, okay? The typical college gives something like 20 or 30 times the amount of weight to race as they do to class -- if they consider class at all.  So, one of the reasons that race keeps popping up in the mismatch literature is because that\\'s where the really large preferences are, and that\\'s where the problem seems --', \"Because the pervasive tendency of selective institutions is to grossly go overboard.  The focus of what schools do, the way that they set their goals is not based on how much of a preference should we use to maximize the width of the pipeline, to sort of maximize the aggregate beneficial social good?  It's, how do I have enough cosmetic diversity in my entering freshman class so that I'm not going to get hassled? That's the way the university presidents are usually thinking about this.  And that is totally the wrong question.  They ought to be thinking about what the effects are.  And so, because we're in this mindset where we're asking the wrong questions, or setting it up to do things that it's not well-engineered to do, we end up getting preferences that Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 - are whatever are needed to achieve those cosmetic goals.  And it ends up causing more harm than good.\", 'If you look at --', '[inaudible] -- preferences of professional schools -- or at the top 200 select schools.', 'If you look at -- if you look at three big things that keep coming up --', 'Okay.', 'Racial preference, right. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 -', \"I think that in the early years, in the 1960s and '70s, it was important to do whatever we could.  We had to convince minorities that the doors that had been closed were now opening.  So I would set aside that period.  But if you want to see what would be the effect now or in recent decades, look at the effect of Prop 209 in California.  Californians adopted a ban on the use of race in college admissions.  The result of the University of California was a dip in -- a substantial dip in minority enrollments at the most elite schools, a temporary dip in black enrollment at UC as a whole.  But within four or five years, the schools had launched enough outreach efforts to reverse that and to be above their pre-209 minority enrollment levels. In the meantime, students had cascaded to less elite institutions and they were completing science degrees at a much higher rate.  They were graduating at a much higher rate.  They were especially graduating in four years at a much higher rate.  They Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - had higher grades.  So the overall effects of this quasi national experiment are resoundingly positive.\", \"I think we'd like to make --\", '-- two short comments.  One is that we\\'ve generally disavowed the idea that we ought to make contributions based on race.  And it\\'s this very narrow focus on race that leads us into this bind because the logical implication of having large racial preferences for blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians is that there should be a large racial penalty for Asian-Americans. And I don\\'t think it exists everywhere but it exists in enough schools to be really repugnant.  And if we focused affirmative action more on pipeline questions, more on \"Who is having difficulty getting access?\" then there would be dramatically more focus in this whole discussion on class, which is generally ignored by universities and not on race.  And if we were focusing more on individual characteristics, we wouldn\\'t have this bind  of treating Asian-Americans the way we used to treat Jewish Americans.', \"No, I'm fine.\", \"Well, I hope, Gail and I persuaded you that we're approaching this not as an ideological matter but as one of pragmatism.  I care deeply about these issues.  I have worked on civil rights issues most of my adult life.  I have an African-American college-age son and a first grade daughter who goes to central Los Angeles schools, in a school that's -- half free lunch.  I care deeply about these issues.  And part of what informs my perspective is that when I look at higher education leaders, when I look at the folks that I know and have worked with, I see them as people who also have goodwill and are committed to racial justice and are not feeling beholden to affirmative action as something that they have to do for greater racial equality. They feel lots of other pressures.  But I'm very confident that if we reform affirmative action, they will try to find new ways to expand opportunity.  That's exactly what's happening in California under Prop 209.  There's been much closer collaboration between colleges and the K-12 pipeline since Prop 209 passed.  There's been much Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 - greater focus on class-based affirmative action.  Those things happen when you restructure the incentives.  And what I'm arguing for, I think what Gail is arguing for, is that we need to restructure the incentives that are behind the current preference system. I want to mention one other problem that's deeply embedded in our current structure, and that's the problem of social mismatch.  When you use very large racial preferences to create racial diversity, you open up a credentials chasm that's an invitation to feelings of alienation and isolation among the group that's benefited. And it's an invitation to negative stereotyping among the group that's in the majority. It's been shown that if you reduce social mismatch, if you bridge that gap some, you actually increase social interaction.  We can do a better job of figuring out where students end up in college and producing not only good outcomes for them but for their campuses.\"]\n",

Yes, I believe that Edward Snowden was fully justified in what he did. That does not cause me to support or make a judgment on any particular thing which has not yet been released or which has been released, exactly, but a question of whether he has served the public interest, on balance, in a way that could not have happened otherwise.  I don\\'t know the details that Ambassador, former DCI, James Woolsey, has told about.  And I\\'m not sure how you know, actually, unless you are privy in a way that has not been announced here.  I do know what has been released by the papers so far.  Snowden, of course, has not released a single page by himself.  He has explicitly said, over and over, that his own -- he doesn\\'t trust his own bias in terms of transparency here.  He wanted a judgment to be made of public interest by journalists that he trusted, and I think with right.  And that is what has come out so far.  I think that he was justified to the same degree, and in the same way, that I believe I was justified in releasing 4,000 or 7,000 pages of top secret documents 40 years ago, the Pentagon Papers. I believe that I had been mistaken earlier to keep silent about what I knew to be lies by my president, Lyndon Johnson, and later the president Richard Nixon, for whom I\\'d also worked, about what they were doing, what was happening, what the costs were, what the prospects were in Vietnam.  I was concerned at that moment not so much about the Constitution, which had clearly been violated in terms of lying us into that war, but I was concerned at the people who were dying on both sides wrongly, I thought, by our escalations and by those lies. I\\'m saying that Snowden, I believe, did what needed to be done, what the public needed to know.  I think there was no other way -- no better way and almost no other way -- for that information to get out; that it was worth, as he said, taking the utmost risks to his freedom and even his life. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - And, of course, we\\'ve heard exaltations, actually, by Mike Rogers of the House Intelligence Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, that he should be extralegally assassinated.  Others have suggested by due process of law -- I give Ambassador Woolsey credit for talking about the need for due process here.  But the fact is had I believed the motives that were described by the people, you know, at the beginning of the supposed opposition to Snowden, and we haven\\'t heard that precisely from these two people yet, but -- or at all -- but if I\\'d believed that he had done this for some other country, for Russia, for China, to their benefit and -- or even to major benefit to them, outweighing any benefit to the public interest -- I would not be supporting him now.  I believe firmly that Edward Snowden is no more a traitor than I am or that I was.  And I\\'m not. I was called that by the president and the vice president at the time, 40 years ago -- 43 years ago.  Many -- I was called every name that has been called, virtually, to Edward Snowden or for that matter to Chelsea Manning earlier. In terms of blood on hands, as to what would be the benefit -- the cost of this, none of that came out in my case, which is, I think, why I\\'m seen somewhat differently now, 40 years later. Nothing in Chelsea Manning\\'s trial actually came out to justify the statement that people had died as a result of his revelations, and I think you should take with more than a grain of salt the descriptions right now that much worse will happen from Edward Snowden, revelations. The fact is that, I think, what he revealed was not just what NSA was doing, which I will make a premise -- I will stipulate -- was essentially with the knowledge of the president, at the orders of the president, desire of the president, and the knowledge of key figures in Congress. But, as Ben Wizner made the point, that to me reveals his greatest revelation, which is that the reforms that came in after earlier revelations of abuses by the FBI, CIA, NSA, and Army Intelligence, 40 years ago and 35 years ago, that led to the Church Committee and the current reforms, like the FISA Court and the intelligence committees, I think what Snowden has revealed is that those reforms, which were very necessary, failed. And they need to be not only redone, but better reforms are necessary, and I hope very much will result from what Snowden has revealed.  As a matter of fact, I\\'ll have mentioned already that Ambassador Woolsey has said that he thought there should be due process, there should be a trial for treason -- that\\'s something I\\'d argue with -- which implies that he thinks that Snowden adhered to an enemy of the United States -- that\\'s the definition in the Constitution, which I know he knows. I certainly disagree with him on that, and I think there\\'s -- that\\'s absolutely wrong. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - But he believes then as a result he should get the maximum penalty for that, which is to be hanged by the neck till he is dead.  Now, actually one American was hanged by the neck for giving secrets to Americans.  Actually, he was the first American to be charged with giving secrets to Americans.  I was the second, 200 years later.  His name was Nathan Hale, and it was a name that used to be known to every American school child as I know, and I\\'ve found sadly that, that\\'s not -- seems not to be the case today.  And he was an American spy for George Washington during the American Revolution, hanged by the British, and the reason he was remembered during my growing up was for his words on the gallows: \"I regret that I have but one life to give for my country.\"  What country was that? Not the country of his birth, that was the colony of King George III, in which he was in rebellion, and was charged with treason essentially, of which he was essentially guilty to George III, like every other signer of the Declaration of Independence, five of whom, out of 56, were hanged as a result.  But they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, like Nathan Hale, to a country that did not yet exist in the world, a country of -- later to be, shortly to be -- of a constitution with separation of powers, independent branches with checks and balances against each other, and a country with a Bill of Rights.  When Snowden said there were things worth dying for, I agree with him. That\\'s the mood in which I gave the Pentagon Papers, and I think he was right to do what he did to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States.', 'Let me move on something else --', 'Okay.', \"Okay, most of the material that I put out in the Pentagon Papers, 4,000 pages that I gave to the newspapers, an additional 3,000 that I gave only to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it so happens, so there's some I didn't put out, it's very clear, by the way, that Snowden had an enormous amount of information that he could have put out.  He says, and hasn't been challenged, that he chose not to because he thought it was not in the public interest. And a lot of what he put out was for background to the press in looking at that, but he relied on their judgment as to what to put out.  In terms of when you say there was a difference in my case, in the 4,000 or even the 7,000 pages, there was actually no evidence of clear cut domestic criminality or even international criminality.  So if it was whistleblowing, and I would say it was, that's not a requirement.  I thought it was reckless, deceptive, dangerous decision making, and I felt it was still going on.  And, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - unfortunately, I did not have the documents to prove what I was saying at the time from oral testimony I got --\", \"Okay, right, let me address that.  They revealed, of course, and it's the only way we know, that Clapper, director of National Intelligence, Clapper, gave a false statement to - - we know it from Snowden. Now, I do not believe, as Ben Wizner says, that actually he meant to deceive Congress.  I don't believe he did deceive Congress.  I believe that he, unchallenged by Congress, meant to deceive the public and did so effectively since Congress didn't challenge it.  I just read a very interesting piece of background here by Mr. McCarthy which convinced me that Sensenbrenner is speaking very questionably when he denies that he knew or that his act covered that.  That's the problem.  Let me assume that Sensenbrenner is not telling the truth on this.\", 'I -- James Sensenbrenner who calls himself the \"architect of the Patriot Act,\" although, again, Mr. McCarthy said that was quite misleading.  The point here is that Congress has been willing to deceive the public along with the NSA and the president regularly here, and that\\'s the problem, that Snowden revealed. And I want to make a specific point here that was raised earlier on this metadata.  Why are we talking only about metadata entirely here?  First of all, there\\'s a lot of text messages that are not metadata, 200 million a day, that get brought up.  But what makes us believe that we were not listening on a different program -- I don\\'t mean listening, I mean collecting recording for later retrieval -- all the content of the emails and all the content of the audio of the telephone?  And the answer is the president and the others keep saying, \"We don\\'t do it.\"  Why should we believe them?  Why would you believe [inaudible]?', \"But how did we hear that?  We heard it from Snowden's documents that came out.\", 'We saw opinions of the FISA Court, the Federal Court  had not been made public.', 'Right.', '[inaudible] can actually say how many times, out of 13,000 requests for warrants, 11 had to be modified or refused.', 'Oh, [inaudible].', 'Yeah, warrants that get turned down, turned down.', '[affirmative]', 'But did they --', 'Did they succeed?', 'They are not [unintelligible] --', \"-- a check in the balance? It didn't happen.\", 'Clapper --', 'Clapper made a full statement.', \"Okay. Fine. I'm glad to have a chance to address that. Actually, the president and others -- many others -- have spoken about -- there was a better way, the way it was done was sensational, more heat than light. There were better ways to do that. I think that's clearly wrong. I really whether the president is so misinformed about the situation as actually to believe that. There were four NSA high officials -- senior officials -- I'll name them: Kurt Wiebe, Ed Loomis, Bill Binney, and Thomas Drake, who have among them an average of 30 years in the NSA -- one is 28, another is 32 -- who left the NSA because it conflicted with their conscience eventually. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - They left it because it conflicted with the Constitution. They had tested the proposition - - that is, there are other ways to do it -- in every possible way. They had complained to their superiors that the then warrantless surveillance that was going on since 9/11 was unconstitutional, was a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\", 'The Fourth Amendment.', \"Let me say -- let me say on that.  Let me go a little further.  It wasn't just unconstitutional.  The warrant with surveillance I think was blatantly illegal and criminal actually --\", \"Well, I'm sorry, I do need to say --\", 'Yeah, okay.', 'They did everything -- they went to their superiors, they went to the inspector generals and NSA and at the DIB.  They went to congressional staff and asked to testify.  They asked to testify in open court under oath. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 - They got nowhere.  Every one of them was subject wrongly to an FBI raid which took their computers without charging them ever with anything.  Thomas Drake as a result, has got a spurious investigation and so forth.  They have each said, in contrast -- without endorsing everything that Snowden has said -- they have said the path he used was the only way to do what they had tried to do, was to bring this to the attention of Congress and the public and that there was no other way to do it.', 'We were talking in 2001 to 2006 about metadata.  They were collecting -- Thomas Drake --', \"Thomas Drake was saying at the time, within NSA, and has said since, they were collecting content.  And he said it's a secret --\", \"We're not talking metadata.\", 'I can see why [unintelligible].', \"I can believe that Ambassador Woolsey is totally sincere in his description of that.  Of course, he's not speaking as a whistleblower, and I wonder how many whistleblowers experience -- actual whistleblowers he has actually spoken to.  I have, a great many; the government accountability project and many others. The experience of going to IGs is simply a way of being -- and to your superiors is a way of identifying yourself as a troublemaker who will be suspected of being a leaker if there is a leak.  That's why the four NSA people who had not been a leak to the New York Times -- which in my opinion, they should have been and certainly would have been more effective, that's why they were raided by the FBI and the computers, because they identified themselves as somebody who already thought the system was Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - unconstitutional.  Ambassador Woolsey, I thought by your own comment, if I understood you correctly -- and I'm interested that you work on Senate armed services committee and were a senior staffer on that.  But I thought I heard you say there were four staffers.  There were -- which sounds about right.  And there were some others. And the idea, of course, that we're talking about effective oversight is absolutely ludicrous.  Judges of the FISA court, several of them now, especially ones off and even some who are on, have said, what can we do to see whether any of our orders are implemented?  We don't have technical experience.  We don't have staff, we don't have budget.  And essentially the same is true of these committees. And I want to make one last point here.  Russell Tice -- well, first Thomas Drake has said -- the one I'm talking about -- has said the secret they're trying to hold onto desperately is to talk about metadata and not reveal how much content they are already recording. And Russell Tice has said, I, in the NSA, had phone records of Justice Alito, of journalists' sources, of Congress people, including Feinstein and her staff and a great deal of content.  Now, maybe he's wrong -- maybe he's wrong, but he has asked to testify under oath to Congress.  And not one committee has asked one of them to testify because they don't want to know.\", 'And you should have.', \"Up to four.  That's pretty good.\", \"I'm sorry.  The statement that NSA has lost those programs is as reliable as the statement by NSA that he's released 1.7 million documents.  Snowden has said publicly and to me it so happens on encrypted line that, that's an absurd estimate and has no relation to the much, much, much lower amount that he released in terms of this.  And the reason that does make a difference is that obviously 1.7 or one million or five -- half a million --\", \"-- can't be read by him.  He learned from Manning to avoid the charge that he was releasing anything he had not read himself.\", \"No, no, no, it's not absurd.  Maybe it happened.  But to take at face value the statement that NSA has not been able to replace that, that it doesn't have substitutes, that it got -- that it actually caused them harm [inaudible] --\", 'Fine, that\\'s also part -- that\\'s part of it. [talking simultaneously] Male Speaker: [inaudible] the programs of other foreign intelligence services. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - Daniel Ellsberg: What I\\'m saying is that this sort of thing can\\'t be decided by you or me or by the press, it has to be decided by intelligence committees in a court that have an entirely different technical capability and backup and access -- technical access to NSA programs that does not exist now.  And I\\'ve been trying to give one specific example of that, when Russell Tice has said numerous times and in public that he had evidence, personal knowledge, of targeting of every member of the Armed Service Committee, every member of the Intelligence Committee, including Feinstein, her staff, and home, prepared to testify that under oath -- when he said that he wanted to testify, NSA immediately sent him a letter, which I\\'ve seen, saying, \"You are --\" this is to the Armed Services Committee, your old committee -- and he said, \"I want to testify to Armed Services.\"  And they said, \"We remind you of your oath under NSA, the Armed Services Committee --\" and they didn\\'t distinguish between staff and members -- \"the Armed Services Committee is not cleared for that information.\" What?  This is --', '-- this is oversight?  This is an absolutely broken system.', \"Isn't this off the record? [laughter]\", 'Well, the answer I\\'ve heard -- and it\\'s a question of who you believe on this -- is that Snowden said that he had actually the knowledge of practically every clandestine office of NSA in the world, not only the knowledge, but he -- I mean, he hadn\\'t just seen it, but he had the knowledge. He said he had no intention of releasing that or taking it with him to China or anywhere else that he took the classified information, because that would not be in the public interest. Now, should we believe him? Well, some say, \"No, it\\'s all Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 - given to China.\" First of all, I trust his judgment as to what the public ought to know or not know about NSA more than I trust the judgment of anybody who said, \"None of this should be known to the public.\" I don\\'t think their judgment is to be trusted at all. And I do trust -- subject to  analysis. It\\'s the Congress and the courts, and it\\'s the four people in NSA -- plus Tice -- have all said it is essential that there be a group of technies, nerds, hacker types who have the technical knowledge, reporting with full access to NSA data, reporting to Congress and to the judiciary, and that\\'s the only way we will get this system under constitutional control.', \"I'm sorry, the point here has been -- again, I'm surprised didn't make -- it's not just that he gave it to journalists for their judgment, I think passed over very quickly here.  The Guardian and The Washington Post have both said that they have checked every article that they put out with NSA. Some would disagree with their doing that, but they have done it, precisely to avoid danger of the sources and methods that you're describing of causing definite harm. Now, in -- that is a first point which hasn't been made here exactly.  But the fact is that Wyden and Udall -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -\", 'Congressman Wyden -- senator.', \"Senator Wyden and Senator Udall in fact felt that it was outrageous, that it was shocking to the American people if they knew that, if they knew this stuff, and it was probably unconstitutional.  This is part of the intelligence committee.  They knew that Clapper was lying when he said that.  They could not put it out, supposedly, because the rule of the committee was to keep that secret.  I would say they made a very poor judgment there.  I'm critical of them.  Obviously I'm on their side on many aspects of this.  But I think they were not justified in choosing to stay in the committee, the price of which was to keep that secret from the American public that they thought should be public in order to keep that -- to cooperate in keeping that secret. The fact is that keeping your mouth shut -- and we are talking here about communications intelligence matters here, which were covered by 798.  I had clearance for that at the time.  I did not put out anything.  I --\", \"Thank you, I -- [applause] -- I agree with Ambassador Woolsey that, that was, as director of Central Intelligence, an appropriate way to behave, [unintelligible] convincing, and that the news editor was right, convinced by your argument, to change it. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - The Guardian and the Washington Post have both said that they have modified at the request of the NSA virtually every story that they have written on the basis of this.  They did not accept all the objections, but that in every case they have done some.  I think that's appropriate.  On one question that's come up again and again here as to what might happen with this American NSA government, Congressional collection of potentially everything -- everything including content. Let's call it potential at this moment. In fact, I would ask Mr. McCarthy what he believes the collection storage agency for NSA data being built in Bluffdale Utah right now is for, if it is not for audio and video content. As Tice has said, it is in use right now -- and part of it. And all the digital data in the world -- that's e-mail, chat logs, credit logs, everything -- can be stored in a small room. This huge facility is being collected, he believes, for content. And I wonder if you believe otherwise. When it comes to 9/11, if anyone here in the audience -- or at this table -- believes that Edward Snowden -- or any of us -- wants to increase the risk of another 9/11 or is indifferent to that, I think they are being very foolish. When it comes to having gone to Congress, I think he learned from the example -- specifically of the NSA four people that I've talked about, plus Tice -- that that would be a foolish thing to do. I must say that if you had asked me a year ago, when I believed these people as to what was being collected, whether there was any chance of reining this in and preserving our democracy, the separation of powers and everything -- with what was being collected, I would have been very pessimistic --\", '-- Edward Snowden has made --', \"Edward Snowden has given me hope. And the reaction to what he's done and the reaction of Congress and the public has given me hope. And I would say, when it comes --\", '-- [inaudible] take a very solemn oath to defend our borders --']\n",
      "[\"He does know.  He has been following the global debate very closely, and he's aware of this debate tonight.\", \"Well, you know, there's a nine-hour time difference, but he's a night owl, so I would put the chances at about 50/50.\", 'I am joined tonight by a genuine American hero.  Pentagon Papers whistleblower, Daniel Ellsberg. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 -', 'Thank you very much.  It\\'s a great honor to be able to share a table with a man I\\'ve admired all my life, in support of a man who I\\'ve come to admire tremendously over the last eight months.  On June 7th of last year, following the publication of the first NSA stories in the Washington Post and the Guardian, but before Edward Snowden had revealed his identity to us, President Obama addressed the revelations.  And he said, \"I welcome this debate, and I think it is healthy for our democracy.\" The president was right.  This debate has been healthy for our democracy and for democracies around the world.  In fact, it\\'s the extraordinary global debate that Edward Snowden launched -- a debate about the threat that mass surveillance poses to free societies, about how surveillance technologies have outpaced democratic controls, about whether the Internet will be an instrument of democratic liberation or authoritarian control -- that provides the best answer to tonight\\'s debate.  Edward Snowden is justified because he provided to journalists and through them to us information that we had a right to know and that we had a need to know.  The government had not just concealed this information, it had lied to us about it.  And the debate that we\\'ve had and that we\\'re still having would not have happened any other way.  Now, in those same June 7th remarks, President Obama also defended the government\\'s surveillance practices.  He said that those practices had been blessed and approved by all three branches of government:  within the executive branch, by the courts, and by the Congress. Now, in making that point, President Obama probably would have said that he was joining our opponents\\' table.  I would respectfully submit that exactly the opposite is true.  And why do I say that?  I say it because the same oversight bodies that had blessed these activities in the dark have dramatically challenged them and changed course in the light. Now, all three branches of government are engaged in a historic Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - reevaluation of the NSA\\'s surveillance practices. And we\\'re virtually certain to see the first new limits on intelligence surveillance since the 1970s. What a difference an informed public can make. In short, our traditional democratic oversight mechanisms failed miserably before Snowden\\'s revelations. Now, they\\'re doing their jobs. Let\\'s begin with Congress. When the Guardian revealed that the NSA had been -- collected the phone records of every American on a daily basis, many members of Congress expressed shock -- even though that program was purportedly authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Now, there\\'s been a lot of debate since then about whether Congress did or did not know, or what they knew or did not know. But does it really matter? Either way, this was a colossal failure of oversight. Either they knew and did nothing, or they didn\\'t know what the NSA was doing in collecting all the Americans\\' information on a daily basis. Now, we\\'re all familiar with Congress\\'s most dramatic oversight failure. And this was in the notorious exchange between Senator Ron Wyden and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Wyden had asked, did the NSA collect any type of data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? Clapper\\'s answer was, \"No, sir.\" Now, this brazen falsehood is most often described as Clapper\\'s lie to Congress, but that\\'s not what it was. Wyden knew that Clapper was lying. Only we didn\\'t know. And Congress lacked the courage to correct the record -- allowed us to be deceived by the Director of National Intelligence. To me, that is the very definition of failed oversight. And Edward Snowden was watching. Now, what about our courts? The court that had blessed the NSA\\'s mass surveillance of Americans is a specialized court that meets in secret and hears only from the government. It was designed to grant warrants for foreign intelligence collection. It makes sense that such a court would hear only from the government. Over the last decade, it expanded its role to rule on the legality and constitutionality of programmatic surveillance. Judicial review of those programs amounted to a secret court upholding secret programs by secretly reinterpreting American -- federal laws. Now, when groups like the ACLU tried to challenge the NSA\\'s activities in open federal courts, an interesting thing happened. The government didn\\'t say to those courts that the programs were illegal. The government said that we had no right to be in court. And the courts exceeded to that demand. The government\\'s argument was, we couldn\\'t prove that we had been surveilled. Therefore, we had no standing to even raise these challenges. And in a 5 to 4 decision last year, the Supreme Court accepted that rationale and dismissed the case without Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - even considering the legality of these programs. Edward Snowden was watching that too. Now, when critics say that Edward Snowden should have gone through the system, that\\'s the system they\\'re talking about. Courts and a Congress that had abdicated their constitutional oversight role. Now, what\\'s happened since Edward Snowden\\'s act of conscience -- since he brought the public into this discussion? Well, two federal judges have now considered whether the NSA\\'s mass collection of Americans\\' phone data is legal. One said it\\'s almost certainly unconstitutional, almost Orwellian. Another disagreed, but the key point is that both of these judges heard the challenge. They both agreed that we had standing to challenge the program, which was a remarkable development in itself. Finally, these courts are doing their job and more challenges are on the way. What about Congress? A newly energized Congress has held dozens of oversight hearings -- public ones -- And is considering sweeping intelligence reforms that we haven\\'t seen in nearly half a century -- to end bulk collection of Americans\\' phone records, to reform that secret FISA court so that it doesn\\'t only hear from the government and others. Even the executive branch has undergone an extraordinary reevaluation of these programs. An NSA review panel appointed by the president -- which included very, very senior former intelligence officials -- the number two at the CIA -- concluded that the NSA had allowed its technological capabilities to dictate its surveillance practices, rather than ensuring that its practices conform to our laws and values. None of this would have happened without Edward Snowden. For that reason alone, he was justified.', \"Well, I've been following this issue very closely, to say the least, over the last ten years or more.  I did not know until The Guardian published the document that the NSA, which is a foreign intelligence agency, was, on a daily basis, collecting the phone records of almost every American.  Someone else who didn't know, or says he didn't know is Republican representative Jim Sensenbrenner who was one of the principal authors of the Patriot Act, who says that he didn't know until this document was published that section 215 of the Patriot Act was being used in this way. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - Whether, again, that's true or not isn't important to my argument.  Either he did not know -- he certainly should have known.  Either way, Congress didn't do anything about it.  As soon as the public was read into this debate, we're now seeing open federal courts debate the constitutionality of this.  One federal judge actually enjoined it and said it's almost certainly unconstitutional.  And we're seeing Congress threaten not to reauthorize this unless the administration will agree to reforms.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 - I might have lost it in the give and take a little bit, but I will say this, that one of the points that I made was precisely that the court that had approved this 15 times had exceeded its mandate. This is a court that quite properly was set up to hear warrant applications in secret. When you're seeking a warrant, you don't need an adversarial process. We don't want the person who we're conducting surveillance on to know that we've sought a warrant. What this court started to do over the last decade was to write long opinions -- 30, 50, 80 pages long -- ruling on whether whole programs of surveillance were consistent with federal statutes and consistent with the Constitution. They did that without the benefit of any adversary. They did that without anybody arguing the other side in front of these courts. Many of these judges who have left the court have said they would have benefited from an adversary. And what's happened now that these same challenges are being brought in open federal courts? Well, now there's a 50-50 response so far. One judge in New York said that he thought that the phone records program was legal. One judge in D.C., a Republican judge, appointed by a Republican president, said he thought the program was almost Orwellian and a threat to democracy.\", 'Yeah, he did.  He certainly has told Barton Gellman of the Washington Post that he did complain regularly internally.  But it\\'s interesting that you think he should have gone to the same Congress that you say knew everything that he was going to report.  Congress did know.  He was supposed to tell -- Senator Wydenwas on the floor of the Senate with his hair on fire saying, \"If only the public knew what I knew, they would be outraged, they would be furious.\"  Well, we didn\\'t know because he didn\\'t tell us.  We only know it because Edward Snowden gave it to the press, and the press told us.  Now the rules are changing.', 'Well, and how effective could it have been?', 'No, no.', \"No, I'm saying he did report his concerns to superiors.\", 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 - One time when he reported concerns to superiors in a posting in Geneva, he was reprimanded and punished for it.  This is the experience of people who complained in the intelligence community is that they either get ignored or they get crushed.', \"Well, that gives us another opportunity to clarify and to respond to one of Andy McCarthy's points.\", \"Yes.  The number of documents that Snowden has disclosed is zero.  Snowden provided a great deal of material to journalists.  He entrusted it to journalists, at The Guardian, at The Washington Post.  It's since expanded to the New York Times and other newspapers.  His instructions to those reporters were that they, in consultation with their own editors, using their own judgment of what was in the public interest, and in Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - consultation with the United States government, should publish what the public ought to know and should withhold what the public should not know. My view is that the reporting until now has been extremely responsible.  There has not been an article published that didn't give at least the government a chance to weigh in. There have been redactions --\", 'I mean, this is [inaudible]--', \"No.  What I'm saying is there is a difference and a long tradition of having journalists compete with the security state over what should be secret and what should be public. If you look at the last decade, what we would not have known without leaks and investigative journalists, we wouldn't have known about torture at Abu Ghraib, we wouldn't have known that the CIA had set up a network of secret prisons across Europe and the Middle East, we wouldn't have known that the NSA had engaged in warrantless wiretapping before this was legalized by Congress in 2008. All of this we know because journalists engage in competition with government for what the public ought to know and what it shouldn't know.  Now, what Snowden did was on a larger scale.  He gave a large amount of information to journalists, and those journalists include journalists around the world.  I think part of what he wanted us to understand is that this is not about demonizing the NSA.  The threat of mass dragnet surveillance, of collecting information about all of us in case one of us comes under suspicion, is a threat to all free society.\", \"We don't know the answer yet.  We don't know what has still to be published.  And it's possible that the most important revelation that Snowden provided to journalists has not yet been published.  Do I think that the reporting so far has been in the public interest?  I think so, profoundly.\", 'No, no --', '-- according to national security officials, not according to the press.  The press, quoting unnamed national security officials, quoting classified reports, that information is as false as their testimony was to Congress -- [talking simultaneously]', 'Can I respond to this briefly?', 'Yeah, because I think that we may be slightly on the wrong track here. Sometimes the scandal is something that is illegal that\\'s going on, that people don\\'t know about, that Congress doesn\\'t know about. And what the proper channel is, to go to Congress and alert them -- sometimes the scandal is that a whole regime has been created in secret Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 - that the system deems legal. And that\\'s what we\\'re talking about here. I believe that these programs were briefed to the committees. I believe that the intelligence committees routinely approved this and were briefed on this, that they were taken to General Alexander\\'s lair, where he had Hollywood set designers design a captain\\'s chair and had the doors whoosh open and close like on the deck of the Starship Enterprise -- this was in an article in Foreign Policy Magazine. I believe that they knew what was going on. So, a 29-year-old contractor calls up Congress and says, \"Excuse me, I need to really tell you what you have wrongly approved in secret\" -- no. What was needed -- [laughter] -- was for the public to know. And once the public knew, everything changed. [applause]', \"Well, you know, again, I treat with great skepticism the claims that we're less safe.  The Nixon administration, in trying to block the publication of the Pentagon Papers in the New York Times told the Supreme Court that their publication would cause great and irreparable harm to the security of the United States.  Now, that was nonsense.  And the lawyer who wrote that brief said so 15 years ago in an apologetic op ed in The Washington Post.  I think he's claims of harm to national security don't age as well as whistleblowers who age very, very well. [laughter] But look, we're not just talking about protecting ourself from a threat of terrorism, which, although severe, is not a common occurrence.  We're talking about protecting our republic.  And sometimes our republic is more threatened by what we don't know than by publication of things that also alert our enemies.  That detention that we face in a democracy, but the cost of democracy is that our enemies have to hear this too.  We have to strike the balance in the right way. My view is that the balance was way tilted towards overclassification and secrecy before Edward Snowden.\", \"Well, actually, I think with a long term effective, Snowden's revelations will make us safer in a critical respect.  They will have an effect on the infrastructure of our communications, that -- one of the effects is that we will begin to prioritize defense, securing our communications over offense, manufacturing vulnerabilities in order to facilitate surveillance, this is a tension that exists within the NSA right now.  I think that the spies have won out over the cyber defenders.  And I think that it's in all our best -- all of our best interests to put more of our resources into defending the security of our communications rather than being sure that we can listen to every conversation in the world.\", \"Yes, I think so.  I think -- look, it's interesting that we have a strict liability standard for disclosing information, but we have a classification system that massively, massively overclassifies.  Both can be dangerous.  Look, I think that what Edward Snowden is go about it in a way that he considered responsible.  He said, I've spent a sheltered life.  I've been in the intelligence community.  I don't trust my own biases.  I'm going to go to principled but aggressive journalists.  And those journalists should use their judgment about what should be published. Now, Edward Snowden told Time magazine -- he didn't agree with all those judgments -- that there were articles that were published that he did not agree were in the public interest, but that proved his point that he is not the one who should have been making those decisions alone and on his own.  But, look, I think it's relevant to the question.  If you could show me, with evidence and not classified innuendo, that what Edward Snowden did was more damaging to our national security than healthy for our democracy, I would take a different position.  Nothing I've heard pushes me there.\", \"I'm saying he's not in control of what's being published.\", \"Well, that's actually what most leakers do.\", 'Okay. [laughter]', 'I want to close with a few observations about the surveillance apparatus that Edward Snowden, through journalists has exposed.  For much of our history, our privacy was protected as much by cost as by law.  It was simply too expensive for governments to track most of us most of the time. Now because of technology, for the first time in our history, it\\'s technologically and feasibly possible, financially possible for governments to track all of us on a massive scale and to collect and store the majority of the world\\'s communications.  We now know that the NSA has built that capability and has used it in ways that are profoundly troubling to many of us.  Polls show that 6 in 10 Americans think that the NSA\\'s surveillance practices have gone too far.  But Edward Snowden was even more concerned about what the NSA might do with these capabilities, say, in the aftermath of a traumatic terrorist attack.  He believed that the weak protections that are in place right now were likely to be swept away and that our country\\'s system would be replaced by one that looked very, very different.  Now, whether and with what controls we should entrust our government with those kinds of enormous powers is a hugely consequential decision in a democracy. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 - We should have debated this issue before the NSA deployed a global dragnet surveillance apparatus.  We didn\\'t but it\\'s not too late to debate it now and to impose strong democratic controls.  Now, I began this debate by quoting President Obama, and I\\'m going to end in the same way.  Just a few weeks ago he gave a speech in January about NSA surveillance and the reforms that he would be implementing and proposing. And President Obama repeated his words from June.  He said, \"One thing I am certain of, this debate will make us stronger.\"  The president of the United States believes that the debate Edward Snowden launched, a debate that no one can seriously argue would have taken place without him, has made our nation stronger.', \"I can't think of any stronger justification than that.\"]\n",

Theyre imbedded in the structure of the law and theyll become more acute as this scheme unfolds.  Obamacare rests on some deeply flawed concepts that turn the proposals against the legislations own laudible goals.  Simply put, its a plan at war with its own ambitions.  And tonight I want to briefly address some of the paradoxes embedded in this law. First, Obamacare seeks to lower the cost of health care, but instead it creates new arrangements that will only make medical care more expensive.  A big reason is provisions that deliberately force doctors to consolidate their medical practices around hospitals.  Having doctors work for hospitals is often the costliest way to deliver care, and we know there's a lot of excess capacity in hospitals.  We've basically built in a subsidy of that excess capacity.  And we also know that there's ample evidence that when physicians become the employees of hospitals and hospital-owned systems, productivity falls.  And when hospitals buy up local physicians in a community, enabling them to exercise monopoly pricing power, they raise prices.  Second, the law seeks to Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - increase competition between insurers its partly seen as a way to lower costs, but Obamacare will actually reduce the number of health plans in the marketplace and leave you with fewer choices.  For one thing, Obamacare taps the operating margins of health plans.  This basically protects the businesses of incumbent insurers at the expense of new start-ups and new entrants. Obamacare also uses regulation to prescribe a single uniform benefit package.  The result is that consumers are left with just one option when it comes to the benefits they can choose from.  Go on the website and take a look for yourself and I'm putting out some data on this next week.  If you look at the health plans that insurance companies sell on the exchanges, the provider networks and the drug formularies are exactly the same.  It doesn't matter if you buy a plan that's a bronze plan, a gold plan, or a platinum plan.  By buying up to a costlier plan, all you're doing is lowering your co-pays and deductibles.  In other words, you're just fronting a higher premium to buy down your out-of-pocket costs.  There is no competition between these plans based on benefits or networks.  There is no real choice in these exchanges.  Third, Obamacare is aimed at reducing the number of uninsured Americans, but the vast majority of the uninsured who get coverage under this scheme will end up on Medicaid. And so what about the people who sign up for private coverage in the Obamacare exchanges?  They're going to mostly be people who were previously insured in the individual or small-group markets and got moved into Obamacare, some of them forcibly.  But don't take my word for this.  Look at the numbers being put out by the administration.  The White House says that 19 million people will be added to Medicaid. That's a 35 percent increase in the size of the program, but at best, five million people will get Obamacare coverage this year and it's probably going to be closer to four million.  But we know at least five million people lost their policies when the mandates of this law were imposed on a private market and insurers had to drop old plans to conform.  And as for the uninsured, the lower middle class folks, for people above 200 percent of the federal poverty level, family of four earning about $50,000 a year -- Obamacare is still too expensive for them, even with the benefits and the subsidies. And so, a family of four earning $50,000 a year will have to pay $400 a month, even after the subsidies, to buy that coverage.  That's $5,000 a month.  And they're getting a plan with a $3,000 deductible.  The problem is that's not a good plan for that family. And the problem is that these plans were designed in Washington to meet political aspirations rather than marketplace, to meet the demand of what consumers needed. And think about this.  There were 46.3 million uninsured in 2008, when President Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - Obama took office.  This year, there were 48 million uninsured Americans.  The only way the president is going to leave office with fewer uninsured Americans than when his term began is by obligating more people to Medicaid.  Obamacare is really a Medicaid law.  And so, it begs the question, what about Medicaid?  There is now ample evidence in the clinical literature that people on Medicaid are experiencing worse health outcomes than people in other  insurance schemes.  And sometimes even in the uninsured.  Simply put, reimbursement rates have been driven so low in the Medicaid program that folks can't get access to the benefits that they're promised on paper. I don't consider it successful if the only way we reduce the roles of the uninsured in this country is by obligating more Americans to a Medicaid program that is quite literally worsening medical outcomes.  This doesn't seem moral.  Yet Obamacare does almost nothing to fix that Medicaid.  It just pushes more people to an already failing system. In many ways, these problems that plague Medicaid will also plague Obamacare. Obamacare makes so many costly promises on paper, but the only way to pay for these commitments is to reduce what providers are paid.  And Obamacare, this is now a network that contains a very short list of providers and closed drug formularies that leave key medicines uncovered.  And the Obamacare regulations don't just apply to the Obamacare plans.  This is a federalization of all insurance in this country, so everyone's benefits need to conform to the single, uniform national standard.  Obamacare was a response to a flawed healthcare system.  There's no question about that.  But it makes things worse.  It reduces choice and competition in health plans. It increases costs by reducing the productivity of the practice of medicine.  And finally, it only reduces the number of uninsured by obligating millions of more people to a Medicaid benefit that's quite literally harming people's health.  In all of these ways, Obamacare works again its own laudable intentions.  There are far better ways to address issues of the uninsured in this country and far better ways to address the issues of those who are priced out of the insurance market.  For all these reasons and more, Obamacare is now beyond rescue.  Thanks a lot. [applause]\", \"Well, look, I -- look, in a wealthy country, I think we need to address issues of people who are priced out of the market, people who have preexisting conditions and can't find coverage.  I think there were far more efficient ways to do that.  You could've given people incentives to get insured and stay insured, and it would have required that you subsidize certain people to get into the marketplace and subsidize them through transitions in life where they   might otherwise not have the income and lose coverage. There's nothing inherently wrong with pooling people based on what state they live in, for example, if that's the point, if this is copying Mitt Romney's plan. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - What's inherently wrong with this law is the way that the law tries to prescribe a uniform federal standard for what needs to be in everyone's insurance policy.  And so these decisions get made in a political context, and you end up with policies that are exceedingly expensive, laden down with mandates that don't meet what consumers want.  And then  you tell insurers they can't underwrite risk, they can't use cost  sharing as a tool to steer people to certain benefits or others, they can't change the benefit design, and so they're forced to do one thing which is to narrow the networks of providers that people have access to and to skinny down the drug formularies, which is exactly what we've done in Medicaid.\", \"Its the structure that's inherently flawed.\", \"I think that the problem is that the people in Washington -- progressives in Washington can't resist the temptation to tinker with every aspect of what the provisions are, and you end up with regulations that prescribe exactly what people have to have and don't have to have.  Surgical sterilization is in.  Certain things are out.  You have a law that gets laden down with mandates and it ends up being -- exceeding expensive to  provide this coverage to everyone, they have to do it, the insurers have to go after the network, exactly what we've done in Medicaid.  We've promised a very rich set of benefits on paper in Medicaid.  It looks like a fabulous program, but we know Medicaid recipients can't get access to the care.  I don't think it's being done politically because it -- these decisions now are being made in Washington.\", 'I was [unintelligible].', \"And they've announced --\", 'We know this pool is exceedingly unhealthy by virtue of --', \"What does it tell you that no -- people don't want this coverage.  The administration on the conference call which I was on the other day, and announcing this data, bragged about the fact that 44.5 million people went to the website and started to look at health plans, we know only 1.2 million signed up, that conversion rate is worse than banner ads.  It's worse than sex ads on Twitter. I mean, that is a bad conversion rate.  That tells you people are looking at these plans and not buying them because they're not good plans for consumers because they weren't designed to be.\", \"Let me tell you what a death spiral looks like.  Every year -- this is a provision that a lot of people haven't noticed yet.  Every year that these subsidies make these sort of value of the health plans sold in this law get re-priced.  In Medicare Part D they also get re- priced.  The subsidies get re-priced.  They get re-priced each year from a blended average of all the plans in the marketplace.  They had a convergence of sort of a mean Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 - value of the plans.  In this marketplace they get re-priced off the second cheapest plan in every market.  The second cheapest plan in Florida is a plan that has seven pediatricians for a county with 250,000 kids.  Next year all the policies in Florida will now be re-priced off that plan.  So all the plans will have to conform to that benefit structure. That is a death spiral. [applause] \", \"It's a death spiral in the quality of the coverage.  You end up with a plan that looks like Medicaid.  Now again, I haven't heard anyone defend Medicaid.\", \"I'm not happy with giving people false promise.

It will be the same quality, the same narrow networks, because --\", \"Well, it's already happening.  I mean, if you look at the quality of these plans, if you look at the networks, and I'm putting out data on this next week, I hope everyone goes to the website and sees it.  If you look at the networks in Obamacare they are Medicaid networks.  If you look at the plans that are preparing bids for next year, it's Medicaid plans that didnt get into the market this year.  This will evolve into a Medicaid benefit. We didn't need to obligate people to a Medicaid benefit and we have done nothing to fix the existing Medicaid benefit.  The changes you talk about was a temporary increase, a small increase in payments to primary care providers, that now sunsetted at the very point that we're going to push 19 more million people into Medicaid. Can you imagine trying to service 19 more million people with the existing Medicaid program?  What is that going to look like?\", 'Jonathan --', 'The studies controlled that.', \"Yeah.  I think the discussion about Medicaid is operative here, because this is -- this is a real dilemma that I can't get to the bottom of.  People feel good about Medicaid in Washington.  I worked in Washington.  People look at the benefits that are being promised on paper in Medicaid and think that it is a fabulous program.  The practical Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - reality is that anyone who works in the medical marketplace knows that's just not the case.  We have done the same thing with Obamacare.  We have promised something that looks very good on paper.  The practical reality that's already taking shape in the marketplace is people are not going to be able to get what they're being promised on paper. And so, the question becomes, why do we feel good about what we do in Washington on paper when the reality doesn't approximate what we've said we've done --\", \"But it's not an outcome I don't like.  It's --\", 'But --', \"It's not what we set out to do.  We set out to achieve something and we're not even -- we're not even pretending that we're going to achieve it.

They\\'re subsidized up to 400 percent.  The subsidies fall off at 250 percent quite rapidly.  That\\'s about 20 million people.  My question is, \"Why did we --\" if we wanted to target 20 million people, which is what this law inevitably is going to end up doing, why did we have to disrupt the insurance scheme for 350 million Americans?  I mean, everyone was affected by this. [applause] Male Speaker: Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 - And there\\'s simply no evidence of any of that disruption.', 'How many people -- how many people got notice from insurance plans, that their plans were changed or canceled this year?

They're just a claw  back on your tax return if you're owed a refund.  A clever accountant can easily structure your tax returns so that you would never have to pay a penalty.  I think everyone recognizes the individual mandate,  so- called tax penalty really isn't an operating feature in this anymore, and will probably be suspended this year, but they will wait till after March 31 to do it.\", \"That's all right.\", \"Well, I'll let Megan speak for herself.  I was quite clear, and I've been quite clear when I've talked about this a lot.  I think the goals here were laudable. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 - I think we have to do something to try to help people who are priced out of the insurance market or people who found themselves in between plans that didn't have -- weren't in insurance pools where they had portability.  We could've addressed those issues in a far more [unintelligible] disrupting with so many dislocations  in the marketplace.  I think we still can.  This isn't the edifice to do it.  We -- I --\", \"Well, you know, we -- I mean, we have -- look, we have a market that's much more fragmented in a much larger country.  We have people who want to exercise more choice in their benefits design.  We have people who have higher expectations than what many people are willing to acquiesce to in other countries, and the one final point I'd make is that the structures in Obamacare that I've talked about tonight, the narrow networks, the closed drug formulators, I guarantee you they're going to be showing up in your commercial plans in the next two years.  These structures will not be confined to Obamacare.  They will now migrate into the commercial marketplace.\", \"Look.  You know just one comment to follow up on what Doug said.  What Doug is talking about [unintelligible] reform, these are things we've been talking about for a decade and they're not a key feature of Obamacare, although they were in the law.  We could've done a lot of that without disrupting the entire commercial insurance marketplace these were  bipartisan ideas. I'm not sure that Obamacare is going to successfully implement them anyway.  I'll just give you one anecdote.  They have a new law that hospitals get penalized for readmission, so hospitals are admitting fewer patients.  When patients show up in the ER they're being put in what's called observation status.  They're sitting in the hospital for 36 hours and not being admitted and so since they're not admitted to the hospital, they're considered outpatient, so they're being hit with 20 percent co-pays on that.\", \"This isn't Obamacare, Doug.  These are ideas they could've done apart from disrupting the entire marketplace [unintelligible].\", \"Obamacare is a federalization of insurance, though.  That's what Obamacare is.  I mean, this was a feature added into Obamacare. [applause] We could've done that in separate bills.\", \"It's a bait and switch, they're arguing components  of Obamacare.  That's not the essence of what the law set out to do. They were thinking they were attached to Obamacare.  The Sunshine Act is part of Obamacare.\", \"You know, the recession lowered medical spending.  Let's be honest. [applause]\", \"You -- there's absolutely metrics around this program.  The problem is the administration doesn't want to release the numbers.  As far as the cancellations, you've made the point a few times.  It is 5 million.  It might be more.  All you need to do is look at the analyst reports around you at the United/Humana, which are very large insurers. And it comes to something very close to that.  So we know people had their policies outright canceled.  We know many millions more had them changed in substantive ways, where it's no longer affordable to them.\", \"And we also -- we've seen costs go up in Massachusetts.  And Massachusetts was a market that was saturated with providers.  So it was easy to get leverage on them and burn them down.  It's going to be a little harder to do that in Obamacare, but I think they'll get there.\", \"Most of the cost control provisions in this law form [unintelligible] transfer risk to providers.  That's how the law seeks to control cost.  That's what accountable peer organizations [spelled phonetically] [unintelligible] bundle payment share savings.  It's all forms of capitation, and that's what we're [spelled phonetically] seeing in the marketplace.  That's why doctors are selling them back to hospitals, so they can form larger entities and take that capitated risk.  If you think that's a good idea, then you're more than welcome.\", \"If I were to -- if I were asked to distill downObamacare's essential flaw, it would simply be this, the law tries to exert so much control over aspects of medicine and health care that it's subject to so much heterogeneity and individualism that nobody should ever have thought that they could be micromanaged from a remote bureaucracy in Washington in a big piece of legislation.  The result is what you're seeing, an over- engineering that may have started out elegant on someone's flowcharts but became undone when it was subjected to political realities and the marketplace.  And it has -- and the marketplace had to conform to its rules. And the result is a massive exercise in unintended  consequences and a health insurance product that clearly people don't want.  People are saying this is just a rough start, but I will tell you this will get worse as this scheme unfolds.  There  already evidence plans arent entering the market in 2015, premiums certainly will rise next year, probably not as much as we thought because of the reinsurance pools, but those pools eventually go away.  Small businesses will dump people once their grandfathering is up at the end of this year, and you're going to see small businesses' cancellation notifications.  Networks and drug formulators will have to be narrowed further next year as this whole market gets repriced  off the second cheapest plan in every state.  And these structures in Obamacare that are so unappealing will start to evolve into the commercial marketplace just like the Part D  structures involved in tier commercial drug plans.  2014 was the high water mark for this scheme.  The insurance part will only get worse from here.  And this is hardly the ambition that is that its architects had in mind.  Obamacare surely will help some people. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 - Those below 200 percent of the federal poverty level will be helped by this I think, but a lot more will be hurt as they find themselves spending more money than they previously did to buy their way out of this scheme.  We didn't have to hurt some people to help some people in this country, but that's precisely what we did.\", 'I just wanted to see how I was doing.']\n",
      "[\"Well, the reason that I wrote the book is that I think the key to succeeding, to find out what works.  And the best way to find out what works is to fail and find out what doesn't.  And I would say we are finding out what doesn't work.\", 'To hear Doug Kamerow describe it, it\\'s amazing, and I want to sign up.  But, you know, these debates often tend to sort of devolve into \"Who doesn\\'t want people to die?\" So that\\'s not actually what\\'s on the table here.  The issue is not \"Are Democrats Socialists?  Are Republicans stupid and venal  and terrible people?\"  The issue is, \"Is this law, Obamacare, accomplishing what it set out to do?  Is it making Americans better off, and can it survive in its current form?\"  As you listen to the administration, it\\'s impossible for Obamacare to fail because every time they don\\'t hit some number that they\\'ve been promoting, they just change the terms and redefine its success as whatever\\'s already happened.  So, for example, just a few months ago, Kathleen Sebelius, who\\'s the secretary of Health and Human Services, was saying that success in the exchanges was seven million people signed up by March 2014.  And then they had a few problems with the exchanges, and then suddenly success wasn\\'t having seven million people signed up, success was having a healthy demographic mix in the pool -- in the insurance pools on the exchanges. Then they said that we got -- needed about 40 percent of the people to be young adults, which is between the ages of 18 and 35.  And then we got some data on the demographics.  And so far about 20 to 25 percent of the people who\\'ve signed up are young adults, and we got many more old people than we expected, which, for a few reasons that  should be fairly obvious, could make   insurance cost a lot more than we were hoping, so in the most recent conference call, they said that success would be signing up as many people as possible, which is this beautifully circular reference, right, of however many people you\\'ve signed up is the number that was possible.  It\\'s the self- licking ice cream cone of policy programs.  But for the rest of us, I don\\'t think it\\'s enough for Obamacare to merely exist.  It has to actually do something and do something that we want.  So what did we want?  What were we promised?  We were promised lower costs for government and individuals, and we\\'ve heard some of that. The administration likes to claim that this has already happened.  This hasn\\'t.  Health when Barack Obama was a junior state senator from Illinois.  He had not even been Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - elected to the U.S. Senate, much less to the presidency.  You see a big decline in 2005 to 2007 -- in 2003 to 2005, another between 2007 and 2009, but it actually leveled off in 2010 right when Obamacare comes in and cost growth is kind of bumping along if you look at the OECD figures on that.  Kaiser  projects -- you remember we heard that the average family was going to save $2,500 a year on their premiums?  That didn\\'t happen. Kaiser is now projecting that premiums  will go up.  We wanted people to get healthier as a result of this law, but then we got the Oregon Medicaid Study, which is the gold standard in studies of Medicaid, and it looked at the three things you really want to look at, in preventative care, it looked at hypertension control, cholesterol control, and it showed no statistically significant results. More than half of the expansion in Obamacare comes through Medicaid.  We wanted people with preexisting conditions, all of these millions of people with preexisting conditions we were told were out there to be able to  buy insurance.  But when they set up pools in order to cover people with preexisting conditions, they were expecting to get 400,000 people between  2010 and 2013, instead they got a quarter of that number, and they only managed to get that by lowering their requirements and doing an aggressive outreach campaign to sign more people up.  And we wanted expanded health care coverage, right?  But at this point, we can\\'t even say that there are more people insured right now than there were on January 15, 2013.  We -- the administration says that there have been four million people added to Medicaid, but half of those people came in states that didn\\'t even do the Medicaid expansion.  So definitionally they were already eligible for Medicaid.  Of the other states, some of those people were already eligible or may even be renewing their coverage. The administration can\\'t even say that these are people who are getting new coverage. Some of them may just be going back on to Medicaid just like they were last year.  We have 2.2 million people on the exchanges, but five million people had their policies cancelled.  No one, I think, predicted that at this point this late in the game you wouldn\\'t even know whether we\\'ve increased the insurance numbers and the administration refuses to certify that that is actually happening.  Meanwhile, we were not supposed to hurt anyone who had insurance, right?  If you liked your plan and you liked your doctor, you could keep them.  We all know that that has not happened, so five million people have had their plans cancelled, and many people who are buying new plans are seeing that their doctors are not -- the best hospitals and doctors in their area have been kicked off the network in order to keep the premium costs down on the exchanges.  So, it was also supposed to be really popular, , right?  Because we had all of this great stuff, this giant Rube Goldberg apparatus layered on top.  We didn\\'t take anything away, we only gave. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - And it\\'s kind of time for a Dr. Phil moment,  how is that working for you?  Nothing is working the way the administration said.  So you can say it does not really matter whether it is unpopular, right?  The point is not to be popular, and yes, some people have gotten hurt, but you can\\'t make an omelet without breaking eggs, right?  It was never reasonable to think that everyone was going to get to keep the doctors and the plans that they wanted.  Something had to change and this is a foundation for something better.  But this foundation has so many cracks you cannot build a healthy structure on top of it.  Just look at everything the administration has had to do in the last few months just to keep the law running.  They had to delay the employer mandate and the enforcement, apparently because they couldnt even figure out how to make this regulation work.  It may never go into effect, which means we\\'ll lose millions of people who were supposed to get coverage expanded through [unintelligible] and the cost will go up to the government.  They delayed the Spanish language website, and now apparently part of it is written in Spanglish.  Despite the fact that Hispanics are a major constituency for insurance expansion.  They delayed the small business exchanges. They\\'ve allowed people to keep plans that were supposed to be illegal because they weren\\'t real insurance Kathleen Sebelius told us.  They\\'ve delayed deadlines over and over again.  They\\'ve done all these things by asserting emergency powers by doing administrative fixes through executive fiat, and yeah fair enough, Obamacare is certainly an emergency, but all of these changes have had the effect of undermining and destabilizing the law that they think is so important.  Theyve had to do these things even though they know it makes the insurance pools less actuarily  sound, because they can\\'t face the political backlash.  And what happens when Republicans get into office and I assume they, too, think Obamacare is an emergency and could be fixed with some executive orders.  Essentially they\\'ve made it so that Republicans can undo two-thirds of this law with a stroke of the presidential pen.  Obamacare is Now Beyond Rescue.  The administration has destroyed their own law in order to save it.

We have a different set of doctors and nurses and patients and all sorts of things, and that's why I like the idea of a kind of very American - - we're going to have the government insure your financial losses after a certain point, but we're going to leave you out there as a market driven consumer, making choices of whatever health care you want when you get sick.\", \"But that's actually true, Jonathan.

It did it in its first year, which I'm not clear we're doing now.  But in other ways, it didn't do what it was expecting to do.  For example, they had expected to really lower the rate of uncompensated care, which was something that you hear a lot about.  And they did lower it somewhat, but it came in at only about 40 percent lower than the projections -- instead of the 100 percent lower than theyd basically been expecting.  Costs are still going up.  Medical bankruptcies don't seem to have abated nearly as much as you would think, given how much insurance -- you know, they've now -- they're now the -- by far the lowest rate of uninsured people in the nation.  But Massachusetts is also a little bit hard to compare to the rest of the country.  They already had the lowest rate of uninsured people in the country before they started this.  They've got a weird mix of employers -- you know, a lot more employer-based insurance than you're going to get in Texas.

And the cost reductions have been occurring across the board, not just in Medicare, a recent paper at Brookings suggests it's probably due to a combination of the recession and technological slowdown,  we haven't had a lot of innovation for whatever reason in the last few years.  Going forward, there are things like accountable care organizations that think they're not looking as great as they thought that they were.  Other issues with electronic medical records, also not looking as great as we had hoped.  And some Medicare pilot programs. And eventually, the comparative effectiveness for [unintelligible] -- slow Medicare costs and it doesn't come down on its own.

And I know we're all hoping to make it there, but is that politically sustainable when that's the minority of the voting base and when they're already getting most of the transfers and growing every day?  And when the budget is under strain, when we have to find ways to cut, I do question that.  I question whether in 20 years we're still going to be gung ho about giving money to people over the age of 50 instead of people over the age of 65.\", \"So, I don't want to go into an anecdote; we can talk about people who just got coverage and there are people who have and couldnt get it before and Im happy for them, or I could talk about the people who have written me and said now I can't afford coverage and I had it before what do I do, and I don't have anything to tell them.  That's not really the assessment of the law.  They're just individual stories.  It doesnt tell us how its going. And the question isn't whether the status quo was bad, or anyone on this stage is a bad person.  I think we all didnt want the status quo.  We're all good people.  We all want to help the other Americans to be as healthy as possible.  The question is whether the law is undermining its own goals.  And to think about going forward, we, you know, Mr. Chait says its now  here.  In fact, we still have a long way to go with a bunch of unpopular stuff that is going to happen.  Small businesses are starting to get a wave of cancellations that are going to come through the  year, and they're being asked for a lot more money.  A lot of that is due to Obamacare.  The Cadillac tax, 40 percent surcharge on generous health insurance is especially hard on companies with old sick people, but a lot of benefits managers are saying basically everyone is going to have to go to light plans and scale down rather than get hit by that tax.  Weve got comparative effectiveness research which is going to start determining what sorts of things Medicare will reimburse at what rates.

Yes, you may have to break an omelet to make eggs, but the administration is not going to tell the eggs that, and the Republicans certainly aren't going to make the eggs crack itself. So, if we are not willing to impose the pain, and so far we haven't, this law cannot survive.  It is set up as a giant piece of interlocking machinery.  You can't just rip the carburetor out and hope that its still working.  That is why Obamacare is beyond rescue, because we are not willing to face the hard choices the law made necessary.\"]\n",

Any moments of doubt you have as you're getting away from meat are quickly replaced by being very, very glad that you've broken a bad habit.\", 'Free now and glad of it.', 'Gene Baur --', '-- the president of Farm Sanctuary. [applause]', 'Thank you.  Gene will be talking about the ethical and environmental issues.  I\\'m going to talk about health.  In 2009, the Archives of Internal Medicine published a massive research study.  The NIH-AARP study had a half a million participants.  They were followed for 10 years.  Some of them didn\\'t eat meat or didn\\'t eat very much.  Some ate quite a lot of meat.  And what they showed was that among those eating the most meat, the risk of dying of cancer was increased by fully 20 percent and heart disease deaths were increased by 27 percent among men and 50 percent among women. And in 2012, the Archives of Internal Medicine published another study. One hundred and twenty thousand people. This was coordinated all at Harvard University. And it Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - showed exactly the same thing: if you ate a lot of meat, your risk of dying of heart disease was much higher; your risk of dying of cancer was higher. And studies have clearly shown that people who don\\'t eat meat cut their cancer risk by anywhere between 12 and 40 percent.  Well, why would meat be linked to cancer?  Hold that thought for a second.  I grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and I come from a long line of cattle ranchers.  My dad raised cattle, my grandpa raised cattle, as far back as I can trace.  Now, my dad did not like the cattle business.  He objected to it a great deal.  He went to medical school.  He spent his life treating diabetes in Fargo, North Dakota.  But we still ate like we were in the cattle business. Every day it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and corn, except for special occasions when it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and peas. [laughter] And my grandfather had a heart attack, and he then became quite severely demented, and he died.  And we took that as normal because he was old.  He was 65.  My other three grandparents lived longer, but each one of them succumbed to severe dementia year after year after year, and they all finally died.  And none of us thought that maybe food had something to do with this.  Now, I got my first wake-up call at Fairview Hospital in Minneapolis, where I was the autopsy assistant.  One day a man died in a hospital of a massive heart attack, probably from eating hospital food, but that\\'s another story. [laughter] And the pathologist came in the room, and he knew that I was headed for medical school.  So he removed a section of ribs, and he sliced open one of the coronary arteries, and he said, \"Look inside.\" And it looked like chewing gum in this coronary artery, but when I felt it, it was hard like a rock.  And he said, \"That\\'s atherosclerosis.  That\\'s your morning sausage, Neal.  That\\'s your bacon, Neal.  That\\'s your roast beef in there.\"  And he said, \"We see the beginnings of this in three quarters of people by age 23,\" which happened to be the age I was at the time.  And he wrote up all his findings.  He left the room.  And I had to clean up.  I took the ribs.  I put them back in the chest.  I tried to make them fit with the other ribs.  And I sewed up the skin, cleaned up, and I went up to the cafeteria, where they were serving ribs for lunch. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - [laughter] Now, fast forwarding a little bit, a little -- a few years later Dr. Dean Ornish brought in to a research study people who had atherosclerosis, they had narrowed arteries, he took the meat out of their diets, and something happened that had never been shown before.  The arteries actually started opening up again, so much that you could see a measurable difference in 82 percent of patients in the first year with no surgery and no medications. Grass-fed beef does not do that, including the beef my family raised.  It just doesn\\'t work.  Eating chicken and eating fish just can\\'t do that.  And so my research team tried this same kind of diet for people who wanted to lose weight, and NIH funded us to try this kind of diet for people who had diabetes.  And it works better than any other diet. Why?  Because when you get meat out of the diet, meat has fat in it and every gram of fat has nine calories.  That\\'s its job.  You get it out of the diet, and you get rid of a lot of calories.  Meat has zero fiber, none.  Fiber fills you up without calories, and if the foods you have dont have it, youre going to eat too much, and youre going to gain weight. Why diabetes?  Because getting the meat out of the diet helps fat to drain out of the muscle cells, allowing insulin to start working on its own. And we saw something I never saw in medical school, which is diabetes improving, sometimes even disappearing for all intents and purposes. And when we look at broad population studies, the meat-eaters are always the heaviest group, and the people who eat no meat are always the thinnest.  Diabetes is the same way.  Its about 8 percent of adult meat-eaters, and among vegetarians, 3 percent.  High blood pressure, exactly the same.  You just dont see it very much in people following vegetarian diets.  But why more cancer?  Well, when we heat up meat, something happens that doesnt happen with plant foods, and thats that carcinogens called heterocyclic amines form in the meat, especially chicken, but any kind of skeletal muscle, which is what meat is.  But thats not the only carcinogen.  We also see polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, theres heme iron, there are a lot of things.  Plus meat doesnt have fiber that protects you.  It doesnt have any vitamin C.  Its low in important antioxidants. So its like tobacco.  We know for sure tobacco causes lung cancer, but were not 100 percent sure which part of the tobacco smoke is responsible. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - We know clearly that meat causes cancer in other parts of your body.  The stomach, the intestinal tract -- but were not sure.  Is it the HCAs? The PAHs? Were not quite sure yet. I asked Dr. Richard Leakey, the famous paleoanthropologist, how did we get into meat- eating?  And he said humans are naturally primates.  Were great apes.  We are not carnivores, and we ate things we could pick with our hands, until the Stone Age gave us stone tools, and meat-eating began, he believes, as scavenging.  Lying with leafs and bones, we would scrape it up with these stone tools that we now had.  Problem: we have pre-Stone Age bodies that get cancer and get heart disease when you eat meat.  Of course, if your life expectancy is 35 or 40, it doesnt matter, but if you live to a mid-age and beyond, then these things matter a lot.  And what matters now is Alzheimers disease.  We have now learned that a diet high in saturated fat -- thats the bad fat in meat -- is linked to Alzheimers disease in studies in Chicago, in New York, in Finland. And meat-eaters actually have very poor nutrition.  Yes, they get protein, but they dont get many vitamins, they dont get any complex carbohydrates, theyre missing fiber.  A vegetarian diet gives you all the protein youre going to need, plus many more vitamins, many more minerals.  So Bill Clinton did.  Al Gore did it.  Bob Barker did it.  Serena Williams did it.  Since 2004 meat-eating has dropped by 9 percent.  Thats where were going.  Thats the future.  Thank you very much. [applause]', \"Well, I don't want to speak for Chris.  But having read the documents that he circulated in advance, he had the psychiatric issues before he went vegetarian, while he was vegetarian, and after.  And if I read them correctly, he said that eating cholesterol was not sufficient, that he also needed religion in order to fight his way back.  And I say this not to mock it, but to say that these problems were pre-existing before the diet change. And the studies that he cited were observational studies.  We have put this to the test. We worked with the insurance company Geico in ten different cities.  And we introduced plant-based diets for about 300 people, and we measured levels of depression, levels of anxiety.  They got better.  And we have now about three randomized trials along these lines.  People get better.  And as people who have done this, they find they feel more energetic, which is why a lot of athletes are doing it. Dental health acts exactly the same.  In fact, even the study that he cited, when you looked over the longest period of time, the vegetarians kept their teeth more while the meat-eaters tended to lose them.  This is not a reason to have a --\", \"Well, let me take issue with you there, if you don't mind.\", \"I'm going to suggest that, Joel, if I went to your farm, and I got one of your chickens who, as I'm sure you'll agree, they are not natural chickens. These are -- these are freaks of breeding over time.  They are bred to become obese. And if I took one of them who maybe never had even any chemical given to that chicken, but if I kill them and cooked them, these same heterocyclic amines, these clear- cut carcinogens, would form on your chickens just like any other.  So, regardless of whether it's organic or not, cooking skeletal muscle produces carcinogens.  And that's why every epidemiologist agrees that vegetarians have less cancer.  There's just no question about it.\", \"Vitamin B12 is not made by animals.  It's not made by plants.  It is made by bacteria. And historically, one theory is that the bacteria on plants, on the soil, on our fingers, in our mouths, give you that 2.4 micrograms, the tiny amount that you need.  The other theory -- and people have shown that the bacteria in the human digestive tract actually produce absorbable B12, but in modern civilization, most of those bacteria are gone. They're too low.  They produce the B12 so you can't absorb it.

The truth is, nobody really knows for sure. But what we do know is that most B12 people in hematology clinics are meat-eaters. And they are low on B12 because they are not absorbing it.

      "[\"Got to go with the leafy greens.  Kale is what it's about.\", 'Thank you very much, and thank you for this opportunity.  It\\'s wonderful to be discussing this issue.  Most people don\\'t think enough about our food choices and about the animals who suffer terribly for the meat, milk and eggs that is produced in this country.  I grew up eating animals without really thinking about it.  My parents ate animals, my brothers and sisters ate animals.  Everybody around me was doing it, so I just adopted the habit, without really thinking about it.  But as I started learning about the fact of how these animals were treated and about the fact that I could live well without eating animals, I made the choice to become a vegan.  I did that back in 1985. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - It\\'s one of the best choices I\\'ve ever made.  And the fact that we can live well without eating other animals, without causing harm, I think is the key question here, the key point. If we can live well without causing harm, why wouldn\\'t we do it?  And the main reason is that we just sort of grow up doing it, without thinking about it.  So, the question is, how can we live well?  How do we want to feel when we treat other animals the way we treat them?  And on these factory farms, they\\'re treated horribly.  I visited farms across the country.  I\\'ve seen animals put in these small cages where they can\\'t move.  You walk into these farms, and you\\'re hit with this horrible stench.  They\\'re living in their feces.  They\\'re screaming to get out of their cages, and they live that way their whole lives, and then they\\'re killed young so that we can eat them.  And, you know, when people see this, they don\\'t like it.  And oftentimes people say, \"Don\\'t tell me.  I don\\'t want to know,\" when the issue of factory farming comes up, because it is so upsetting and because we are compassionate, and because we are hardwired to have empathy. When we look at other animals, and we see them suffer, when we look at other people, and we see them suffer, we feel something.  That is one of the best parts of our humanity, this empathy, this ability to feel something when we look into somebody else\\'s face.  When the executioners at the Salem witch hunts were charged with killing witches, they were told, Don\\'t look into their face, because if you do, they\\'ll cast a spell on you, and you won\\'t be able to kill them.  Basically, when you look into their face, there\\'s empathy, there\\'s a connection, there\\'s an understanding that there\\'s a living creature there.  And when you abuse another animal or another person for that matter, there\\'s this tendency to try to denigrate them and to say, well, they don\\'t really have feelings.  They don\\'t really deserve any better.  And that\\'s unfortunately what has happened to farm animals.  There are these misconceptions and incorrect ideas about animals on farms not being smart.  For instance, people think turkeys are so dumb they\\'ll go outside and they\\'ll drown in the rain.  This is one of these myths that people say, probably to feel better about mistreating animals. But we\\'ve raised turkeys at Farm Sanctuary for many years.  They go outside. They\\'ve never gone out and drowned in the rain. [laughter] They enjoy, you know, going indoors and outdoors.  And when the animals come to us, they\\'re often afraid because they\\'ve only known cruelty.  But when they start Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - recognizing they\\'re in a safe place, and they start being treated with kindness, they respond.  And it\\'s a beautiful thing to see.  We had a turkey at our farm in California we used to call Lydia the Hugging Turkey, because you\\'d go out into the barnyard and kneel down, and she would come up to you, and she would crane her neck around your neck like she was giving you a hug.  So these animal show companionship and friendship. And I\\'m not the only one that has seen this.  People who visit Farm Sanctuary and work there have seen this.  Jane Goodall, also, is now speaking out about the fact that these animals have feelings and much more intellectual and emotional depth than we ever knew before.  She said, \"Farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined.  They are individuals in their own right.\"  Now, on factory farms, these animals are treated horribly.  I think there is widespread support among this panel even among those who think that it\\'s okay to eat animals, that factory farming is an abomination, that it should not occur.  It is outside the bounds of acceptable conduct.  The real challenge is discussing, what about animals who are not treated so badly?  Should we eat them?  And I would suggest, no, we should not.  We do not need to.  We do not need to cause them harm. And whenever animals are seen as consumable products, there is a tendency to treat them not very well.  I\\'ve been to factory farms, I have been to small farms, and even on these farms that are purported to be humane, there are significant problems. Whenever the animals are seen as consumables, the relationship is one of exploitation, and that is a huge problem that we need to face, and something we don\\'t need to do. In addition, animal production is very wasteful.  The United Nations came out with a report a couple years ago talking about how animal agriculture is one of the top contributors to the most serious environmental problems we\\'re facing on the planet, including climate change.  And these animals are routinely fed antibiotics as well, so we have these antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are now developing on these farms.  And so these are other problems associated with this attitude of looking at animals just as commodities.  So, eating animals is bad for the animals.  It is bad for the environment.  It is bad for us.  It is not necessary.  We can live and be healthy on eating plants alone.  I urge you to vote yes on the motion that we should not eat anything with a face.  So thank you very much.', 'Yeah, well, I --', \"-- Ive been a vegan since 1985, and I have not been very religious about taking B12 supplements.

And these were animal foods that were not necessarily produced in factory farms, so just the animal foods were correlated with human health problems, including cancers.  And so that was not factory-farmed meat.  It was range-fed meat or grazing animals, and they were still problems.', 'Well, I think over the course of our history, weve done what weve had to do to survive, and often that has been eating meat, but its also sometimes been eating other people. And weve also done a lot of things over the course of our history that have not been very good, you know?  You know, you think of institutions like slavery. And as time goes, we come to look at these things more critically and we start making decisions and choices that are, I think, more humane.  And when it comes to animals, they have feelings like we do. Theyre not that much different than we are, and theres been attempts to rationalize and say, well, they are different.  They dont use tools, for example.  Then Jane Goodall Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 - found that animals were using tools, and we had to change our thinking and say, well, they dont use language; but now we see that these other animals use language.

I agree with the point that life often comes from death.  You know, animals die, plants die, they go back into the soil.  But dying is one thing.  Killing is an entirely different thing.\", \"Well, I mean, I don't know the science about that.  I kind of doubt it.

And so I think bison should be back there.  And when we're growing plants and eating them directly, it requires far less acreage.  So a lot of wild space could be left wild.  And veganic farming is not necessarily no animals.  There are wild animals.  And you're interacting with animals but in a less harmful way.  And that's what it's about, its doing as good as you can, causing as little harm as possible, and this is an evolving process.

You can get beans and rice and -- you know, cooking also is something that weve lost sight of, and its another part of this process -- is preparing food.

It's good to eat a variety, like beans, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and things like that.  But, you know, with factory farming, to the point that was raised earlier, most people in this country who are eating animals are eating factory-farmed animals.

If we think that that is unacceptable, we need to vote yes on the motion not to eat anything with a face.  And going more philosophically, this is ultimately about our relationship with other animals. Historically, humans have eaten other animals, and as I mentioned, in tough times people have eaten other people.  Weve done a lot of very bad things, but when we have choices, when we have options, when we can live in a way that does not cause harm, why wouldnt we?  The word humane and slaughter dont go very well together, and when you try to rationalize that these animals are there to be killed and eaten by us, many other bad things do happen.  And I have been to a number of factory farms, I have been to a number of small farms, where animals are put in small areas, where theyre put  in cages even, at these so-called humane farms. When the animals are seen as commodities, and as edibles, they are not treated with respect.  That is bad for the animals, and I would also suggest it is bad for us.  Im not saying everybody who eats animals is a mean person.  You know, we all grow, we all learn, we evolve, and when we learn, we can do better, and thats what its ultimately about. Its about intent. And if you vote yes on this, that doesnt mean youve got to be vegan tomorrow.  This is a principle that we should not eat anything with a face.  These are other animals.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 4 -', \"That'll be fine.\", 'Thanks, John.  Mike German has put the problem, I think, as directly as it could be. When, if ever, is it appropriate for the government to gather data on large populations, everybody in order to make us more safe? So that\\'s the question.  You can call it spying on everybody, if you like, and he does.  But it\\'s not as unusual or as ineffective, and certainly not illegal as he suggests.  And I\\'ll take his challenge of saying, \"When has spying on everybody -- when has gathering all of the data on everybody, innocent or not, helped us stop terrorist attacks?\" and let\\'s take the Zazi case, the Times Square bombing case, the Underwear Bomber. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - When I was at DHS, one of the things we fought very hard to do was something that I think Mike German would call spying on everyone.  We said we want the airlines to give us the travel reservation information and the passport information on everybody who\\'s flying into the United States; everybody, not just the suspects. We need to know who\\'s coming here.  We use that data to compare the names and the information that was on there to the databases in which we had information about people we were worried about, or patterns that we were worried about.  And then when those people arrived, a few of them, half of a percent, would end up spending about 45 minutes talking to a customs agent about why they were coming to the United States, who would try to determine whether this person was a threat.  That was a routine practice.  And most of us just, you know, it\\'s welcome home, and you move on. But a few people, they couldn\\'t stop everybody, but they could stop a few people.  They used this data to decide who was worth worrying about.  Now, let\\'s take the Underwear Bomber. The people who did airport security had no information about him.  And not surprisingly, didn\\'t check in very carefully, and he got right past them.  It turned out that when he was due to land, he had already been flagged by the customs folks who had access to that data as somebody that they, through checking back in databases, were able to identify as somebody that they were worried about.  So he would have been caught if we\\'d had the information earlier, and he would have been caught when he landed.  That\\'s, indeed, probably why al-Qaeda wanted to blow up the plane before he had to get past the customs officials. The same thing is true for the Times Square Bomber, where after the bombing, the FBI got a phone number.  They asked our guys, do you have that phone number?  Did anybody with that phone number come into the United States?  Turned out that he\\'d given that same phone number to the airline for his reservation data. The department was able to identify him, provide the data, start a man hunt.  And then he got on the plane and was about to leave the country.  The only reason we caught him is because we had data on everybody who was getting on that plane, and we were able to run the information in the background and determine, this is the guy we\\'re looking for.  He\\'s on the plane.  That plane had already closed its doors when the customs officials went on to pull him off.  He would have gotten away, but for the data which Mike German calls, \"Spying on everybody.  I would call it \"gathering data that is already Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - in the hands of third parties,\" given it to the airlines, they\\'re going to use it to decide whether you get chicken or tornadoes, and whether you get that 3 inches of extra leg room.  You know, I\\'m happy to have that information also used to make sure I actually arrive at my destination. And it seems to me that the intrusion -- you can call a lot of scary things, but the fact is, at the end of the day, it\\'s information that I willingly shared with the airlines, and I\\'m happy that they\\'re using it to protect me as well.  That\\'s  the real question we have here, is, can we use data that we\\'ve given to a third party, can the government use data that you\\'ve given to a third party, to try to find terrorists?  We do that all the time.  The NSA program is probably the most aggressive use of that.  But at the end of the day, this is billing information you\\'ve given -- we\\'ve all given to the phone companies.  It is searched by law enforcement outside of the NSA program 1.3 million times a year.  What the NSA did, at the end of the day, through the program and through the safeguards that they established for that program, they required -- Yes, we gather the information, but no one can search it without articulable, reasonable suspicion passed on by a lawyer.  It\\'ll be audited.  A limited number of people will have access to it.  At the end of the day, 300 numbers went into that on a given year.  500 -- there were searches to find who they were talking to.  500 numbers came out as potentially suspicious.  And only then did the government go out to try to find out whose name was associated with those phone numbers.  500 people versus -- and all used for terrorist purposes, all carefully scrubbed versus 1.3 million searches done by law enforcement every day without bringing 1984 home to America.  Thank you.', 'Theres no doubt that when the government collects data, everybody in the democracy ought to be concerned and want to make sure that it is handled in as privacy-protected a fashion as possible, consistent with actually having it be effective.  The difficulty here is -- or the protections here are built in to the back end of the system.  That is to say the government has the data, but just because it has it doesnt mean its allowed to look at it.  Its set up a whole set of rules, court enforced, aggressively audited, limited number of people who can get access to this data, and clear rules for when they can do it. To make it much more like the rules that apply to ordinary searches by law enforcement, which is you have a suspicion, and you ask a question about the person or the -- in this case, the phone number that you have a suspicion about.  They dont have any ability to look at people for --', 'Yes, absolutely.', \"Yeah.  I -- I have to say, there's a little confusion here.  I hear Mike German saying, you know, all of these data collection programs are bad.  And I think I hear Professor Cole saying, oh, no, those are all -- spying on us is fine if you're gathering data about travel reservations or border crossings.  All of that data isn't the kind of spying on us that we're opposed to.  We're opposed to this one program that relates to NSA. And I think that suggests that they really don't have the courage of their convictions, that information that is available to third parties should be used for security purposes. That's the position that we are arguing here.  And I think we've done a good job.  On the question of whether NSA and its program responds to a very real problem, let's remember how they got started with this program. In the months before 9/11, NSA was listening to communications in Yemen, and they heard calls from an al-Qaeda operative.  What they didn't know is that the al-Qaeda operative was planning the hijacking in the United States.  And those calls were coming from inside the United States, because they had no way to look inside the United States to see where these calls were coming from.  If they had known months before the attack that somebody was inside the United States at that high rank within al-Qaeda, there would have been an all-points bulletin for that person.  They would have found him, and probably the attack would not have occurred.  When you have a failure like that, you ask, what can we do to make sure that never happens again?  And this program responds in part to that concern.  And I think that's a lesson that is written in blood for the national security agency.\", 'A few people here and there, but the NSA did not know because they had no tools to know it, to say, \"Well, if somebody else had done their job perfectly, you wouldn\\'t have needed this program,\" is to say, you know, \"If the world were perfect, we wouldn\\'t need counterterrorism.\"', \"And I don't -- can I --\", '-- a point where I think we do agree, of course the government should wherever possible be put to reasonable suspicion before it looks into individual activities.  That is true even of the NSA program which is the one that you have chosen as the poster child for this issue. No one is allowed to search this data without a reasonable articulable  suspicion.  So the question really boils down to \"Are you allowed to collect it first and put it in the database?\"  And, look, the question I thought was an excellent one, \"Why would you do that if there\\'s an alternative?\" and the problem is there\\'s not a good alternative.  The alternative would be to leave it with the companies and search it there when we have some reason to be concerned about that individual phone number, but the companies Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 - get rid of that data on their own schedule.  Theyve got no obligation to keep it, and they dont.  Second, there are -- we got rid of Ma Bell.  There is no one phone company you can go to search.  No one computer system.  So you would have to try to do this kind of analysis of whos talking to whom outside the United States and in -- youd have to go jumping from system to system to system to system. Its a nightmare.  If you thought the healthcare.gov was bad, building this system would be worse.', 'Making it hard for the mic runner.', 'I was around for the creation of the legal structure around intelligence, and it was a remarkable achievement for the United States.  No other country thought you could do intelligence under law.  We set up a program that was designed to prevent the abuses that had occurred in the 60s and 70s, and by and large it has done it. But everyone knows -- everyone here knows you cant do intelligence in the open because the people youre trying gather it on will be watching more closely than anyone else to figure out how to defeat it.  At some point you have to say, Ive got to trust somebody.  In this case we are trusting 14 judges, two different administrations, committees headed by different parties over almost a decade.  At some point, you have to say, yes, I would love it if I could know about this, but I realize that everything I know about Al Qaeda knows about, and I have to trust somebody.

Once you\\'ve put it in a proper framework, they were only doing, after all, 300 identifier searches in a year.  It was not a problem doing those searches.  It was not a problem collecting and putting the data into a database.

We live -- that's the world we live in, and the technology that we all enjoy has empowered them.  You couldn't have pulled off 9/11 30 years earlier.  What I'm really suggesting is that having empowered everyone, and increasingly empowered people on the other side of the world who hate us, to cause serious damage here, we need to let the government use the technical tools that are created by lower cost for storing data to offset the advantage that the terrorists have. That's -- it seems to me you don't have to have a security clearance to have a commonsense appreciation of what the threat is and how empowered terrorists are these days.\", 'Thanks, John.  You know, when I started as general counsel of the National Security Agency, Janet Reno, the attorney general, came out for a visit.  And this was a high- stakes meeting.  She was deeply skeptical about whether this spy agency could be trusted at all, whether it understood what the Fourth Amendment was.  And we were walking through an operations center with her when the director stopped, looked at a corporal who was going over some intercepts, and he said to the corporal, \"Stand up, sir.  And \"what do you do if you find a communication by an American?\" that corporal plucked out of a mass of people doing the intercepts, said, \"Sir, we segregate that.  We cannot disseminate it unless there\\'s foreign intelligence in it. We must take the -- we must anonymize the data and destroy it if there\\'s no intelligence in it,\" which was the rule.

But the director was absolutely sure that you could pick anybody out of that agency and ask him what the rules were.  He would tell you and would be proud of the fact that he knew them and would obey them.  That is the culture of the National Security Agency.  If you give Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 - them the rules, they will follow those rules.  They have -- we have given them rules in this context.  They are subject to lots of constraints.  We cannot say, \"All of this public, or we might as well not try to gather intelligence.

I don\\'t want to hyperventilate about it, but I\\'ve lived through enough of them to be able to recount some of the direct experiences.  And if that comes up in a Q&A, we\\'ll have to go through them in greater detail.  But they really do matter.  Turns out a terrorist plot is not that difficult to stop if you know about it, and finding out about it in the first place is by far the hardest step in the process. In the overwhelming number of incidents that we\\'ve had since 9/11, that original lead, what\\'s called the \"predication for further investigative steps,\" has come from electronic surveillance of one form or another, so these programs really do matter.  Second, and what I\\'m about to say I think is going to unite both sides of this debate.  Stewart and I have worked on these issues for a while.  We are for lawful surveillance, lawful forms of electronic surveillance, things which clearly backed up by the Constitution, by statute, and by court interpretation are permissible, so don\\'t for a second think that Stewart and I are arguing for anything that is illegal.  And since the other side I think is very likely not to argue in favor of illegal surveillance either, I think this is something that brings us together.  We are for lawful forms of surveillance. And there is an extensive body of law that governs when, how, where these systems can be deployed.  And this is not a legal seminar, but I can tell you that, that system has evolved in such a way, over the last 35 years, that it is really nothing short of an enormous success for the American privacy and civil liberties community.  It\\'s hard to believe, but it\\'s a fact that 35 years ago there was no statutory constraint and no jurisprudential constraint on the ability of the president of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance inside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes.  It was unfettered.  Now it\\'s fettered quite significantly, first with the creation of a FISA court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with -- and an act of 1978, and then adjusted in important ways with the FISA Modernization Acts of the last five years. And so this is something you really have to understand, if you take this in kind of broader historical context, an incredible amount of progress has been made, and these sorts of programs have been brought under the constraint of law where they were not previously.  Previously -- if these laws had never been passed, it was solely the powers of the president under the Constitution, Article 2 that permitted him to do this.  And those days are over.  Now there is a law which governs it, and many laws, in fact, and the court is involved in overseeing things which previously were exclusively within the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - domain of the president.  There are now checks and balances on his power to do that, and that is extraordinary progress.  And the third thing I want to say is how unusual this area is in Washington.  As I said, there\\'s partisan gridlock in here.  Name me another issue in public life, health care or taxation or entitlement reform or what to do in the Middle East, where you have the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary all unanimous about the contours and direction of a specific program. It\\'s remarkable that this happened, not just the three branches of government but in the case of the executive branch a set of policies and programs which have survived partisan transition.  So these programs which we have today emerged in the latter half of the Bush administration and have survived essentially unchanged into the Obama administration, two leaders who could not be more different.  And they are unchanged. And so this is where the other side of this debate really have a pretty tough argument because you have broad bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress, the two presidents of different parties, different characters, one, the current one, quite liberal and quite educated in Constitutional law -- he taught it, University of Chicago -- and the judiciary all backing up and saying it\\'s fine.  So what the other side has to do, and it\\'s a tough burden I think, is say, \"They\\'ve all got it wrong, we\\'ve got it right, we know better.  And I think frankly that\\'s a pretty high burden for them.  Thank you very much.', \"It's worth -- [applause] Richard Falkenrath: There's a few things that \\\\-- neither do Stewart or I.  We think it's effective in this case. And youve left out a few facts.  So this program, the one that draws your ire so strongly, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records. First point:  The Supreme Court has held, since the late '70s, that this data, like what number called what number at what time for how long is not privacy information. Getting it from the government is not a search.  Now, professor Cole and his scholarship on this is against that and thinks the Supreme Court got it wrong.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court, for 35 years, has held this consistently.  Second, going beyond what is strictly necessary from what the Supreme Court says, the Congress has authorized this Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - provision.  It's called section 215.  It was in the Patriot Act.  It amended the FISA court regulation.  People on your side of this debate were against it then, and you're still against it now.  215 was very controversial then.  It's still controversial now among the same people.  But finally, you leave out the fact that this program, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records for narrow counterterrorism purposes has been authorized 34 times by 14 different federal judges, who wrote, in writing, they said they would not have authorized it but for the safeguards in place.  And every 90 days, they have to do it again.\", \"Let me try to put this in terms everyone can understand the utility of this.  So professor Cole, Mike German, Stewart Baker, John, we're here at the same place, same time, participating in a complex operation.  I, in fact, never had a phone call with David Cole or -- nonetheless we're here, doing something relatively complicated.  Now, it turns out --\", 'Yes.  We talked to another person.', \"We talked to another person, who is in the audience, and was the coordinator of this. And now, here's -- do you understand why this data matters and why Mike Hayden would say that we want this information where you have no expectation of right to privacy. We talked to the coordinator of this debate, who then put us together, right?  That is how plots are unraveled.  They find out about one perp.  They look at the communications pattern, they identify the network, and they can diffuse the plot.  So imagine this was not a debate but a bombing.  This is how -- this call record data is how it gets unraveled and stopped.  And it's why it matters.  And it's not a video camera in the bedroom.  That is -- that is not a fair comparison, and I think you know it.  This data, for very good reasons, the government and the Congress and the court do not hold that you have the same expectations of the right to privacy as to you do in your bedroom.\", 'We have --', \"-- we have, in fact, stuck with that for information the Supreme Court deems personal privacy information.  We just don't for this category of information which you think should be categorized but the rest of the legal system in the United States doesn't.\", \"[inaudible] your standard still applies to content, right?  It still requires particularized approval to get the content. What we're talking about here is information which you or whoever have given to a third party, namely, a telecommunications provider, and that they have in their system to use for their purposes and, as Stewart explained, the government needs for its purposes from time to time.  So you're confusing the discussion by suggesting they're the same.  These are different categories of information.  And while you disagree with how the Supreme Court has ruled this, the entire system is built around this distinction.\", 'Its a lot of different things, and so I think were probably going to refer back to this telephone metadata question, and in that case, its true that the scale of it was classified, but it was disclosed to every member of Congress in writing twice, 2009 and 2011, where the administration -- the Department of Justice -- by the way, the Obama Department of Justice -- wrote that this program, which we need you to reauthorize, which they did, broad bipartisan majorities, will entail the collection of substantially every telephone call record in the country.  So they were told.  Now whether --', 'Yeah, so Congress --', '-- and if they didnt -- and they kept it secret -- it wasnt being hidden from them at that stage.  You can make an argument about an earlier program up to 2006, but for that program in writing they were told.', 'The \"they\" that you just described, \"They can put all this together, they can understand --\"', 'Yeah.  It sounds a lot more like Google than the government because -- and you have to take this -- this is actually a serious point.  This is not the case that the government is tracking everything you do and can put it all together.  And the government doesn\\'t care what you\\'re doing. They\\'re actually, though, in the last 10 years, with the explosion of social media and the explosion of terms of service agreement and informed consent that no one reads, is  -- what you just described emerging in the private sector, with a legal basis being a document which no one can really read and give informed consent to; unlike the program we\\'re talking about, which is subject to extreme safeguards, rooted in the Constitution, backed up by both chambers of Congress and by the judiciary.  And so I think you\\'ve really got to shift your terms of your argument here.  This isn\\'t the \\'70s with the FBI running around at the behest of Richard Nixon probing into people\\'s lives.  This is a world where the government is tightly regulated and overseen in a way subject to law.  And it\\'s the private sector, if anything, which is emerging as the \"they\" in your scary scenario.', 'Thank you, John, and thank you, David and Michael, for an excellent discussion and debate.  I hope the audience understands that neither Stewart nor I are in favor of an unfettered, unchecked executive authority to commit domestic spying.  Thats not what were arguing here. We understand that this is an incredibly difficult area of governance and requires tough oversight, the involvement of Congress, and the involvement of the judiciary.  So please understand thats where were coming from.  There is another side to this, aside from the legitimate interest in personal privacy that we all have, and its security.  And this is, as I said in my opening, not abstract, and Ill end with a brief anecdote.  I was Deputy Commissioner of Counterterrorism in New York City Police Department.  We were part of the FBI joint terrorism task force.  In September 2008, we learned of a case.  We knew nothing about it until we were told as result of electronic surveillance there was an individual in Denver developing a bomb and intending to transport it back to New York City for the purpose of attacking the New York City subway around, he thought, September 14, 15, or 16.  We found out about that because of his electronic communication with his bomb-making trainer in Pakistan. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - He drove across the country, FBI surveillance team in Denver acquired him and began surveilling  him in the course of his drive across the country with one to two kilograms of TATP  explosive in his trunk. We began an investigation of his contact, who he was in telephonic communication with.  As a result of that, dozens of people he was in communication with were identified.  Quickly, his two key co-conspirators, and then subject to much higher levels of intrusion -- of intrusive investigation.  This was a real plot against the city of New York, where I was at the NYPD, and it was stopped not entirely, but in large measure because of the techniques we were talking about here tonight.  This is not abstract. There is another side to this, and it something which is very, very valuable.']\n",

      "['Well, my high school teachers said the same thing. And so -- [laughter] -- I think you guys have to give me a little break. These guys are all smarter than I am, so there [unintelligible] --', \"My partner in this debate is the very, very distinguished professor, Sandy Levinson, who's just written his own great book.\", 'Thank you. What a great and powerful argument. No wonder he is considered a genius. But let\\'s think about his argument for a minute. The argument was really not so much in favor of the Second Amendment. It was in favor of the right of self-defense. You are Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - right. We all agree. There should be a right of self-defense. So don\\'t you agree with me that it would have been better if the Second Amendment had been written as \"Everybody has the right of self-defense\" -- then we could argue whether or not guns were necessary, what kinds of guns, what kinds of restrictions. You would also then have to debate whether or not guns were permissible for hunting, because hunting is not part of self-defense. The Second Amendment reads rather differently. It starts out by saying \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,\" then the right of the people to bear and keep arms. So, I think everybody would agree that the first clause of the Second Amendment, \"well-regulated militia,\" has outlived its usefulness. We do not have militias, state militias. They are as anachronistic as the Third Amendment, talking about that we can\\'t quarter troops. Now, that doesn\\'t mean that I would want to amend the Bill of Rights. I don\\'t want to amend the Third Amendment. I prefer to leave it there, because if you start amending the Third Amendment, Sandy will have a constitutional convention. And he\\'ll have people who might start amending the First Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. So I\\'m happy to leave all the amendments there, as long as we acknowledge that the Second Amendment, like the Third Amendment, has outlived its usefulness. My point is it would have been so much better if we had established the primary right in the Constitution, the right of self-defense. Then we would have nothing to debate. We would all agree there is a right to self-defense. We would then be able to debate what the derivative right is from the right of self-defense, just like we debate today as to what the derivative right of privacy is from the Fourth Amendment, the right of the people to be secure in their homes and places. But we have to distinguish between the primary right and the secondary right. The primary right should be the right of self-defense. Of course I throw the question to my distinguished opponents: are they conceding that the Second Amendment should be interpreted to abolish the right of hunters to own weapons that are useful only in killing animals and are not useful in defending one\\'s home or oneself? Should one have to demonstrate that one is using the weapon for self-defense? Would you rewrite the Second Amendment, if you had the choice, and abolish the term \"a well- regulated militia,\" and say, instead, \"The right of self-defense, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall be infringed.\" It seems to me, from Professor Volokh\\'s argument, that he would support such an amendment, or at the very least, if he had been a framer of the Constitution, he would Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - have preferred an amendment which started out with the right of self-defense being essential. So I think you\\'ve helped defeat your own argument by creating -- [laughter] -- a new basic fundamental right -- [applause]  -- and then deriving the right that\\'s in the Constitution from that fundamental right. And so, the question remains, what difference would it make? The difference is fundamental. I agree with you.  Basic rights should be recognized by constitutions.  Virtually every country in the world today recognizes the right of self-defense.  Four countries in the world, Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States, I think, recognize the right to bear arms, so the vast majority of countries feel and believe that you can have a right of self-defense without necessarily having a fundamental right to bear arms.  It seems to me that that\\'s a relevant consideration, and I agree with my distinguished colleague that the lavatories of democracy should be allowed to operate.  And we should not federalize this constitutional right.  We should not be the only leading industrial country in the world that has as a fundamental right the right to bear arms. What do the four countries that have a right to bear arms have in common?  What does Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States have in common?  They all have extraordinarily high crime rates, extraordinarily high murder rates, extraordinarily high death rates.  I don\\'t want to get into the argument because I agree, all of us would agree here, the statistics cut both ways.  You can make arguments in favor of the fact that guns cause death, other arguments that guns prevent death, but look at the reality in a common sense way.  Look at the fact that we are a country infested with murder and death and gun injuries and suicide and accidents in the home.  It cannot be a coincidence that the easy availability of guns in our country has nothing to do with high murder rates.  That just can\\'t be a coincidence. [applause] Yes there are cultural differences.  To be sure, Japan is not the United States, England is not the United States, but when you look at the crime rates in those countries and do all Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - the comparisons you want, you can compare inner cities in one country with inner cities in another country and I know you can get all kind of data to support your conclusions, but at bottom the question really comes to what kind of society do you want to live in? Do you want to live in a society where we are forced to defend ourselves by guns, where the more the bad guys get guns the more the good guys have to arm and get guns?  Im reminded of the great episode from \"All in the Family\" where Archie Bunker gets to do an op-ed on television.  And he says, \"The way to solve the problem of airplane hijacking is very simple.  Require everybody who gets on an airplane to have a gun.  That way nobody will hijack an airplane.\"  Do you want to get on a plane in which everybody has a gun? And do you want to live in an America where everyone has a gun?  If the answer to that question is no, let\\'s acknowledge that the 2nd Amendment is anachronistic, has outlived its usefulness.  Let\\'s not abolish or amend the 2nd Amendment, let\\'s construe it reasonably to permit gun control, to limit the ownership of guns to the right of self- defense, perhaps -- here I\\'m going to go further than you, perhaps also allow hunters to have limited access to guns.  That\\'s my position.  Thank you. [applause]', 'Not at all.  I think the Second Amendment historically gives the right of the people the right to use guns against their government.  As Jefferson said over and over again, we need to have armed citizens in the state to make sure that there are no monarchies trying to take over.  It was a right of revolution.  There was no debate, as far as I know, about self-defense.  It may have been implicit, but the Second Amendment\\'s language and many of the people who are the strongest supporters of the Second Amendment are literalists. They go to the original understanding.  They look at the words -- why are you prepared to excise the first, whatever it is -- 10 words from the Constitution? \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state\" -- are you prepared to concede that a well-regulated militia is no longer necessary to the security of a free state? Male Speaker: Uh, no.', 'So, what does \"well-regulated\" mean? What you\\'re trying to do is now say that everybody who owns an individual gun has to be a part of a regulated militia. They have to come to the green every day and march and --', '[inaudible] --', \"But we don't have a well-regulated militia now. We don't have any kind of militia now.

I'm not denying that the right to bear arms might have some current relevance as part of a right of self-defense.  What I am arguing is that prelude to the operative words of the amendment clearly have become obsolete, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security.  Now, the answer that David gives is you want the Deacons of Justice to be able to come and have an armed conflict with the Ku Klux Klan.  Now I was in the south during the Civil Rights Movement.  The last thing Martin Luther King wanted was to arm the people and the civil rights workers.  He wanted to confront violence with peace, and a well-regulated militia would've included the Ku Klux Klan.  They were the citizens.  They were the ones who were worried about the government taking away their civil right to have a segregated community.  And the answer that my opponents give is if the Ku Klux Klan is armed, then we ought to arm civil rights workers, and let's have a war.  I think Martin Luther King gets the better of that argument.

We ought to constitutionalize the right of self-defense, but not the derivative right of gun ownership.\", 'They lose.', 'This is just the beginning.', '10 years --', 'I ask you to vote for the motion based largely on what Professor Volokh has brilliantly argued. He has conceded that he wouldnt include a militia in his model Bill of Rights. He also has conceded that he wouldnt constitutionalize the right of hunting. By making those two arguments, he has conceded the basic proposition: that the Second Intelligence Squared U.S. - 58 - Amendment the way its currently written is anachronistic and has outlived its usefulness. He would substitute another amendment for that, an amendment much like the one that he said was passed in Wisconsin. It seems to me that they have conceded away the basic argument, namely that the Second Amendment as written is anachronistic. Whats left? Whats left is: do we really want militia groups that are armed today, and armed under the Second Amendment, to have the right to confront our government and try to conduct yet another revolution of the kind that we had back in the American Revolution and the Civil War? It seems to me the answer to that is quite clearly no. Sigmund Freud had a very famous statement back 100 years ago in which he said, The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization. The First Amendment protects insults. It does not protect stones, it does not protect violence. We could live very comfortably with a First Amendment and without a Second Amendment. I dont want to amend the Bill of Rights because I worry that other things could happen, but I do want to make it very clear that the Second Amendment with its emphasis on militias and hunting, and with no mention of self-defense has outlived its usefulness. Therefore I urge you to vote yes and lets begin a debate on whether we should have an amendment protecting the right of self-defense, not the right of guns. [applause]']\n",
      "['Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - Well, if I get an obituary in the New York Times, when the time comes, no doubt that article will be the lead.', \"Thank you.  I want to begin by repeating a point that Bob Rosenkranz made.  This is not a debate about policy.  As it happens, I can't completely speak for my colleague, Professor Dershowitz, but I would very much oppose, for example, a federal law banning guns independent of the Second Amendment, because it is very, very clear that there is a critical mass of Americans who would be vehemently opposed to that.  It would just add to the divisions in the country and it would increase the number of criminals in the country, because just as with drug laws and gambling laws and the like, there is no reason to believe that such a law could generally be enforced.  Most enforcement requires a willingness to comply with a law that one regards as relatively legitimate, and this law would not be regarded, I think, in that capacity. It's also true with regard to a number of other gun control statutes that are proposed that I have distinctly mixed feelings about, many of them on a variety of policy grounds, but fortunately we're not here to debate that.  Nor do I think we are here to debate the one true meaning of the Second Amendment, as interesting as that topic is, and about which indeed I have written.  Rather, I want to emphasize the topic that is in front of us, The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived Its Usefulness.  Now, one reason I relish this statement of the question is that I'm one of those relatively rare people, I will admit, who actually believe there should be a new constitutional convention, because I believe that a number of provisions of the constitution have outlived their usefulness. I wouldn't even say that the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms is the one the kinds of considerations that led to the placement of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights, which Bob Rosenkranz summarized, I think, very well, have outlived their usefulness.  So, if we were going to have a debate in 2013 about what substantive Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - rights, as well as what structures the Senate, bicameralism, presidential veto and stuff like that, what would a 2013 or 2015 constitution look like?  Would it include a substantive right in the United States constitution to bear arms? And I would argue that the answer is no.  Let me also emphasize that this is a different question from whether state constitutions should include a right to bear arms.  Eugene has written one of the definitive articles showing, I don't know what the current number is, but I think it's over 40, state constitutions do protect a right to bear arms, and that raises a very, very important question of whether we need to have that in the United States constitution as well.  Let me give you two principle reasons why a constitutionalized right to bear arms instead of a right to bear arms that would simply be fought out in the political process, and all of us know that the political process today is tilted either legitimately or illegitimately, that's the topic of yet another debate that we need not have this evening, generally in favor of the rights of gun owners. So, let me give you the two reasons why I think the Second Amendment has outlived its usefulness in the 21st century. The first reason is precisely that it is anti-federal. That is to say, one of the anomalies -- sometimes very difficult to tell the players without a scorecard -- in the debate about gun rights. There are many people who define themselves as conservatives who rail against a rampaging national government that believes in one-size-fits-all solutions to national problems. Well, this is not necessarily what Heller decides, but it is what the Supreme Court decided two years later in the McDonald case, where it held that every state in the union has to toe a single line. Louis Brandeis spoke very eloquently of states as little laboratories of experimentation. Most states have chosen to experiment in favor of gun rights. There are some states -- or cities -- very dense cities, like Washington, D.C., that would prefer different experiments. Or in New York itself, one can well imagine a particular policy for the great cities of New York and a very different policy for upstate New York, where there are far, far more hunters than is the case in Manhattan, say. And one of the things that a single national constitutional amendment -- as interpreted by the Supreme Court -- does is to stifle that kind of federalism. And I think that's a mistake. But there's a second real problem with constitutionalizing the right to bear arms in the 21st century. As Mr. Rosenkranz suggested, the right to bear arms -- or the Second Amendment -- had a kind of cosmetic value until 2008. It's not that people didn't write Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - about it. I wrote about it. Eugene wrote about it. A number of people found it very interesting. But it played remarkably little role in actual American law. Beginning with Heller, it does play a role. But what does that mean? It means that you turn over decision-making power to a group of federal judges who are highly divided, who have no expertise in this area, and who make often quite remarkable -- even unreasoned -- distinctions. Thus, for example, in Heller, Justice Scalia says that Dick Heller is protected, which I think is a perfectly plausible argument, but he suggests that Martha Stewart is not, because she actually lied to an FBI agent and is thus a convicted felon. I don't think judges should be making those kinds of decisions. I think legislators should.\", \"I would certainly consider it. It makes a lot of sense. But quite obviously, as I suggested in my opening remarks, it's a very, very capacious right. Does it extend to Martha Stewart, a convicted felon? And to me, it seems the answer should be yes. If Martha Stewart had knocked over a bank with a gun, I'm not sure that I would say she preserves her constitutional right to self-defense. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 - What about non-U.S. Nationals who live in the United States? You know, do they not bleed? Do they not have lives that are threatened? And then what about illegal aliens? The Fifth Circuit, as I'm sure Eugene and David both know, split 2-1 on whether or not a federal law that prohibits illegal aliens from possessing guns is constitutional. Their argument was that the point of the original Second Amendment -- and I think they're correct. I didn't do adequate justice to Bob Rosenkranz's initial introduction -- I think the historical origins of the Second Amendment really do have to do with citizen militias and organizing to overthrow corrupt governments. And the argument was that an illegal alien isn't part of the American community politically, which is certainly true. That doesn't mean that an illegal alien has no right to self-defense.\", \"But that wasn't put in the U.S. constitution.  They knew about that and they didn't put it in.\", 'Okay.  Ninety percent of the American public, rightly or wrongly, but 90 percent of the American public thought that the Senate should at least take a vote on enhancing background checks.  It never got to the floor of the Senate.  Last night I think the NRA invited people before the debate to chime in with their views, and I was told before we came out that the current vote is something like 43,000 against the motion and --', 'Yes.', 'Right.  And -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 -', 'The strongest argument for substantive constitutional rights is when you believe that a vulnerable minority is likely to be victimized by what Americans learned to call \"the tyranny of the majority.\" Whatever your views are on gun control, at least right now -- and throughout most of American history -- it is so wildly unlikely that the -- however many people own the 300 million guns -- because most people who own guns, I think, own multiple guns -- that they are comparable to Jehovahs Witnesses, say, or some other vulnerable minority that they need the special concern of judges, basically, to make up public policy for the entire country.', \"All right. I'm just a Texan. [laughter] I think we ought to be aware that there's something strange. Again, what everyone's views are about gun rights in the United States -- there's something strange in referring to them as a human right, because -- and here's, I think, where Alan's point comes home -- it really is quite remarkable that among the roughly 190 countries or so that are currently in the U.N., there are a grand total of four that recognize some kind of constitutionalized right to bear arms. And you discover that the Mexican constitution allows reasonable regulation. So, it may be -- I mean, this is -- again, topic for a different sort of conversation -- it may be that there is something about American culture that recognizes that it is a right within the United States. It's part of American exceptionalism that guns are treated much more seriously than anywhere else in the world, but human rights arguments really do have a universalistic overtone.  We talk about intervening in foreign countries because they don't recognize human rights.  So does David suggest that we invade --\", '-- one or another of the 108 countries --', \"No.  I'm talking about -- no.  I'm not making that argument.  I'm simply talking about nomenclature that it's one thing to say we in America are committed to certain rights, some of which look very, very odd to the rest of the world.  We could talk about hate speech in this context, and you and I both agree that hate speech is protected by the 1st Amendment. Most countries around the world don't protect hate speech, and they're decent liberal countries who simply have a different understanding of what free speech means.  All I'm saying is that an argument based on the particularities of American culture is very different from an argument based on human rights.\", 'You know, I agree with that.', \"Most Americans, if you poll them, believe a) that there is some kind of fundamental individual right to own firearms, and b) that there ought to be reasonable regulation. So, the question is who ought to decide at the end of the day what counts as reasonable regulation?  I believe precisely because there's so much difference -- good faith difference of opinion, that this is an America of the 21st Century, a subject for legislative resolution.  You won't like some of the particular solutions, but that's what federalism and political diversity is about.  But none of us on this panel is arguing that the state can never ever limit guns, and at least as a political preference, neither Alan nor I would support in the United States in the 21st Century a proposal to ban any and all firearms, but we're talking about reasonable regulation and who ought to make reasonable regulation.\", 'Well, but there\\'s a tension here, because -- I mean, for the first 200 years of our history, the Second Amendment really played no role in American constitutional law, if you define that as judicial decisions, especially at the national level. It\\'s only been in the last six, seven years that it\\'s played any role. So, the debate, in part, as well, should the Second Amendment now really be invigorated so that five to four majorities of the Supreme Court will decide whether or not Martha Stewart should be able to have a gun Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 - for self-defense? And it appears, although Justice Scalia didn\\'t offer even an iota of a reason -- that he said, \"No, she doesn\\'t get it.\" Or do you want these -- let\\'s say, hashed out? Either the Second Amendment really has some genuine bite to it or it\\'s an expressive aspect of the Constitution --', '-- as it has -- as it was for roughly for the first 200 years of our history.', \"I think we're dancing around the fact that --\", '-- there are at least thousands, and maybe even a couple of million Americans who believe we do live in a tyranny, who are organized in militia movements. And all of the focus on self-defense and the idea that the Second Amendment -- the original Second Amendment is historically anachronistic, with regard to \"Oh, everybody believes the current United States is just wonderful,\" there are some people -- I don\\'t agree with them, in terms of their own politics, but there are some people who don\\'t think it\\'s wonderful and who want to drill and know how to use arms against the possibility of engaging in armed revolt. Now, do you support that as a protected Second Amendment right? That should be constitutional?', 'Militias. Eugene Voloh: I think probably would be -- I mean, if it initially --', 'No. Just to drill.', \"You know, I think there's a deceptively easy answer --\", '-- to your question. The 1787 Constitution did not include the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment, as Alan would emphasize, is part of the Bill of Rights that were added in 1791 at the behest of people who really were very suspicious of this new national government that was created by the Constitution. And, you know, one could quote Emerson or Walt Whitman, that the Constitution contains contradictions. And you have put your finger on a very key contradiction --', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 - Two quick things. I like state constitutions and their ability to experiment. One of the things I like about state constitutions is that with almost no exception, they're all easier to amend than the U.S. Constitution. So, if the good people of Wisconsin should decide in the next 10 years that maybe this is too broad, then it's really very easy to amend the constitution. One of the problems with the United States Constitution is that it's next to impossible to amend, so that we are stuck with the language of 1787 or 1791, which you're happy to jettison. But which does involve, in fact, re-writing the history of the Second Amendment and re-writing what many people thought was the original meaning of the Second Amendment.\", \"I think it's a legitimate question.  That is to say --\", \"Justice Scalia, without presenting any argument, announced in Heller that just as Martha Stewart can be deprived of her right to self-defense, it apparently was the case that all laws limiting the rights of mentally ill people, a notoriously accordion-like term, could be limited. I presume that all of us agree there are some mentally ill people who shouldn't be allowed close to a gun.  I would imagine that as a policy matter, not as a constitutional matter, all of us might well agree that there are some mentally ill people whom we would, in fact, allow to have a gun if we really do take self-defense very seriously.  This -- what you might want is legislators, city councils, et cetera, to write very careful legislation and tell us which is which, rather than to leave this up to judges who, quite frankly, have no training whatsoever in discerning differences of level of mental illness, or have no training in trying to figure out what, if anything, the data actually support.\", 'All right. It\\'s no surprise that my friend Eugene Volokh makes very, very powerful, eloquent arguments about the public policy of gun control. But that\\'s not what we\\'re debating this evening. The question is to what extent any particular policy should be constitutionalized, which at the national level, means that it\\'s close to written in stone and impervious to any change in the future. And I really do think when you vote, that ought to be the principal question you\\'re asking, not whether you believe a particular policy in 2013 makes sense, because if you constitutionalize it, you also have to say, \"It\\'s going to make sense in 2023, 2033, and ad infinitum.\" Secondly, I think David Kopel used interestingly different language at different points in his argument. And he, too, has made very capable arguments. I don\\'t know him so well as I know Eugene, so you shouldn\\'t take anything amiss when I don\\'t refer to him as my friend. I\\'ve known Eugene, you know -- -- since he was a child, almost. But -- [laughter] Male Speaker: He was very bright. Sanford Levinson: -- at one point, David said that -- I think it was Washington\\'s policy -- no rational person could agree with it.', \"Oh, okay. New York-- it really doesn't matter. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 56 -\", 'Now, I really --', \"-- don't think it's the case that you have to be a lunatic to agree with Michael Bloomberg. Maybe he's got the wrong policy. But it seems to me that the rationality test -- at least the way that lawyers use it -- really does require that you believe the other side is truly lunatic. But what was telling is that in his more recent comment, he said, in effect, that there are legitimate reasons for -- there are reasonable people who disagree.

      "[\"Probably a slight advantage.  Economists are definitely much more pro-immigration than most Americans, but economists also don't like to be extreme.  I'm an exception. [laughter]\", 'Vivek Wadhwa, god of Twitter.', 'Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere.  Given current policy, it does sound radical.  But notice, the resolution does not say \"Let Anyone Become a Citizen Anywhere.  The resolution does not say \"Let Anyone Collect Government Benefits Anywhere.  The respondent does not say \"Let Anyone Vote Anywhere.  The resolution only says that no matter where you\\'re born, it should be legal for you to accept a job offer from a willing employer. The resolution parallels -- let any woman take a job anywhere, or let any Jew take a job anywhere, or let any black take a job anywhere.  The resolution is not a request for charity and it is not a demand for government help.  It simply asks the world\\'s Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - governments to stop requiring discrimination against foreign workers.  But most [unintelligible] arguments focus on high-skilled, high-tech workers.  I outsourced this topic to my partner, Vivek Wadhwa.  I\\'m going to focus on the vast majority of would-be immigrations who aren\\'t high-skilled or high-tech.  Haitian shoe shines.  Nigerian waiters.  Mexican gardeners.  Bangladeshi farmers.  Now, why on earth shouldn\\'t we require discrimination against such people? Who would want them? You know, the same reason that we shouldn\\'t require discrimination against women, against Jews, or against blacks.  They\\'re fellow human beings. And they count.  Now, suppose the world\\'s governments made it illegal for Ron  to work anywhere but Haiti.  Would that be morally acceptable, to trap Ron in Haiti for the rest of his life? Mandatory discrimination against foreigners is especially awful, because most of the world\\'s workers earn vastly more in the first world than they ever could at home.  Moving from Haiti to Miami increases your wages by about 20 times.  That is not plus 20 percent.  That is not plus 200 percent.  That is plus 2,000 percent.  Now, you could object that we\\'re not obliged to help total strangers.  You know, you\\'ll say -- but the important point is, remember, allowing someone to take a job is not charity.  Let me repeat that.  Allowing someone to take a job is not charity.  What is it? It\\'s call minimal decency.  So, suppose that Kathleen were to get a job.  If I refrain from slashing her car tires on her first day of work, that does not make me a philanthropist.  I am not starting the \"Save Kathleen Newland Fund\" when I don\\'t vandalize her car. I\\'m merely leaving Kathleen alone.  Now, sometimes tragically, just leaving someone alone has enormous costs.  For example, if someone has bubonic plague, a quarantine really is the lesser evil.  If you leave the person with bubonic plague free to roam, he could kill millions of people.  Would open borders wreck comparable harm on our economy? No.  Every scholarly estimate of the economic effects of open borders finds enormous overall benefits.  Economist Michael Clemens, the world\\'s expert on this topic, finds that a free global labor market would roughly double global production. Now, this point he makes -- double, how is it possible to double global production? Well, consider this thought experiment.  Imagine there were a billion farmers stuck in Antarctica farming the snow.  All right.  I don\\'t know a lot about farming, but it sounds tough.  All right.  Now, suppose we were to let these billion farmers move from Antarctica to anywhere else.  Anywhere with decent soil, decent weather, decent conditions. Well, obviously, the billion Antarcticans would be way better off when they get to leave Antarctica.  But they are hardly the only beneficiaries.  The other beneficiaries of Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - allowing them to leave Antarctica are everyone on earth who eats food, everyone on the -- everyone on earth who eats food benefits from that greater availability of food. Now, economically speaking, Haiti and Bangladesh really are like Antarctica.  They\\'re countries where workers realize only a small sliver of their full potential.  Ask yourself this:  What is the best job that you could get in Bangladesh?  Not very good.  Now, wouldn\\'t open borders hurt American workers?  Some.  Take me.  I am a native born college professor.  Thanks to a massive immigration loophole, virtually any PhD in the world can legally compete with me in the U.S. labor market.  As a result, about half of all U.S. research professors are foreign born.  This has slashed my wages and my career prospects.  Right now, there is probably an immigrant sitting at Harvard in the office that is supposed to be mine. [laughter] Bryan Caplan: Now, is my sad, sad story a good argument for immigration restrictions?  Sure, it\\'s a great argument.  Wait.  No, it\\'s a terrible argument. [laughter] Professorial immigration is bad for me, but it\\'s good for consumers of education.  If you\\'re glad that you didn\\'t pay even more for your college education, thank an immigrant.  The same goes for every occupation.  Immigration of waiters is bad for native born waiters, but it\\'s good for diners.  Immigration of gardeners is bad for native born gardeners, but it\\'s good for homeowners.  So how on earth could we ever judge the overall effect?  There is a very simple answer.  Keep both eyes firmly on production. Keep both eyes firmly on production.  When global production doubles, your standard of living is very likely to rise.  This is not trickle-down economics.  It is Niagara Falls economics. Now, what about the endless, noneconomic complaints about immigration?  I\\'m sure we\\'ll get into an enormous number as we go on.  So I will just give you a general rule for how I respond to all of them.  Here is the rule:  For any complaint you have, there is a cheaper and more human main remedy than mandatory discrimination against foreigners.  Immigrants have used the welfare state.  Let them work, but not collect benefits.  Immigrants damage the environment.  Let them work but tax their pollution. Immigrants vote the wrong way, let them work but not vote.  Immigrants hurt well- skilled Americans.  Let them work but charge immigrants an admission fee or a surtax. Then use those funds to compensate native workers who lose out.  If you think these Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - remedies are unfair, they are certainly less unfair than turning honest workers into criminals just because they were born in the wrong country. [applause] Bryan Caplan: To conclude, let -- [laughter] Bryan Caplan: Let anyone take a job anywhere.  It is the right way to treat your fellow human beings. It will transform the world for the better, and it will cost us less than nothing.  Thank you. [applause]', \"I'm just trying to imagine Kathleen going to Haiti and telling them, look, we need to keep you out because if we let you in, we'd have to give you free healthcare, and I don't feel like doing that.  So you have to stay here.  And that way we can maintain our standard of living.  It just seems like, to anyone that was not already inside of your in group, this argument would be totally unconvincing because it would be so obvious that you really just don't care about them, and you're willing to do almost anything to people outside of your group.  Let me put it this way:  When parents are judging a sporting event, they take extra effort to not show favoritism to their kids.  Why?  Because favoritism is in their hearts.  What I'm saying is we need to be equally careful to not show favoritism of this kind to our fellow citizens.  We need to make sure that we are treating people from other countries fairly.  And this is not what you are doing.\", \"No.  So here's the important thing.  While it's true -- [laughter]\", 'Absolutely.', \"So if there are really only one kind of labor, then Ron's theory is right, you let in a ton of people and wages go down.  However, Ron didn't get to the empirical part of economics, which is a really important part.  Here's the thing, there are many different kinds of labor.  There are high skilled labor, mid-skilled labor, low skilled labor; you can go and read the most respected critic of immigration in the entire economics profession, George Borjas, and all that he'll tell you is that immigration has been bad for high school dropouts.  Everyone else, he says there have been gains.  So when you consider the effect of immigration, it's not going to be in effect upon all workers, it's going to be effect upon these narrow segments of workers who I said you could take care of them by having taxes or admission fees for low skilled workers --\", 'Yes. [talking simultaneously]', \"Ron's minimum wage idea is terrible, and Ron could tell you why.  The whole point of Ron's minimum wage proposal is to keep out low skilled workers.  He says it explicitly.  I encourage you to read his piece.  His goal is to make sure that anyone who is not worth $12 an hour, namely, most of the people on earth, are locked in their countries where they're earning a dollar a day.  I think it'd be far better if they could come here and earn -- [talking simultaneously] [laughter]\", \"Ron mentioned the declining -- or the stagnant wages over the last 40 years and suggested that immigrant labor supply was the problem.  There was a much larger change in labor market over the last 40 years.  It's called women entering labor markets. My question for Ron -- so do you think that women entering the labor market was a bad thing for the economy? Was it bad -- did all the gains go to capital? Was it bad for men? I'd like to know.\", 'Yes, very complicated.', \"Any movement towards more open immigration is good for me.  But I will say the most gains come from immigration from poor countries.  Those are where the gaps and earnings are largest.  Those are the people whose productivity is only a tiny fraction of what they could accomplish if you'd just let them go to another country.  Letting an engineer move from one country to another gives you a small gain in production. Letting an unskilled worker move gives you an enormous increase, because they're stuck in countries where they really just can't use their skills in more than a trivial way.\", 'I would agree.  I would actually -- I would take any partner.  I will dance with anyone, any country that -- any country that we want to open our borders to, I would open our borders to, absolutely.', 'And the reason --', \"-- why that's possible is precisely that it is not legal for them to go under most circumstances.\", \"Under most circumstances, most -- there are very few jobs in Sweden where someone would want to hire someone from another country if they're low skilled precisely because the regulations are so strict.  Again, remember, the whole point of Ron's proposal is to price out most people on earth from the U.S. labor market. He says this.  So when you talk about the poor conditions of workers of other countries. Remember, Ron's proposal is designed to keep them poor at home.\", 'Well, not really. [laughter]', \"That's right.\", 'Even though they are living in total misery back home, and they would be earning five to 10 times as much as they came here.', 'No, it is not.  So if you want to get an idea --', \"Well -- [laughter] Bryan Caplan: So since we're in New York, let's talk about one of the greatest open borders experiments in history, Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico started out as a third world country. When the United States beat Spain.  There was open borders.  What has happened? Well, first of all, about half of Puerto Rico left over the course of a hundred years. Secondly, Puerto Rico is now one of the richest countries in the world.  What happened? People in Puerto Rico, who otherwise would have been stuck in a third world country, not able to use their skills, many of them left and found that there was a better place for them to work.  And those remaining found that their wages were higher.  A lot of what happened was that Puerto Ricans went home and turned a third world country into a first world country.  There's no reason that America cannot do for the world what it did for Puerto Rico.\", 'For the world.', 'Give me -- give me a century, and I will give you prosperity over the surface of the earth.', 'Yes.  So the problem is that Ron keeps talking about labor like there\\'s only one kind of labor.  So everyone in America is identical to everyone else on earth, so you could be replaced in whatever job you\\'re doing by anyone on earth, but that, of course, is not true.  There are many different kinds of labor.  Rich countries send out much more skilled workers.  So you should expect that skilled workers would be among the beneficiaries of the increase in the supply of lower skilled workers.  Now, does this mean that every American will gain?  That is much less clear.  That\\'s where I said if it\\'s only a minority of Americans who are losing, then it is very feasible to say, \"We will charge you an admission fee or a surtax and give you some compensation.\"  But what Ron is talking about is keeping out almost everyone on earth and losing all these benefits that we could otherwise have and, of course, trapping most of the world in poverty for no reason.', 'Why not?', 'There is --', '-- an easy solution to nation poverty, and that is, let Haitians in, right now.', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 - It\\'s a very strong question.  So I ask you imagine going to Haiti and saying, \"Look, we know that you would love to come here and get a job.  We know that there\\'s plenty of people who want to employ you, but unfortunately, if you came, we would feel obliged to give you some other free stuff.  And we don\\'t want to give you any free stuff, so you have to stay in Haiti earning $1 a day.  That is the kind of humanitarianism that America has right now.  I think that is a very poor kind of humanitarianism.  The Haitians would much prefer someone who would say, \"I would -- I\\'m willing to let you come in and get a job.  I\\'m not going to give you free stuff, but I\\'m not going to keep you away, because I don\\'t want to look at poverty.  And that is really what our current system does.  It creates an enormous amount of poverty and then it keeps it away from us so we don\\'t have to look at it.  Open borders is an incredible solution to poverty, but it is true.  You have to look at poor people, if they were to come in.  That is the price we pay for actually gravely producing the problem.', 'And Kathleen -- [applause]', \"So, Kathleen, you seem like a very nice person.  You've been to Calcutta.\", \"You know how horrible things there are.  I find it very strange to say that it's so important that we not have to look at you, that we're going to keep you living here in horrible poverty because you might come to America and earn minimum wage.  It seems crazy to me.\", \"Sure.  So first thing when you think about brain drain is, when people complain about it, they really are asking us to do to the people in the third world what the Soviet Union did to its own citizens. It's a scary thought.  However, you could say, well, it was very good for the Soviet Union to keep their smart people in.  At least they didn't get to run away.  [laughs] But I would say, you know, more important -- the more fundamental plight is that the -- letting smart people go to other countries actually creates benefits for not only themselves, not only the world economy, but for people back home.  So Kathleen mentioned remittances.  And if you just want to get an idea about how it works, take a look at Puerto Rico; started out as a third world country.\", 'The migration policy --', '-- of the European Union has been fantastic.  My only complaint is that they keep out most poor countries.', 'As Vivek said, it is hard to believe that we\\'re actually even debating \"let anyone take a job anywhere.\"  If our opponents had told you that the laws prevent women from working, or the laws prevent Jews from working, or the laws prevent blacks from working, you wouldn\\'t just disagree.  You would be appalled.  You would be horrified to hear such words coming out of their mouth.  You should be equally appalled when someone says the laws prevent foreigners from working.  Criminalizing the employment of women, Jews, blacks or foreigners is doubly evil.  It denies workers\\' basic human rights.  And it deprives the world of the full benefit of workers\\' talent and ambition. Open borders should be a bipartisan and bi-ideological cause.  Conservatives should oppose immigration restrictions in the name of freedom, free markets, small government, the work ethic, meritocracy and to Horatio Alger himself. Liberals should oppose immigration restrictions in the name of equality.  Reducing poverty, equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, social justice and the global 99 percent. When the government forbids American farmers to hire Mexican farmworkers, how can a conservative not see the oppressive hand of big government crushing the entrepreneurial spirit?  When the government forbids American restaurants to hire Haitian dishwashers, how can a liberal not see a heartless legal system, diabolically promoting poverty and discrimination?  Please, let anyone take a job anywhere.  It is the right way to treat your fellow human beings.  It will transform the world for the better, and it will cost us less than nothing.']\n",

The Ron that I\\'ve read about is not one of these Tea Party anti-immigrant people who goes around creating fear about the billions who are going to invade America and take away our jobs and so on.  Those are the debates that are happening in Washington, D.C. by a small segment of Congress, which has been elected through a gerrymandered electorate.  That is not the real world.  That is not how Americans think. The fear we\\'ve had about Mexicans coming in and taking our jobs away, they\\'re -- and then Indians coming in and taking our jobs away, they\\'ve not been founded. Now, Bryan explained what\\'s happening in the unskilled sector.  I\\'ve been researching systematically what\\'s happening in the skilled sector, because you have the same fear mongering happening in skilled immigration, that, \"My God, these Indians, they\\'re going to come and take our jobs away.  If we expanded [unintelligible] which one be [unintelligible] the American workers, we all be unemployed.\"  The exact opposite is happening.  America is the most competitive land in the world.  We have reinvented ourselves over and over again.  Diversity rules over here.  Look at New York City.  It is diverse as could possibly be.  The economy is thriving.  People are doing much better. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - Look at the benefits we\\'ve seen from technology, all of the advances that Ron talked about, our iPhones, our Googles.  The fact is the world is connected right now.  We have more knowledge than we\\'ve ever had.  Knowledge has become free.  It used to be that if you needed to get information about your health you had to go to your doctor.  That\\'s it.  Now you just Google and download apps and you have medical information readily at your fingertips.  That happened because of technology.  And you know who\\'s been building these technologies? Immigrants, 52 percent of the startups in Silicon Valley during the most innovative period in recent economic history were founded by immigrants, people like me, people like this audience, people who came here because they saw opportunity, they were highly educated, and they decided to bring their knowledge and their intelligence with them over here and make America a competitive place.  This is what\\'s made this land what it is.  In every generation there were people like -- I mean this is not Ron.  I mean I could have -- I\\'ve heard his -- actually I\\'ve seen his writing.  This was not -- I don\\'t believe what he just said over here. [laughter] Every generation -- [laughter] -- in every generation there have been people who said that \"If we let these Irish in, if we let these Poles in, if we let these Jews in, if we let these people in our jobs will go away.\"  And guess what happened?  These immigrants made Americans work harder, think smarter, compete, and this became the only innovative economy in the world.  We lead the world because of innovation, because we open our borders, and because we allow people to come in here.  Now, that\\'s one perspective.  The other perspective is that I hate to tell you this but the cat is already out of the bag.  How many of you check email when you go home?  All of you do.  Right?

You know, this is getting a little bit off topic, but the point I wanted to make was that already we are in a borderless economy when it comes to knowledge.  We are in a knowledge economy. Knowledge jobs can be done anywhere.  Boeing has engineers working in four or five different countries at the same time, designing aircraft systems, as do most companies.

You\\'re working together because of what technology has made possible.  We are already in a borderless economy.  I live it.  I have a job at Duke University, yet I live in Silicon Valley. My dean over there allows me to work from anywhere I want to work.  I also work for Stanford.  I also work for Singularity University.  I also have a role at Emory University. I\\'m able to be at many different places because I can go over the Internet and now teach lectures.  I can do research.  I can do the things I needed to do.  One of the things I\\'ve been researching is the role of women in innovation or the lack of women in innovation, the fact that they\\'re left out of the innovation economy.  It\\'s something I feel very passionate about.  I did a research project.  I had a team leader in Washington D.C.  I had other researchers in New York City.  We needed a website; we got it built at Stanford.  And we needed a video.  We got it done in Estonia.  I want to crowd-create a book.  I put the word out there, I\\'m looking for people to help me with social media.  I had 300 women all over the world sign up to be my ambassadors.  I wanted to now crowd-edit the book.  I had 500 women all over the world telling their stories.  I could do within six weeks the research that would have taken me years and years to do by using the power of the Web, by using the power of technology, and by letting people work from anywhere. This is a new world.  And I crowd-created a book on innovation.  This would have been unconceivable even five years ago.  So you talk about the damage that open borders are doing.  I\\'m sorry.  It\\'s happening right now.  The topic we\\'re talking about is let the jobs do anywhere.  No one said, \"Let the migration be anywhere.  No one said that a billion Mexicans have to come to the USA and take our jobs away.  Because  we have the unskilled jobs, which Bryan will talk more about, and we\\'ve got the skilled jobs.  The skilled jobs is what most of us in this room do.  They can be done anywhere, because we\\'re knowledge workers and we\\'re in a knowledge economy.  We\\'re now connected to the Internet.  Anything can be done anywhere.  And it\\'s happening.  Over the last five Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - years, we have not seen a decrease in productivity.  We\\'ve seen an increase in productivity.  I\\'m more capable right now -- I\\'m more connected right now.  I go on Twitter and I tweet, \"I need some information,\" and I have hundreds of people all over the world now doing my research for me and providing me back what I need.  That\\'s the power of connectivity, the Web. That\\'s the world we\\'re in right now.  And we have the free flow of information.  We have open borders right now on the Internet.  That didn\\'t cause our productivity to decrease or our jobs to go away or the catastrophe that, you know, my opponents are saying.  It\\'s caused me to be more productive.  It causes you to be more productive.  It causes you to be smarter.  Your children right now have access to the world knowledge. They just get on their iPads or their iPhones and they\\'re connected to everyone else by social media, by Twitter.  They\\'re able to go into websites.  They\\'re able to gain knowledge from everywhere.  They would hire in New Delhi or get video production done in Estonia, like I did.  This is a new world we live in.  It\\'s all open.  And it\\'s not falling apart.  We\\'re moving up the ramp.  This is the most productive, most innovative period in human history, when the world will come together and start solving problems. There\\'s not going to be a mass migration to America, because as we see, from Mexico, the numbers have actually dropped.  As the economy in Mexico rises, there\\'s less incentive for them to come over here. If they can do knowledge work for us where they are and contribute to our intellect and our knowledge, they will do that.  They don\\'t want to be here.  They love being where they are.  No one is fleeing to America because, you know, they want to.  They do it because they have to.  So, let\\'s uplift the whole world.  Let\\'s make the world a smaller place and everyone wins.  It\\'s a better world.  It\\'s a better economy.  And we solve major problems.', 'You know, the solution is something that Ron --', \"-- advocated, which is having a minimum wage.  He has advocated 12 to 15 dollars. Lets say we did that.  We would now lock out the billions that they're worried about.   Ron...

We do things the American way, and we can now make the world a better place.  We uplift the rest of humanity.  Just like in Europe, you have a levelization happening, and you didn't have a mass migration of people between countries, as Kathleen just said.  So the fact is the model can work.  We just need to have the right regulations in effect. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -\", \"Well, let's start leveling the world.  Why do we have -- why do we tolerate --\", \"On the skills side, it's already happening.\", \"Like I said, the free flow of knowledge is already happening.  The fact is that they -- well, that, you know, I get my tax returns -- I have a tax accountant who really outsources the tax processes to India without telling me.  It's happening.  We have medical transcription happening over there.  We have web development happening over there. So any happening in the world income apart, India uplifted, India became a most strategic part of the United States.  We became more productive.  It was win-win.\", 'So all this fear about the world falling apart has not happened.', 'John, if we had the minimum salaries, there would not be a problem.', \"If the United States -- India can have its own minimum salary.  As long as you have minimum standards for people, you can let them do a job anywhere.  The problem happens when you can have slave labor, cheap labor, when you have Haitian salaries in the United States, then everyone loses.  So keep some decent regulations there.  Keep our social values.  Build a real middle class.  This is the beauty of what Ron has been proposing, that under his scheme, we would have a stronger middle class.  We've lost that middle class because we have a minimum wage, which is less than it has been for, what, two or three decades, whatever the numbers are.\", '[unintelligible].', 'The reason why Ron is arguing about billions of people coming over here is because --', \"-- he's worried that they -- that the salaries will go down to zero.\", \"[unintelligible] everything, you don't have high taxes.

Seeing if we're going to now tell the other -- economies of other counties will rise.  Things will get better in the rest of the world.  There may well be a day when Mexico has a stronger economy than the United States.  Now, imagine flipping it on its head, saying Americans can't take a job in Mexico because they happen to be north, west, or south.  That's the same type of thinking we're doing right now.  Other than trying to uplift anyone and make the world a more equal -- more fair place where everyone is well off, we're talking about restricting ourselves.  We're talking about closing our borders.  God knows, we'll have a thousand billion people coming to America and taking our jobs away, decimating our salary, that's not how it's ever been.  That's not how it will ever be.  And if you create a third world country next door to us, if we keep having these restrictive policies, we'll create problems for ourselves.

And that's when the U.S. developed into the powerhouse Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 - that it is.  Most recently, there has been lots of  problems with the number of visas, all these restrictions.  We now have a reverse brain drain going on.  We have skilled talent leaving the country because we won't give them enough visas.  We have this protectionist sentiment.  Now we have a clogged Congress which can't even keep the government open, let alone do rational immigration reform.  Because why?  Because you have a small segment of American society which believes that if we open the doors, billions will come in.  They'll take our jobs away, and this country will go to the dogs.

That's an extreme situation again.\", 'This is the same [unintelligible] as the Tea Party --', \"Right through American history, we've had these same debates, that foreigners will take American jobs away.  We always blamed foreigners for all the ills.  And now my friend over there is blaming foreigners for the income disparity between the rich and the poor. Immigrants haven't done that.  That's the evil Wall Street that's done that, my friend. That's a different problem in American society.  We can have a balanced immigration policy, which allows people in that makes sense for America, that make it more competitive to come in here.  It's happened with skilled immigration.  Skilled immigration has made America the most fiercely competitive land in the world.  We're seeing benefits from it.  It's uplifting society.  A lot of good has come from skilled immigration.  We're moving into this knowledge economy in which we really tested what happens with open borders.  The fact that we're communicating, connecting with people everywhere.  Our children are now connected to children in the poorest parts of the world because of open borders, which is the internet.  So closing off borders, saying that, no, you can't have people taking a job, you know, where they need to, is like closing off the internet.  It doesn't make sense in this -- in this modern day era.  It's good for America.  It's made what is -- America what it is.  Let's get beyond this protectionism. Let's get beyond this close mindedness and blaming foreigners. There's billions of Mexicans that are going to come in and take our jobs away.  They're going to decimate our standard of living.  False.

      "['Thank you.', \"Right guy, wrong wife.  I married a Marine Corps brat who grew up on Camp Pendleton and wasn't leaving.\", 'The undefeated, untied, and always charming, Stephen Moore.', 'Thank you, John, and I agree with the governor.  Thank you, Bob, for sponsoring Intelligence Squared.  I love the format.  Thanks to the Philanthropy Roundtable for hosting us today and to my colleagues, both the wrong and right -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - [laughter] Its good to have you here, I have both the disadvantage and advantage today, my disadvantage is that Im a talk show host and that means five days a week, three hours a day, 15 segments a day, 75 segments a week I do this.  Six minutes is an extended commercial break, its not a segment. [laughter] My advantage, however, is I have a book coming out on the very last day of this year called The Happiest Life and I have spent the last year immersed in the details of the emerging science of happiness, begun 15 years ago by my colleague Dennis Prager with the book Happiness Is A Serious Problem and now most recently by Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute, in his book the Road to Freedom,  happiness is quantifiable. You can figure out what makes people happy and what makes people happy is more to be found in the red states then the blue states.  Now I present that to you in a way that I think many of you will know or be familiar, because many of you share in common with me a friend, Dr.  Jack Templeton.  Jack likes thought experiments, right?  Youve been in those thought experiments with Jack where you reframe the question.  Heres how Im going to reframe it for you, if your son and daughter approaches you and says Mom, Dad, my company, the government, the military, has come to me and said Im getting moved one more time.  Theyre in their 20s.  And theyre going to drop me into a blue state or a red state, I get to pick blue or red.  I dont get to pick the city, I dont get to pick the state, I dont get to pick rural or urban, I dont get to pick suburban or where in that state, I just get to pick blue or red, what do you think?  Its kind of a Rawlsian construct, right?  You dont know where theyre going to end up just red or blue.  Four reasons to say to him son or daughter, red. Number one, when you get there, youre going to want to buy a house, California is 200 percent above the median cost in the average house in America.  California is below that median.  New York is 150 percent.  Highest mortgage debt is in California, highest mortgage debt is in the District of Columbia.  You want your child to be able to buy a house and begin that American dream, send them to a red state.  Number two, youre going to want them to have kids, right?  You want to be grandparents.  Everybody wants to be a grandparent, I just became a grandparent; its a great thing.  Guess where the fertility is?  Guess where people are actually having families and babies, the top 10 most fertile states are red. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - [laughter] The 10 least fertile states are blue.  I want to read that blue list to you, because it really is blue, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, theyre going to way of Russia and Spain, they will not be there in 10 years because theyre not any children. [laughter] But more importantly -- actually thats just an indication of other things.  Volunteerism is spread out evenly across red and blue states, but not charitable giving.  As you will know nine out of the 10 most charitable states in the union are red. Now of course we got Utah and Idaho and weve got the Mormon tide to drive them that way but the other seven are not.  They are, however--whats that an indication of? Religiosity and not merely checked off religiosity, but genuine confirmation of religious belief.  Red state advantage huge on charitable giving.  Number three though when you get there and you have these kids and you got your grandchildren, theyre going to have to drive around a lot, theyre going to have actual practical things to think about in the course of their lives.  Number one, think about the number of times youve pulled into a gas station, the number of times over the life of your child is making that red, blue state decision, theyre going to pull into a gas station.  Its a good proxy for the practical cost of living, gas prices are phenomenally lower in red states, and there are reasons for that, proximity of refinery, production of the basic materials, bigger in red states.  Red states are energy productive.  When I was talking to Steven beforehand and he said you take the economics and Ill take the social stuff. We didnt really say where energy would fit, I thought maybe he would talk about energy production, but then I began to think its really proxy for the willingness to go and grow with what youve got to make it better and then finally those grandchildren of yours are going to need to be educated.  Whos doing the best?  Now Michael Lind is a very experienced and savvy debater and he will throw statistics at you that will not make sense, thats what they do from that side. [laughter] But you listen very carefully to his statistics about education because he cannot defeat this one from the national education assessment study.  The most underprivileged kids when it comes to education are African Americans and Latinos.  The most important Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - manifestation of educational success is bringing the bottom to the middle.  The most important element of that is math and the most important grade is eight.  That is the turning point where the skill set transfers over into the employment probability and possibility of those children.  In the NEAS, the state that is now number two that has made the most progress over the last decade is Texas for blacks and for Latinos, they have rocketed up. Do you know what state is number 49?  This one.  Why is that?  Its because education, innovation is occurring in the red states.  Why is that?  Because they are not in the death grip of special interests that prevent the exploration of the new and the effective. Thats why if you had to pick where your grandchildren were going to be educated and you could not guarantee that theyre going to a private but they are going to go into a public school.  You would pick a red state.  If you were a grandma or grandpa who wanted to give them the best advantage of an exploding opportunity in the education arena.  Now as I warn you again, Michael will come up and bring up SAT scores or ACT scores, and I will give him that, theyre higher in the blue states.  Youve got some legacy investments in the blue state.  Youve got some wonderful cultural advantages.  You might be thinking I want my grandchild to live in San Francisco.  No you dont get to pick that.  This is Rawlsian.  Theyre just going to go red or blue.  And if you really want to think that through youre going to pick red every single time.  Thank you.', 'No, because trajectory is all that matters here.  Not static snapshots, in fact, the Governor and Michael remind me of Steelers fans, just wait until the 70s, theyre always ready for the 70s to come back. [laughter] And to argue these statistics, youve got to project forward, and were not just doing statistics.  I would point out for the purposes of the debate, Michael conceded the most important statistic which is homeownership, the affordability index for families, he also attempted to make the argument, I wanted to point it out so that the audience contest it that he doesnt really think that matters. Ive never met a young couple for whom the acquisition of their first home did not matter.  Texas is making that happen for people.  The one statistic that Im going to hope Steve responds to, because I actually dont know how to respond to it, that the Governor has on his favor is that venture capital is flowing in.  I believe thats because information workers here are not unionized and they do not have to worry about the right to work, the advantage of the South, so that they go and do Google and the center of gravity will be up there.  On the other hand I think that creates hyper-wealthy super classes, not the sort of people that you want -- that will benefit from ta thriving middle class such as you would find in Texas and the energy states.', \"I want your vote, and I want your vote based on this thought.  When Stephen illustrates, perhaps a little bit over the top with the North Korean explanation, but what he illustrates -- what he's talking about is the inability of California to change its institutions.  They're not doomed.  They are bankrupt.  They are functionally bankrupt. And the inability to change is because there are super majorities in the state legislature and this occurs in New York and in Massachusetts and other doomed blue states to bankruptcy. Doomed to bankruptcy.  Illinois, [unintelligible].\", \"Because they've done deals with public employee unions that cannot be paid for. They've written checks that cannot be paid for, except three generations down the road; there are scores, hundred, thousands of six-figure retirees at the age of 50 in California, governor, and I'm sure you can speak to this.  It wasn't your fault.  You inherited a lot of it, but you've got prison guards walking around at six figures that people have to pay for and the lifespan, and Michael, one quick response, we don't have to worry about those uninsured, right?  Didn't Obamacare fix that? [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 -\", 'They took it out of the system.  They could log on.', 'Sure, Im amused by the idea that we cant count energy, thats like saying engines dont matter to cars.  Theyre there, theyre fixed and they will be there for a very long period of time.  Its like saying California greatest advantage, which is its coast, its extraordinary coast, its harbors, its ability to tap into the Pacific Rim which they have not damaged.  In fact Governor Davis did quite a lot to advance international trade, thats its natural advantage and they use that.  They do not use their energy but I dont think we can penalize states that use their energy resources and Ill also say this, the states which are technically blue but operationally red, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and my home state of Ohio are in fact going to become red over the next 30 to 40 years, which are a time frame that I think were talking about the future, we think of our children, our grandchildren. I think you look out there and you see that they become energy producing states.  Their governors are adopting free market enterprise solutions, and that they will be the future because theyre going red not blue and those under class that you worry about Michael, rightly, are going to have greater opportunities to advance under what Arthur Brooks put forward as earned success but youre saying --', 'Well, because your kid has to actually move my framework, you got to pick a place to live, you got to go.  We dont remove the energy boom that Steven refers to accurately as the most transformative single event in the economy of the last 50 years.  You cant factor it out for the purposes of the debate.', 'Well thats a variable, federal dollars will not be there for much longer unless we want the country to go as bankrupt as California is.', 'If you say absent energy you are creating a world that does not exist.  Everything depends on -- energy is freedom, its everything.', 'First Id ask Adam Myerson, my old friend, about that.  But my guess is that you want -- if you were going to start it you would probably go to a blue state, to an intellectual capital.  I want to be very honest here.  Thats not the proposition before us, but I think you would want to go to one of the great intellectual capitals.  There are some contenders in the red states, but I think probably they are overwhelmingly located in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and New York.', 'If I have it right Live it in a blue state, but before you die move to a red state.', 'Well, I will answer the question with a question, which I will direct to the governor. Governor, is the California Teachers Association a force for the good? [laughter] Are you going to run for a public office again?', 'Oh, it did.  Yes it did.', 'Absolutely it is, the agony of the urban core in California is pronounced.  That agony is everywhere in every urban setting but it is more pronounced in the super cities. Ive spent Thursday morning last with Father Gregory Boyle who has been running Homeboy Industries in south central Los Angeles for 24 years I believe.  Hes buried 183 gang kids over the course of his ministry.  It is a tough, tough place to be poor, it is a wonderful place to be rich.', 'He didnt invent the minimum wage, but the pernicious effects of the minimum wage on the underclass are pronounced.  And that is where its most devastating.', 'Absolutely it matters, and I default to the Catholic middle class in the 50s and 60s that [unintelligible] wrote his wonderful book about.  And how it provided structure, opportunity, and growth for legions of people. And the red states have, as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the greatest amount of volunteerism, the greatest amount of generosity, the greatest amount of those indicators of community that would provide the guard post for the development of a middle class.  Because we all project upon our children their success, our success, but what weve got to really think about is someone whos rising, and where will they be Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - nurtured if they are indeed in the lower class attempting to move to the middle.  And I believe the rest states provide the greatest opportunity.', 'Because they have the greatest number of churches.  The greatest number of volunteers, because they have the greatest civic involvement.  They are not elites dictate to underclasses, they are middle classes prospering together.', 'John, thank you youve been an excellent moderator, very fair and rigorous, and thank you Governor and Michael, great and worthy opponents.  And thanks to Stephen who actually made the case that I think we were done after round one.  I really would like your vote, and I really would because I think it would send a message.  Let me tell you in 1998, the year that Governor Davis was elected, we passed one of our propositions, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 - Prop 10, which put a 50 cent per pack tax on cigarettes.  And then that money goes back to the counties, to the boards that spend it on children 0-5 to improve their health and their readiness to learn.  Ive served on my Orange County prop 10 board for 15 years. The problems are staggering. The amount of dysfunction in the urban core.  The falling behind.  The inability health problems.  The onset of adult diabetes in children under the age of 12 is epidemic. Learning disabilities, autism is skyrocketing.  Heres the difference between red and blue: blue states have sclerosis.  They cannot innovate, they are in the grips of special interests that have vested interests that refuse to allow them to do things that are necessary.  Red states believe in innovation, and Im glad we brought up Scott Walker, who took an enormous amount of heat for attempting to change the basic paradigm of his state.  In order to make these pressing new problems, which are global and transformative, you have to have political systems that will move, and will be nimble and will try and innovate and experiment.  You need freedom.  And the freedom that Im talking about, the freedom that Stephen Moore writes about all the time, the freedom that we all share.  Everyone wants all states to succeed.  Right, Im not against the blue states, Im just trying to simply that if blue states want to succeed they will adopt red state measures and red state flexibility and mostly red state freedom.  Thank you very much.']\n",
      "[\"Well, it's a little unfair question, because on a day like today with the beautiful view of the ocean, how could I not say California?\", 'Thank you, ladies and gentlemen and thank you so much, John, for the opportunity to come to this great event and debate this important topic.  Its wonderful to get out of Washington D.C., which I call Americans only work free drug zone and lately actually it has been a work free drug zone -- [laughter] So let me make a few points about why this is such an important topic and why for a better life you should move to a red state and I would start with one observation, which is that over the last 20 years weve seen in America the biggest shift in wealth in the history of this country.  Weve also seen a massive change in population of where people are living and this has had profound impact in terms of where the growth is in this country and where its not happening, and so if you look over the last 20 years theres been about 30 to 40 million people who have moved addresses, moved from one state to another and over that same time period about two trillion dollars of wealth and income have moved from one state to another on that. This according to Travis Brown who has written a great book about how money walks, and if you look at those statistics and you look at where people are moving to and where people are moving from it is incontrovertible that people are leaving blue states and they are moving to red states.  Now some of this of course is due to things like weather, people are moving away from the north east especially as we become an aging society and are moving to states like Florida, and Georgia, and North Carolina and South Carolina, no question about it weather has a big impact here.  But its happening all over this country.  Not just moving to better weather states.  In fact if you look at the statistics, an amazing statistic about California -- and I agree with Gray Davis, what a wonderful state this is -- how do you screw it up so much? You know how does the state get so screwed up that people have actually started to move out of this wonderful paradise? Over the last five years one million jobs, roughly -- these arent exact numbers, but roughly one million jobs have been lost in California, and over that same time period one million jobs have been gained in the state of Texas. Thats an amazing statistic.  You want to talk about a transfer of wealth and politic power its leaving California, its going to Texas.  Now I would submit to you that people are not leaving places like Los Angeles and San Diego to go to Houston for the weather. Theyre not doing that, right? Theyre moving there because thats where the opportunity is, thats where the jobs are.  Thats where the kind of free enterprise Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - systems flourish.  And by the way just to continue with this Texas-California comparison, because I think well make this a lot throughout the debate because Texas is a prototypical red state, and California is a prototypical blue state, the poverty rate is California is not 40 percent higher than it is in Texas, which is amazing.  People are always bad mouthing Texas, Oh they dont even have plumbing in Texas and so on, the truth is Texas is actually getting very rich, California not so much so. Second point to make that you should all ponder.  We are all living through, right now, what I call the biggest kind of political, cultural, and economic divide in this country perhaps anytime since the civil war.  And what youre seeing -- to put it very simply if you look at the last few elections is that the red states are getting redder, and the blue states are getting bluer.  And there is absolutely no question about it.  If you look at whats happened, for example, in the Southern states every election for the last four or five election cycles they get more and more Republican, for better or worse, and thats also true of the blue states.  I hail from the state of Illinois; I love the Chicago area; I love the State of Illinois.  What has happened in Illinois over the last 25 years is one of the great tragedies of our country.  Illinois has gone to the pits in just about every single area.  It has huge unfunded liabilities.  High unemployment rate, the dingbats in Springfield just raised the income tax rate by 67 percent. One of my favorite kinds of modern politicians Mitch Daniels, a couple years ago when he was governor was asked about what it was like being a neighboring state of Illinois, and just put it so well he said To be a neighboring state of Illinois in Indiana is like living down the street from the Simpsons.  I thought that is a great way to put it.  And so we are seeing incredible dysfunction in these blue states, and its a tragedy by the way.  And then you ask the question Why are people moving from blue states to red states? And I would submit to you the answer is very clear from the evidence why people are moving.  The two biggest factors, according to all the academic and economic research, are number one: if a state is a right to work state, that is that they do not force unions in their state, and allow every worker to have the right to choose whether they want to join a union or not, those states are flourishing.  And one of the fun things about working at the Wall Street journal, we talk to business owners all the time, big and small, from the corporate fortune 100 companies to small entrepreneurial companies, they always tell us when theyre talking about setting up a new plant or a new warehouse the first question they ask about a state where theyre going to locate is is it a right to work state? Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - Because it its not a right to work state its simply, they just take it off the list.  No matter how many other kind of incentive systems they might have to move there, if youre not a right to work state youre just not in the game to get these new enterprises.  By the way people are always talking about America losing its auto industry, and auto jobs. You know Americas not losing its auto jobs, its just the auto jobs arent in states like Ohio and Michigan anymore.  The auto jobs are now in the South, right? And thats partly because of the fact that those are right to work states.  The second factor that matters a whole heck of a lot is whether a state has no income tax, or low income taxes. And we find this to be highly predictable for where people move.  And so for example in this great country of ours there are nine states that have no income tax. States like Texas, states like Florida, states like Tennessee, states like Wyoming, states like Nevada, states like Washington.  Those states over the last 10, 20, 30 years no matter what kind of period you want to look at, have been producing about two to three times a many jobs per year as the nine or 10 states that have --', 'Okay let me just make one more point --', 'No I cant even --', \"If you don't want to live in a place like Detroit --\", '-- get to a red state.', 'Well look, youre hearing a lot of dueling statistics here, but we as economists believe in something called revealed preferences.  This is a core tenant of economics, which is you dont have to ask us, you know, which is a better state to live in?  You dont have to take Hughs word for it or my word for it or Governor Daviss for it, just look at where people are moving. If you were right, people would be moving to the blue states, but they are not and you may be right that you have all these wonderful things in blue states that make them a wonderful place to live, but you know what?  People dont want to live in those states anymore, youre seeing for every one person thats moving to the states that youre defending, four people are moving to the states -- Male Speaker: Steven, how would -- Stephen Moore: So this is just an incontrovertible fact: people are moving there.  Now does -- Gray Davis is right.  California has unbelievable assets, youre exactly right, your university system, you have an incredibly well educated work force.  You have the best weather, beautiful mountains, beautiful beaches, beautiful women, I mean whats not to like about this state? [laughter] But the truth is, you know, its getting screwed up and people have been leaving; businesses have been leaving.  You go to Nevada, you go to places like Reno, I mean Reno is -- you know this Governor, Reno is filled with businesses that used to be in California, you talk to the business owners and it breaks my heart, I had to leave a third generation California business because I cant operate there anymore and I think thats really -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 -', 'I think -- heres my argument, you are exactly right, this a north versus a south phenomenon, and you know whats happening in America today?  We are witnessing the rise again of the South.  There is no question about it, and in fact if you want to go to a place where the future is happening, you dont go to Detroit, you dont go to Albany, you dont go to New York City, you dont go to Los Angeles; you go to places in the South and its very likely that in my opinion in 10 years -- in 10 years time because of the huge growth of no income tax states, the entire South within 10 to 12 years will be a no income tax region.  Now how in the world -- how in the world are the North going to compete against that?', 'Look you have to then defend the schools in the inner cities, right? I mean how do you explain the abysmal schools in Detroit, in Chicago, poverty in New York, in Boston, I mean the inner city -- and this is really I think one of the fundamental flaws of their argument.  If the blue model worked then Detroit wouldnt be bankrupt right? Because there are no republicans in Detroit.  It is a city that for 50 years has been ruled only by liberal Democrats.  And one of the things I had warned you of is that if you want to move to these blue states, you know, one of the things that they have in those blue states that we havent even mentioned yet, is gargantuan unfunded liabilities in their pension.  You want to talk about the legacy cost, look at the legacy cost of these blue states.  So if you were to move from a red state to a blue state, you are basically Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - condemning yourself and your kids to have to pay a huge amount of your taxes just to pay for the cost of the last 20 or 30 years for retired public workers where you get nothing in return for your tax dollars.', 'I absolutely -- I think -- look, the blue states either have to change or die.', 'They are like East Berlin, they are like East Germany, and theyre like --', 'You know what they dont have -- just one quick thing.  What they dont have -- Youre actually right.  There is a lot of entrepreneurial high tech stuff, you know whats disappearing rapidly from California is manufacturing, and thats because -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -', 'Youre losing them by droves.', \"But, Michael, you just said that the middle class people are moving to Texas.  So, if it's so horrible there in Texas with the taxes, why do they move there?  And the answer to that question, by the way is J-O-B-S.  That three-letter word that Joe Biden always talks about.  Jobs are in those states, and that's where --\", 'All right.  I have to address that.', \"First of all, Michael, thank you.  This is the first time in about five years I've had a liberal talk about how great fracking is, because you are absolutely right.  Fracking is changing America overnight.  We tripled our energy resources overnight, because of this incredible American ingenuity.  Now I am not going to let the two of you get away with saying it's just happening in these states -- these red states, because they have energy resources, because guess what, ladies and gentleman?  Guess what state other than Texas has the most energy resources of any other state? Male Speaker: California. Stephen Moore: California.  California does.  California has five billion barrels of oil in the Monterey shale. What is different about Texas than California?  I wrote an editorial about this a few weeks ago.  Texas is proud to be an oil and natural gas state.  California is embarrassed by it.  If that's how you create jobs, why in the world, governor, won't you allow fracking?  Why isn't the state going full speed ahead?  California used to be the second most energy producing state in the country.  It has been surpassed by North Dakota and other states because they choose not to do it.  Texas -- I mean the state of California, to give you a sense of how crazy they are in Sacramento, they actually passed a cap and trade bill, which is basically putting a tax on your own industry.  Now I dont care what your opinion is on global warming, whether you think its going, you know, the greatest apocalypse for the earth, theres nothing California can do to change the global temperature --\", 'Just one quick point about oil and gas --', 'Just a really quick point, Michael, if you take the oil and gas sector out of the U.S. economy over the last five years, guess what? Theres no recovery at all -- Im exaggerating a little bit but about 90 percent of the growth of the U.S. economy is due to the oil and gas sector, and by the way thats under a president who hate fossil fuels.  I mean the ultimate irony of this president is he will have presided over the biggest oil and gas boom in the history of this country.  So how can you take the oil and gas boom out?  I mean one other quick thing, you know, in New York, weve been talking about a lot of California -- in New York, Governor, they did actually pass a ban on fracking.  And you know what, the Marcella shale goes into New York, upstate New York in places like Syracuse and places like Rochester that really need those jobs.  So in Pennsylvania what theyre doing is the drilling down, theyre going horizontally --', '-- underneath New York --', '-- And theyre taking out all their oil and gas and love it --', 'But wait, John thats like absent air, that -- absent -- thats the whole thing is the ability to go get it.', 'Just one really quick point, I dont know about setting up a foundation, but if youre someone with wealth you sure as hell dont want to die in a blue state, or theyre going to take 10 percent of your money.  So die in a red state. [laughter]', \"This is one of my fundamental disagreements -- to Michael and that kind of left-wing thinking.  They think it's worse to have, you know, no job at all at $14 an hour than a lot of jobs at $9 and $10 an hour.  And I just disagree with that.\", \"I think one of the problems with, you know, the effects -- I think California just raised its minimum wage.  There are a number of blue states that are raising their minimum wage.  What they're essentially doing is pricing out of the market low-wage jobs.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 - They're going to have higher unemployment rates and, by the way, when you do that what you do is you take away the lowest rungs of the economic ladder, because we all started -- I don't know about you, Hugh, but my first job was a minimum wage job at $2.60 an hour, but that was maybe one of the most valuable jobs I had.  I just disagree with that philosophy.\", \"There's no such thing as a bad job.\", 'My statistics show this and by the way unfortunately its not just happening now in blue states.  You know we are now in the fifth year of recovery, the most animated feature of this recovery is the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  Exactly the opposite of what the president wanted to have happen.  By the way, I have nothing -- theres nothing at all wrong with people getting rich.  Someday I want to be rich myself, but you know the fact is that this has been a dreadful, dreadful recovery for low income people and thats because we have adopted kind of liberal blue state policies on a national level that have reduced opportunities for those at the bottom.', 'Hold on, I just want to make this quite clear -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 -', 'But the blue states make it worse because they take Obamas policies and then add on to them like when California raised their minimum wage.  When you raise your minimum rage, you hurt your lowest skilled workers, so you make your poorest workers poorer.', \"Well, I guess my response would be is that a trick question?  Look, California has the highest welfare benefits.  It used to.  I don't know the last few years, but for the last 20 years or so California has had the highest welfare benefits and they've had incredibly high dependency on welfare.  We saw in the 1990s one of the great social experiments in this country where states started -- and, by the way, red governors, states like Tommy -- you know, Tommy Thompson and John Engler, they really changed the welfare system, put in place common sense reforms like time limits and work for welfare requirements and getting people back into school, and boy did that work.  And one of the things that's discouraging is a lot of blue states are moving away from those policies and put -- I mean, you've got a lot of blue state politicians who actually think it's a stimulus for the economy to put people on food stamps, and I'm not making this stuff up.  They think it's good for the economy to put more people on food stamps.\", 'Its funny how blue and red hear differently, I heard your question as being in what category of state blue or red will a poor person have a better chance of not -- of becoming not poor and I believe that that is simply a function of where jobs are created and jobs are being created overwhelmingly in red states, and so if you are poor and you dont want to be poor, if you want to embrace earned success which is in the happiness research the most important thing, read Arthurs book The Road To Freedom.', 'One of the great, great -- [applause] Thank you, one of the great, great, things about our country is, we are 50 states, you know, and you can choose where you live based on the policies that you agree with and its a wonderful thing by the way that you can move to California where you may have the policies that Michael and the Governor like or you can move to a red state and choose those.  I would make the case that those are states that believe in kind of more of a free enterprise, free market system, but you can all choose.  Many of you in this room live in blue states, but I would make just a couple of quick points.  Just one statistic to think about, each and every day in America for the last 30 years, 1,000 people every day have been leaving blue states and theyve been moving to red states. And I would submit to you that that is prima facie evidence that more opportunity, the very kind of opportunity you were talking about Governor, the kind of jobs that you were talking about, Hugh, those are being created in red states for one reason or another.  The energy revolution or the fact that they have lower tax rates or less regulation or right to work, I think they all contribute to that so people can choose where they live and one of the things that we need to do in America, by the way, is get rid of a lot of federal policies and let states decide about health care, let states decide about welfare and work roles and so on and let these ideas flourish, but I would submit to you all if you think about Americas future and you really have to ask yourself this question, where is the future going to happen, America?  Is it going to happen in Detroit?  Is it going to happen in New York?  Is it going to happen in Newark?  Is it going to happen in Chicago?  Or is it going to happen in places like Salt Lake, in places like Atlanta, in places like Kansas City, in states -- in places like Austin, and I would submit to you the future is going to happen in the places where the free enterprise system is flourishing.  The free enterprise system is the goose that lays the golden eggs.  Thats where you want to be. [applause]']\n",

      "['Richard Fisher:', 'Simon Johnson:']\n",
      "[\"First, thanks for getting it anatomically correct. [laughter] Of course, I'm a member of a team.  We're just trying to get it right.  We're trying to conduct monetary policy and regulatory policy in order to promote the greatest economic employment growth that possibly can be created without creating inflation. And this is an issue that's dear to our heart.\", 'My partner, Simon Johnson, is not only the former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, he is also a brilliant professor at MIT of entrepreneurialism and has a great British accent. [laughter]', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - Thank you.  Thank you very much.  When Simon Johnson and I speak of breaking up the big banks, we're speaking of less than a dozen banks that are considered, as you mentioned, too big to fail.  Let me just give you a statistic, 0.2 percent of all the banks in the United States of America control 70 percent of the banking assets of the country. One of them mentioned earlier by Bob, JPMorgan, has assets that exceed the total assets of 5,400 community banks in this country.  Our definition of a bank too big to fail is a bank whose bond holders and shareholders and managers and big customers, even their oligarchs, believe themselves exempt from the rules and the consequences that apply to all others.  If they screw up they'll be bailed out by you, the people in this audience, the American taxpayers.  It happened in 2008, 2010.  You know that.  And then a law called Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress to prevent it from ever happening again, and yet today these banks are bigger and the power more concentrated than ever.  They are just as likely, they may even be more likely to take great risks in search of profits protected by the assumption that failure is an unlikely outcome and that taxpayers will once again come to their rescue.  The mechanics to corral them are more politicized than ever. And even worse, Dodd-Frank, the legislation we just referred to, shackled smaller banks with over 13,000 pages of rules and regulations that as of last year we estimated would take 24,180,156 hours every single year to comply with and to implement.  This places the smaller banks that wish to compete with the big banks at a tremendous competitive disadvantage.  They don't have the resources to hire lawyers and handsome, well- heeled, Brooklyn accented lobbyists like Paul Saltzman to work the regulators. [laughter] Under the law, the big banks are now designated as systemically important financial institutions.  The acronym for that is SIFIs.  Now we, at the Dallas Fed and Simon and I would consider the SIFI an acronym for save if failure impending.  And actually when you think about it, SIFI sounds like a communicable disease. [laughter] Something that's transmitted by risky behavior and indeed -- [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - Thank you. [applause] I was waiting for that response.  Indeed it was the TBTF or the SIFIs who were, if not the cause of, they were the spreaders of the economic virus that nearly destroyed our economy in 2008-2010.  That crisis, we estimate at the Dallas Fed, cost the United States over $15 trillion in output, output we have yet to regain.  And if you do your numbers, you'll know that this is $120,000 per every American household.  The SIFIs, the too big to fail, are a dagger pointed directly at the heart of the American economy.  They threaten the well-being of everybody in in audience and everybody listening to this broadcast.  So yes, Simon Johnson and I are advocates for breaking up the big banks that are considered too big to fail.  Our proposal is simple. We suggest that we limit any and all government guarantees to deposit-taking commercial banking operations of these large bank holding companies.  We will let them operate their other businesses, but first prevent them by law from using your deposits and the governed guarantees for the safety of those guarantees from underwriting any of their other businesses. Secondly, require anybody who is counterparty to their other business, which contracts with them on a risk transaction to sign a simple declaration that if this declaration fails -- if this transaction fails, we will never, ever be bailed out by the taxpayers of the United States.  And, C, subject all those businesses to the regulations that such businesses are subject to when they're not protected by the banking laws that we currently have, that these big bank holding companies enjoy.  For example, on derivatives, make sure they're subject to margin requirements, just like individuals are when they borrow money to buy a stock or a bond. And finally, insist on transparency.  As Bob pointed out, there's not much transparency. There's a lot of opaqueness, as it's called.  The CEOs of these businesses know where their risks are.  If you're a sophisticated analyst, there's no way to determine that by looking at their balance sheet.  And I would actually defy our noble opponents to tell me why what I've just suggested is an unworkable solution.  And Mr. Saltzman and others are very fond of pointing out what they consider to be myths.  One is that there is greater banking concentration in Canada than in the United States, greater concentration in France than in the United States.  That's great if you like Gordon Lightfoot, or if you're French. [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - Or they will point out that there are other industries that have a greater concentration, for example computers or telecoms, that's true.  But these are companies that are not shielded from failure like banks are.  They receive no subsidies from the implied guarantees that the government currently provides them, currently provides the bankers to shield them from failure. Winston Churchill once said that in finance everything that is agreeable is unsound, and everything that is sound is disagreeable.  I know that what Simon Johnson and I propose is disagreeable to the highly paid lobbyists and spokesmen of the too big to fail big banks.  But it is the sound thing to do.  The big banks, in summary, have taken what I call the immoral high ground.  Government policy has led them there, and it has enshrined them.  We need to correct this perversion of American capitalism.  It may not be the French thing to do, but it's the American thing to do, and I think we should do so.  So I ask you to vote yes to the proposition before this house.  Let us break up the banks, the big banks that are considered too big to fail.  Thank you. [applause]\", \"Well, what's so interesting to me is the Bank of England is putting forward proposals right now to ring fence the commercial banking operations of complex bank holding companies exactly as I have just proposed.

It is chaired by the secretary of the Treasury.  Republican or Democrat, they report to the president of the United States.  If a bank that has $4 trillion in assets -- and, by the way, a derivatives book of a nominal value or a notional value of 80 trillion, which is JPMorgan, 8-0 trillion in derivatives -- -- if that bank were to be on the verge of some type of failure, do you actually think the secretary of the Treasury and the body that he chairs, which includes the Federal Reserve chairman, would let that bank go under, that any president would allow that to happen in -- [talking simultaneously]\", '-- enormous --', 'Yes or no?', 'What I have proposed, which [unintelligible] what Simon and I are suggesting, is that your exposure as taxpayers should be limited and all government guarantees purely limited to the commercial banking operation of a complex bank-holding company.

And that all other aspects of that business are subject to the same risk of anybody that conducts that kind of business, whatever that business may be.

So it does achieve the purpose of this debate.  All these banks that you acknowledge are too big to fail, you believe that this massive legislation, over 13,000 pages of rules that have been promoted, some 24 plus million hours, for man and women hours, every year to try to discern, interpret and put in place solves the problem of too big to fail.  I don't believe it does so.  I think it enshrines too big to fail.  And I believe, most importantly, it places the smaller banks, who wish to grow and wish to compete and provide services and have a fair chance to compete, on an un-level playing field.  I think what we should all propose is that we go for any bank that is too big to fail, make it too small to save. Exactly what the small banks -- you were saying that the small banks take the same kinds of risks.  You're right.  You know what happens if they fail?  They're shut on a Friday, and they re-open on Monday with a new ownership, and the management is gone, fired, gotten rid of.  I just want the same thing for the large banks.  That's all I ask.\", 'And that would be the outcome of our proposal.', 'I lived through that crisis.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas played the key role in that crisis.  And let me just tell you something, we --', \"-- my comment in the epicenter of exactly what you speak about, Texas.  We lost not only 600 plus small banks, but the sixth, seventh and eighth largest banks in America. They were closed quickly.  They were shuttered.  Isn't it interesting -- no offense to New York -- that Texas is now the most prosperous state in America?  And we did it without too big to fail banks.  And in fact, we closed the banks that then were considered too big to fail.  And Paul Volcker was the master of that closure process.\", 'By the way, on the Verizon transaction, as you know, that was financed by issuing stock.', \"Yep.  And if there hadn't been those four banks, you would have found other banks to do it.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 - Yeah.  When we refer to mega-banks, we're just differentiating the size of the banks in the country.  When we refer to breaking up the banks, we're talking about banks that are too big to fail. And we're talking about basically 11 banks that are presently covered by that status. Systemically important financial institutions.  Some have a simpler book, some have a more complex book.  But I think it's kind of an artificial argument.  Yes, determines a mega-bank, but it doesn't mean it may be too big to fail.  The banks that are too big to fail, so complicated, so large, that even their own managers have trouble understanding the scale and scope of those operations.  That's what we're addressing here this evening.\", \"Wait, wait, wait.  Paul gave us an answer, by the way.  His logic chain is if we had one bank that serviced 320 million customers, we'd be better off.  That's the end of your logic chain -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 -\", 'Oh, come on.

Because the market would then gravitate to those with the most efficient delivery of services and all the services these gentlemen speak of rather than just assuming that they can conduct business with them because they're totally safe at all times.  Only the most efficient would survive.  That's what the American capitalist system is all about.  If you're not efficient you should fail.  If you're efficient you should succeed and grow.  So, to me -- [applause] -- that's what we're talking about here.  We're talking about taking away the fence of protection, that -- you dont yet, but your parents as taxpayers, unless you're a very successful young debater -- [laughter] -- provide, just taking away all those guarantees and just saying you have to stand up on your own legs just like anybody else to compete efficiently.  And, by the way, it may be that XYZ Bank competes better than everybody else and has that business.  That's fine with me, but I do not want to risk another penny of taxpayer money to bail them out when they make a big mistake, and I think that's exactly what will happen, and it will happen in bigger size and it will happen again and it may well, if things go poorly, happen before the waiting period that this gentleman mentioned.

You probably are too young to remember.  That was an argument made that the Japanese banks were to dominate the world, Nomura, et cetera.  Or that French banks would dominate the world.  It hasn't happened.  It doesn't happen because they grow to such a size and scale that they're unmanageable.  I don't fear international competition.  I want to just be the best at what we do.

Why should they be different than -- why should they have different rules apply to them that are applied to everybody else in the industry?  So, yes, it\\'s a huge derivative book.  And, by the way, it\\'s also a question of how the derivatives are balanced in terms of risk.  It could be 40-40. They could offset each other or they could have their own capital at risk.

      "['Oligarchs, rich powerful people who get out of control and they want you to bail them out again.', 'Well, we have to work with them, it seems.', 'Thank you very much.  And thank you, Paul and Doug, for being willing to come out and argue the big banks\\' corner this evening.  This debate is long overdue.  Now, Richard Fisher has laid out for you the case, the economic case, the technical case for breaking up the big banks.  And, now, you should take note of what he says.  He\\'s the president of the Dallas Fed.  He\\'s a man with a great deal of experience in financial markets.  He\\'s also a man who has to be, you understand, somewhat careful about certain statements he makes, wouldn\\'t want to move the dollar or anything in a precipitous manner.  My job today is to tell you the things that Richard Fisher can\\'t tell you -- [laughter] -- because he\\'s too nice a guy and too much of a diplomat.  And a lot of these things are about politics, and I want to cover these precisely by responding to what Paul Saltzman has just said on three main dimensions.  I want to talk about the magic -- supposed magic of banking. I want to talk about JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the world.  And I want to talk about Dodd-Frank, the legislation; the miracle that Mr. Saltzman says has fixed all our Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - problems.  Now, on the first one, on the magic of big banks, have you felt it?  Have you seen around you as the banks became bigger the great improvement in customer service; the reduction in fees; the better access to credit for all Americans? [laughter] No, no, you have not.  You have not. [laughter] And the really -- [applause] -- the really interesting point -- and I\\'m afraid the sleight of hand, and it\\'s a masterful sleight of hand -- in what Mr. Saltzman said is the history.  When did the banks in the United States become so big?  It wasn\\'t 50 years ago.  It wasn\\'t 30 years ago.  It\\'s mostly in the last 15 years. Mid-1990s, the largest six banks in the United States had total assets around 15 percent, 1-5 percent of U.S. GDP.  They\\'re now over 60 percent of GDP, combined.  They\\'re bigger now than they were before the crisis.  This is a recent development.  All -- everyone in this room, everyone listening and watching at home should have felt the magic if there were any magic for you.  There isn\\'t.  There\\'s magic, all right, there\\'s magic in compensation.  If you run a bigger bank, you get a bigger paycheck.  You understand what that\\'s about.  There is no magic of size for the consumer, for the broader economy, for the nonfinancial sector. [applause] Let\\'s talk about numbers.  Let\\'s talk about -- let me talk about JPMorgan Chase.  I don\\'t see Jamie Dimon the room.  He could speak for himself if he is here.  We haven\\'t -- nobody said anything about the numbers, the size.  What is the balance sheet -- total balance sheet measured properly? Include all the derivative exposure using international accounting standards.  It\\'s a $4 trillion bank.  It\\'s about a quarter the size of the U.S. economy.  I\\'m comparing the balance sheet with our annual GDP.  That\\'s a big bank. [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - If JPMorgan were on the verge of failure today, a Wednesday, it\\'s an awkward day for banks, though -- I think one of the big lessons actually from the Clearing House simulation was \"Don\\'t fail on a Tuesday.\" [laughter] It\\'s a long way from Tuesday to the weekend.  We need to get to the weekend.  Do the bailout.  Right?  It\\'s a Wednesday.  It\\'s Wednesday, it\\'s an awkward day, I understand. [laughter] It\\'s an awkward day.  JPMorgan, $4 trillion is going down.  It\\'s a hypothetical.  Please don\\'t rush to tweet that.  It\\'s hypothetical.  JPMorgan is about to fail.  Who here thinks that the president, secretary to the treasury, chairman of the Federal Reserve would let them go?  Let them fail?  Take the hit? Go through bankruptcy?  Does anyone think JPMorgan could fail just like every other business outside of big banks could fail in America?  Could JPMorgan fail?  Anyone want to raise their hand?  Paul, you can raise your hand if you want. [laughter] Anyway, Goldman Sachs.  Goldman Sachs.  Goldman Sachs was a $1.1 trillion bank when it failed.  I\\'m sorry, was rescued by liquidity loans.  I always get those two things mixed up. [laughter] In September 2008, $1.1 trillion bank.  That was up from $250 billion in the mid-1990s when it was one of the best banks in the world, when it provided really good service to individuals and corporate customers.  One of the best banks in the world.  It became a lot bigger.  It became $1.1 trillion.  Anyone think Goldman Sachs could fail.  No.  I see no hands.  One hand.  Good luck to you, sir. [laughter] There is a short seller in every New York audience. [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - [applause] Dodd-Frank, Mr. Saltzman says, Dodd-Frank has solved this problem.  Now, I\\'m a supporter of Dodd-Frank.  I think this is important legislation.  We had to get some of those reforms done.  I worked to help the FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with their implementation of some of the plans for how you manage the collapse of these banks.  Yes, I\\'m a member of the systemic advisory committee for the FDIC.  It\\'s a great, fun job.  I can assure you.  We have terrific parties. [laughter] And, you know, maybe, maybe it\\'ll work.  Maybe the single point of entry, the recapitalization of the holding company, maybe they\\'ll be enough capital.  Maybe the Federal Reserve will insist on preparing these banks properly so when the day comes the damage is more to the management who are responsible and to the creditors who should be on the hook, and to their shareholders who took the risk rather than on the rest of us, rather than on the economy, rather than on the taxpayer, rather than on everyone who lost a job. Eight million jobs lost, $15 trillion in output.  Dennis Kelleher from Better Markets in the second row has the same numbers from his independent assessment.  This is a calamity. Maybe we could avert that danger.  Maybe Dodd-Frank will work and all these pieces will come together.  I would not bet on that.  I do not advise you to bet on it.  I advise you not to take risk out of the world.  You can\\'t do that.  We have no magic bullets. There are no panaceas, but as a matter of responsible action, as a matter of dealing with the problems that confront you, as a matter of reducing the risks that we will face, I urge you today support the motion put forward by Richard Fisher and me, \"Break up the Big Banks.\"  Thank you very much. [applause]', \"Well, I've asked Paul Tucker.  Paul Tucker is the outgoing deputy governor of the Bank of England.  And this is a key issue for the British, because it's a cross-border banking issue. It's incredibly complex.  Ask Paul Tucker this question, can -- specifically this question: can JPMorgan Chase be resolved under some combination of Dodd-Frank and what the British have in place?  And what he says is, Well, we don't quite have the British piece in place yet.  I actually think that to American English the answer's no. [talking simultaneously]\", \"-- if were citing the Bank of England, Paul, then as authorities we should take the -- we should just take onboard their evidence.  And, Doug, on your point today, are there economies of scale and scope in banking, Andy Haldane and his team say there are only such magic for banks if you ignore the subsidy the too big to fail banks receive, if you factor in that subsidy all those nice results that you mentioned go away.  So let's decide where we are in the Bank of England.  Are they an authority on this, or are they wrong on the evidence?\", 'Paul, on the crisis that happened, one word -- [talking simultaneously] -- one word for Paul, one word for you, Citigroup, okay?  Citigroup was at the center of the financial crisis.  But why are we spending so much time, John, talking about the last crisis?  We should be talking about the future.  We should talk about the next crisis. Male Speaker: [inaudible] Simon Johnson: -- too big to fail became a salient problem in the fall of 2008 because the banks said -- they argued, with some justification, \"We\\'ve become so big, you cannot let us fail.\" That\\'s when too big to fail really became the problem that we\\'re now trying to confront.  So what happened in the last crisis is interesting, no doubt, we can argue about it for a long time, but it\\'s what happens going forward, and how do we deal with the too big to fail institutions--', 'Absolutely.', 'Why wait a couple of years?', 'Paul, what we want here is an end to the subsidies.

Why are we a couple of years away?  Well, Dodd-Frank passed in 2010. Three years later, how much of it has been implemented? Relatively little.  Why?  Because there's been a huge pushback from the industry.  Now, Paul and his colleagues are completely within their constitutional rights.  I'm not complaining about it.  I'm merely pointing out that there is an enormously powerful lobby, particularly around these very large banks that has resisted Dodd-Frank.  It's resisted the living wills that Paul mentioned.  It's resisted implementing a lot of other measures that would curtail the range of activities and the power of these very large banks.  That's why we haven't made progress and were not a couple of years away -- we're decades away -- [talking simultaneously]\", 'It was Richard who loves you Paul, not me. [laughter]', \"Well, I don't think anyone is proposing that you shrink all the banks down to some very tiny size.  As I said, Goldman Sachs was a substantial international bank, one of the best Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - international banks in the world in the mid-1990s.  It was less than a quarter of the size that it became at the height of the financial crisis.  So that's exactly what we mean when we say, take away the subsidies, break up the banks; the market will sort out the ones who should fail, the ones who should survive.  Without those subsidies, John, they will be substantially smaller, and they'll be more competitive globally.  You really want big, mega-crazy banks like the Europeans have?  I don't think so.\", \"When I talk to the CFOs of large international corporations, the people who run the financial side of those businesses, nonfinancial corporations, I ask them, do you need -- do you want to have one big global bank handling all your financial operations everywhere in the world?  It's a fair question.  And they say, no, we don't.  What we want is different providers in different places. The idea we would single-source all of our credit, all of our financial transactions, that's actually a bad idea.  We want to have different people, and we want to be able to pick and choose depending on who has a good price -- who has better customer service in a particular market.  So the idea that the big or international business somehow needs colossal at this scale international banks is a complete fallacy.

Jamie Dimon went to see --', \"The London Whale was a trading operation, an individual, a group of individuals in London, lost a lot of money on bad derivative bets and, according to a concession publically made by JPMorgan today, there was market manipulation involved in that transaction.  But the point is, Jamie Dimon went to discuss his legal problems with Eric Holder, the attorney general.  I can assure you, you will not get to see the attorney general should you get into any legal problems.  That is -- there's only one company, according to public justice, there's only one company, as far as they can recall, that has been to see the attorney general.\", \"Well, Paul said the system's working perfectly.\", \"If you remember there was the PBS documentary in which the deputy attorney general who is responsible for bringing prosecution actually said on camera that they've been reluctant to bring not just against JPMorgan Chase, other large financial institutions, they've been reluctant to bring the prosecutions.  That gentleman left office very soon after that statement came out on television.  Look, it's a very uncomfortable statement about American society and the American legal system, but honestly, that is where we are today.  These banks are too big to prosecute effectively.\", \"The problem is weve put huge subsidies behind these businesses.  And particularly with the subsidies of -- behind the derivative book, for example, we are proposing to remove those subsidies.  And we believe, because this is what we see around the rest of the American economy, that when you operate without the subsidies, you get efficiency, people who are not very good at running a business go out of business.  Other people enter and take over.  So that's the dynamic of American capitalism.  All we want for banking and for the operation of these financial markets is what we have in the rest of the American economy.  Why should JPMorgan and the people who run it be exempt from the way the rest of the American economy operates?  What makes them so special, so different?  Is it your point that they have become particularly dangerous because of the business they operate?  You may be right that they are particularly dangerous.  Then I think it's even more pressing issue of public policy.\", '[inaudible]', '[inaudible] simply not true.', 'You just summarized very nicely all the industry papers, the papers written by people who work for the big banks on this topic.

A very large railroad company in the northwest part of the United States. It was one of the first actions of its kind.  It was extremely controversial.  A lot of people in the mainstream didn\\'t know what Roosevelt was doing.  There were plenty of arguments made that these monopolies were modern, they were efficient.  They would benefit the American economy.  J.P. Morgan, the original J.P. Morgan, the man, came to the White House in February 1902.  And he said to Roosevelt and to his attorney general, \"If we\\'ve done anything wrong, send your man to see my man, and we\\'ll fix it up.\"  And Roosevelt and his attorney general, thank goodness, said no.  We don\\'t want to fix it up.  We want to stop it.  This, in Roosevelt\\'s mind, was an excessive concentration of power.  It was dangerous to the democracy.  They took that case all the way to the Supreme Court. They won it 4 to 3.  And out of that came a lot more precedents, antitrust cases, more legislation and, I would submit, the really important change was a shift in the consensus, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 62 - people like you in New York in 1902 didn\\'t know what Roosevelt was doing or why it made sense.  They thought, many of them, it\\'d be bad for business.  In 1911, when the government moved to break up Standard Oil, there were very few defenders of huge monopolies.

      "[\"Well, that's not entirely true because there is and there always has been a peace lobby within the Taliban.  And they do talk to me still, but the hardliners, I agree, don't like me very much.\", 'Kael --', 'The first thing I think to make clear is that unfortunately drones -- which is -- it\\'s a weapon, it\\'s a tool, it\\'s a tactic -- has almost become a strategy in itself, and this is how foreign governments and countries where drones are being used see it.  All the good of U.S. foreign policy, aid, foreign aid, training of security forces, bank loans, et cetera, et cetera, all are demolished when at the same time the U.S. uses drones.  So in fact drones are undermining U.S. foreign policy.  They become the only symbol of foreign policy which people abroad remember when they are -- when those countries in particular are targeted.  And some of the countries like Yemen, like Pakistan are in fact allies of the United States and drones are being used against allies, naturally that is infuriating the population even more. Secondly, how badly have drones affected the counterterrorism strategy, the much more sophisticated strategy that has emerged from the U.S. in the last few years, where the whole strategy is made to protect population, to provide economic incentive, development, et cetera.  Again, here we see the counterterrorism strategy being undermined completely by drones because the people are very scared of them, and they do take out civilian targets just as much as they take out al-Qaeda.  The other question which I think has to be agitating the minds of many Americans is how legal is this? How legal is it to bomb and kill individuals in another country with which you are not at war, with which nothing has been disclosed, there\\'s no transparency involved, nobody is informed as to why and how these people are being killed, and often this is, again, taking place in countries, you know, that are allies of the U.S.  The lack of transparency is not helped by the fact that the CIA has been mostly involved in using drones, especially in Pakistan.  If -- and certainly there\\'s a move now to move some of these drone attacks to the defense department, but -- and that could increase transparency, but at the moment the CIA\\'s running it and nobody knows how these targets are chosen or whether killing these individuals are justified or not.  Now, what all this is leading to is Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - an enormous buildup of hatred for the United States, and that is not just affecting people in the target countries but people all over the Muslim world in particular. It\\'s quite shocking to see the figures in Pakistan.  One poll puts 74 percent of Pakistanis now hate the U.S. more than India, and remember, Pakistan has fought three wars against India, and India is the proverbial enemy.  Another poll that I just read recently in Chicago, yesterday, put it at 94 percent.  And here, as I sit, we\\'re talking about a so- called ally of the United States. Now, what should also be worrying is the precedent that is being set.  What happens when another country will start using drones?  First of all, what happens if a European country, or Russia, or a so-called ally of the United States uses drones?  What is the U.S. strategy going to be?  How is that going to affect U.S. foreign policy?  Are you going to slap that country down?  Are you going to tell that country to behave itself and say, \"No, only we have the right to kill people in other countries.  You don\\'t have that right.\" Even more dangerous, what happens when an enemy of the United States uses drones? What happens if North Korea, tomorrow, uses drones to kill South Koreans?  What happens if Al-Qaeda itself develops drones?  What happens if any -- if the Syrians or any of the problematic regimes, dictatorships, start using drones?  So, what will be the U.S. policy then?  Are you going to go and bomb those countries?  What is the U.S. strategy policy going to be?  There\\'s a complete vacuum here.  There\\'s no thought being given to this.  But this could happen tomorrow.  Drones now are everywhere.  Drones are being used for all sorts of other, peaceful projects.  And any of those drones can be bought on the market and they could be converted into drones that kill people.  And I think that the idea that somehow, the U.S. is going to have a monopoly over this instrument forever is very short-sighted. I think the other thing that is -- that I must answer, the issue of civilian casualties.  There is, for example, a drone strategy now, where drones fire what are called signature strikes.  That is if a bunch of militants are seen or one or two militants are seen in a group of civilians, or sitting in a bus or sitting in a truck, or something like that, drones are used -- can be used to kill that militant.  But of course, they kill everyone else in the truck, too.  Women, children, men, civilians.  Now, the last drone strike, actually, on Sunday, was not the one that the general mentioned, but was one in which 16 civilians were killed.  And President Karzai just complained to the Americans.  And they were killed by a drone, because there were a couple of militant guys in the midst of these people. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - I think they were in a bus or a truck or something like that.  So, the fact is -- I mean, the issue of civilian casualties is very controversial.  The Americans do not tell us what -- you know, how many civilians have been killed.  But estimates from other groups put the casualties in Pakistan alone somewhere between 500 and 1,000.  I mean, that\\'s the level of inaccuracy that we have, because we really don\\'t know.  These areas are inaccessible or -- and the people who would know, certainly, by watching the video screen, the drone firer, that kind of information is available.  And lastly, I think we have to understand how drones have been a recruiting poster for Al-Qaeda and global jihad. Even local groups -- local militant groups in countries which have nothing to do with Al- Qaeda, nothing to do with global jihad -- if they have been droned, they become global jihadists. They want to strike back at America.  They want to kill Americans.  And that is really what is very dangerous, that more and more groups who are really fighting local wars and conflicts are becoming militarized and wanting to strike back at the United States and those other countries.', \"Well, we really don't know.  I mean, but certainly there's enough evidence in countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan that civilians have died in considerable numbers.  Now, that's probably getting less and less as drones become more and more accurate.  But as long as things like what I described, the signature strikes continue, where it is justified for a controller to drop a bomb on a group of people in which some of them may be militants and others not, obviously, you are going to get civilian casualties. And as the admiral said this is a war zone.  And, in a war zone, you're going to get civilian casualties.  The fact of the matter is that this is really undermining and destroying everything else that the U.S. is trying to do in these countries.\", \"Look, I -- if I can just make one point, neither of you two, with all due respect, have addressed this whole issue about U.S. foreign policy and the use of drones.  The fact is that today, you know, you are throwing technology at foreign policy conundrums where you should throw aid, or diplomats, or peacekeepers, or whatever it is. What we are seeing today in many parts of the world where drones are being used, that foreign policy is being subsumed by technology.  We've never had this before.  I mean, how can you allow technology to determine what your foreign policy --\", \"I'm saying that this is the impact that they are having in the countries that received these drones.  This is what the public thinks.  This is why there's so much --\", \"No, it's about drones because drones are a very sinister way of of killing people.  I mean, they're not accepted as a normal -- [talking simultaneously]\", \"no, I don't dispute their effectiveness.  Obviously, this is a military weapon that has been developed to do a certain thing.  And it is going to be further developed, and it's going to be used even more.  I think the point is that it is being -- it is being used very indiscriminately and without any kind of scrutiny or self-knowledge even amongst Americans.  The whole issue of legality, the whole issue of the precedent that it sets for other countries to follow, there are a whole range of political issues and political answers that are needed in order for this weapon to be really legal, be legitimate and be justified.  And that is the point.  I don't dispute at all that certainly many senior members of al-Qaeda have been killed.  But this is a weapon that has opened up a Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 - Pandora's box of questions, especially for those countries who are in receipt of this weapon, you know, at the receiving end.  And I think we need -- we need answers.  I think this question of precedent is absolutely paramount at the moment with what -- if Syria is using --\", \"No, it is a drone.  The drones are an issue because as I said, this is the  most sinister weapon that has come into the marketplace, that, you know, there's no individual behind it.  There's no judgments being made.  And people are very, very scared.\", 'well, this is what people presume, that somehow,  these automatic weapons come up into the sky, and they shoot at will, and they shoot down whatever is on the ground.  I mean, there are all sorts of stories and mythologies about drones which, unfortunately have been created.  And -- and as I said, this is why this weapon -- the chances of this weapon getting out of hand, getting into the wrong hands and being used indiscriminately in many other parts of the world is -- you know, we should take the example of what the reaction already we are seeing in Pakistan, Yemen and other places.', \"Well, I think there's no doubt that there are obviously ungoverned areas and the Pakistanis have not been active enough in undermining and destroying Al-Qaeda.  But I also think that U.S. policy has -- there's been enormous tension between the U.S. and Pakistan over the years, as there has been between Yemen and the U.S.  Now, it's not all centered around drones, but it's centered around, frankly, a lack of long-term strategy and vision by both countries.  And both are to blame.  Now, I think what we need is much greater diplomacy and, you know, diplomatic efforts to strike better relationships. We had a situation where -- as you know --\", 'No.  I think they should continue trying to kill them.  They should be urging the Pakistanis to do much more to do this.  This is the problem, you know?', \"I just want to answer the question which the lady posed, which I think we should go back to.  And I think you're absolutely right.  For the admiral to describe the individuals who are involved in this decision making doesn't give us the criteria.  I mean, what is the criteria for choosing who's going to live and who's going to die?  The fact is the U.S. media itself has portrayed that, the president is sitting there ticking off on a list as to who is going to live and who is going to die, or today, who is going to be drone or not. Now, I mean, we have no idea what the criteria is, how these people are chosen, what is the level of evidence about them being al-Qaeda?  Now, I'm not asking for all this to be made public.  But I think there must be much -- a much greater degree of satisfaction that people understand,  why these targets are being chosen.  And that is just not there at all. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - Male Speaker: I agree.  I agree.\", \"Can I just say one thing first?  And that is that most  allies of the U.S. in Europe, are against drones.  As far as I know, only the British have openly -- support the U.S. policy of drones.  Most of the Europeans, European governments and European parliaments, are against it.  And they've been --\", 'Sorry?', 'Yes.  I mean --', \"They do.  Or they want greater transparency, or they want greater information as to, -- but in other words, nobody in the world basically is backing the U.S. use of drones.  And I think that's very -- that's a point that is often completely forgotten in -- the American media and --\", 'Well, you look at the --', \"Yes.  I think so -- I think that's very true.  And I fear very much that given the turmoil going on now in the Middle East and other parts of the world, the reluctance of the Americans and the Europeans to want to get involved in by putting troops, or Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 - peacekeepers, or anything on the ground -- we're going to get more and more of this, that we throw technology at the problem. We throw drones at the problem.  And that, I think, is going to be a very, very dangerous world to live in, frankly.\", 'I would just hope that you would consider the long term implications of what drones mean -- will mean in the future for the United States, the day that your enemies get hold of drones and use drones against Americans.  The day that even your allies, that drones become a kind of free for all in this world.  After all, the whole crisis that we are facing today over Syria is that the danger of chemical weapons becoming a free for all. Because so many rogue states hold chemical weapons, and if you allow this one to get away then others can follow suit quite easily. And the other thing I\\'d really like to  mention here is that the use of drones has immensely complicated America\\'s relations with its allies.  You look at the situation in three countries where drone bases have been set up secretly, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - The U.S. set up drone bases with the help of the local regime, which were invariably dictatorships of one kind or another.  They lied to their own people, these governments. They lied and said, \"No, no, there\\'s no such thing as U.S. bases here.  There\\'re no drone bases here at all.  These are -- people are being killed by artillery shells, or by bombing, or something else.  And what happened was that the public became more and more anti-regime and anti-American, which led to political crises in certainly two of these three countries.  And it could well still lead to a political crisis in Saudi Arabia.  So, you have now such a complicated scenario operating, where drones are creating -- I mean, one weapon, one weapon, and the use of this weapon is  delegitimizing regimes in the region and also creating immense hatred for the United States. Now, this is just one aspect of what I see as a future fraught with immense problems related to drones, which we are not even beginning to think about and I --', 'Thank you very much.

So, thank you.', \"Thank you.  And I want to say, it's great to be back in New York City.  I was a resident here for four years, and I think it's one of the two most scrappy and resilient places in America.  I won't say what the other one is, but you can probably guess. I also have to say that although our topic tonight is drones, I think in the back of our mind, we know that our nation is having a very important debate about Syria.  And I just Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - want to say I'm grateful that we the people are leading our government on that issue, and at least we're pausing for a while, perhaps, before a decision is made. The issue at hand is the motion that Ahmed and I are going to spend seven minutes each -- as well as the rest of the evening, of course -- we believe strongly that the program is fatally flawed.  Ahmed will cover some of the issues that I won't.  We've divided the labor as follows: he's going to look at lot of the legality questions.  He'll look at -- from his perspective in Pakistan and all the great books he's written -- how much recruiting has actually increased.  And contrary to, I think, some of the conventional wisdom, how effective and how targeted some of these drone strikes are. My points are going to be based on having lived in interesting places like Fallujah, Khost, Helmand .  I view my role tonight as being the ambassador for the people that don't get a voice on this debate, which are really the Afghans and the Pakistanis -- most of the people I sat across a table from and heard the stories after the drones launched the hellfire missiles.  So, if I do that well enough, hopefully you'll get some of their voices, which is what motivated me mostly in this debate, is to not speak as a former State Department official, but to actually speak for the people.  So, it's not a headquarters perspective.  It's not a State Department official perspective.  It's their perspective. One thing left out of my bio was that my mother is a fifth-grade schoolteacher, so if you'll bear with me, I'm going to ask you to do a couple things she taught me.  I've got about 30 seconds to ask you for this, so, the first is show and tell, and the second is a pop quiz.  I'm going to start with the show and tell because -- I think it reinforces, again, what's lost in the drone debate too often. This is a pakol, which is a wool cap that basically, the more rural parts of Afghanistan, you'll see the tribal people wearing.  Again, I'm trying to give voice to these guys, some of my friends.\", \"It's a wool cap that kind of looks like -- I don't know how I'd explain it, but it's a pretty cool cap that's round and rolled up at the bottom.  The --\", 'Worn by Afghans in the tribal regions.  This sparkly cap is called a kandahari, which is what I consider the next generation of leaders that you\\'ll see wearing a lot.  And again, if we\\'re listening to them, what they tell us is basically that the drone program is undercutting them and undercutting their future. And then finally -- and I\\'ll be quick -- I think I\\'m speaking on behalf of the front-line troops, because contrary, again, to conventional wisdom, this Kevlar helmet -- which is a Marine helmet -- I think represents those of us who dodge more IEDs and dodge more bombs when these drone strikes actually don\\'t hit their target. Okay.  The quiz.  If you could pull out a piece of paper, my mom will be proud.  Or if you can take some mental notes -- I\\'m going to ask you two questions, and I think they\\'re important questions, and they\\'re relevant.  The first is, after 12 years of constant warfare, which really started in the scarred city of New York with Lower Manhattan, what words or adjectives do you think Afghans or Iraqis or Yemenis associate with the United States of America?  Nouns, adjectives, whatever comes to mind. And then secondly, what words would you associate with our nation, the United States of America, after 12 years of basically constant warfare?  Second question is, why is May 1, 2010, relevant to this debate?  Don\\'t Google it.  Don\\'t use your iPhones.  But if you happen to -- if that rings a bell with you, we\\'ll come back to it.  The two case studies I\\'m now going to focus on in about the -- half of the time I\\'ve got left are one from Iraq, Fallujah, and a couple basically from Afghanistan. In 2004, drones were not armed.  They were eyes in the sky.  When drones became a fatally flawed program is really the X that I\\'m trying to hit here.  The Fallujans would look up, they\\'d hear a flying lawnmower.  The women would hang their clothes and get awkward and uncomfortable.  The city leaders would come into our meetings and be irritated, but they weren\\'t yet strategically against us.  And, of course, this is the site of the largest battle of the Iraq war.  When did they become fatally flawed, and who did they become fatal to?  I will argue, and Ahmed will argue as well they became fatal to civilians, more than a few.  And they became fatal, I believe, to all of us.  In Afghanistan, in early 2009, marine general Larry Nicholson and I were in a place called Tagaz, which is basically the southern reaches of our area of operation. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - We met a bunch of Marines who were alone and unafraid at the edge of the American military empire, overstretched.  We all know the story.  The next day, in the same location, a suicide bomber blew himself up, killed two marines and killed a corpsman.  If anyone wanted revenge, I did.  If anyone wanted revenge, General Larry Nicholson did. If anyone wanted revenge, the United States Marine Corps did.  Within a few days, we identified some suspicious looking guys who were near the area from above.  Two drone strikes landed a couple hellfire missiles.  One of the men was killed right away.  The other one was split in two.  And we all watched as he tried to drag himself into the hole from the first strike.  He couldn\\'t hide.  He bled out.  He died.  Was it a good guy? Absolutely not.  But was he found out to be directly tied to the attack?  No.  That happens more than we\\'d like to admit.  The next example is based on a New York Times article that just came out on Sunday.  You may have read it, but I wanted to be as topical and as recent as I could. Reportedly 14 Afghans were killed.  So I asked a friend of mine, who lives in Kunar, what he was hearing.  And he quoted a villager who said this:  \"May Allah give me power for one day to use a single drone on the American people so that the American politicians understand how much it pains when a missile comes from the sky and kills your relatives in front of your eyes, and you can\\'t revenge them any more.\"  I\\'ve got another quote, but I don\\'t have time to get there.  In closing, I found a very convincing op-ed by a very senior former member of our government, highly experienced, wrote it brilliantly, brilliant perspective.  And it was titled, \"Drones alone are not the answer.  And it was a New York Times op-ed that came out on August 14th, 2011.  He said, \"the important question today is whether continued unilateral drone attacks will substantially reduce al-Qaeda\\'s capabilities.  They will not.  And I am pleased that he is on stage with us.  It\\'s Admiral Blair.  And I look forward to hearing more comments based on the argument he made in the New York Times.  So I\\'m out of time, but thank you.', \"No, I think that the key part of the ratio of one to seven and one to five is the equals sign behind, and that equals sign is a factor of two, three, four, five.

You know, we tell ourselves often what we want to hear, and that gets translated into memos in Washington, but the Afghan and Pakistani stories that I have heard is that it's -- whether it's one to seven or one to five, it's a lot more than any of us would like to admit to each other.

The law students at Khost University used to ask me, \"What is your case for drones?\"  Just like Guantanamo, just like the language of these wars that we\\'re in.  They are very, very big on how we\\'re doing our wars.  So, if we lose that narrative to Al-Qaeda, I think that ratio is actually the equals sign.  And if I lined up a bunch of Afghans on this stage, I can tell you, what they tell us is probably what we don\\'t want to hear but we need to hear, and that\\'s really the goal for me tonight, is to bring their voice into this debate.

However, I found that the commanders on the ground are the 12 to 14 Marine generals I worked with -- the closer they were to the drones, the more skeptical they were.  Doesn't mean that all of your arguments are false.  It doesn't mean I think every drone needs to be, you know, eliminated from the battlefield.  But the closer you are to where the strategic effect is with the people, the more critical I found the marine commanders to be.  I don't want to speak for all of them, but it was -- it was a pretty clear pattern\", 'Just briefly, I want to actually give voice to a real live Afghan.  And I\\'m going to read a quote.  When that incident happened that the New York Times covered, a friend of mine went to a tribal elder, and this is what the tribal elder said.  Siraj Haqqani, the senior most leader of the Haqqani said that since the USA is using drones against people, the people will use Patriot missiles against the U.S.A.  Someone in the village asked what he meant, where are the Patriot missiles?  Siraj replied, Suicide bombers are our Patriot missiles.\"  The question I don\\'t think we still had answered, for example, on the legality question -- and I know we\\'re not in a law seminar, but it\\'s an important one because it\\'s what motivates terrorists to hurt us.  Because at the end of the day, I think everyone in Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - this room needs to ask fundamental question, which is, are you and your family safer because of the drone program as it\\'s currently structured, or not? What is the legality of the third wave of drone strikes in terms of the triple tap?  What is the legality of that?  What are the lawyers in Washington arguing?  They\\'re not the initial targets.  There\\'s not intel tied to them.', \"Well, we went through a phase in Fallujah where everyone was a military-aged male. And I finally told the generals in Baghdad -- at that point, I was young enough that I was still a military-aged male according to our definition.  We then switched that definition because we started to treat every Iraqi as a potential threat.  And I'll be honest with you, if you're a Taliban member, and you're living in a community around family and friends, with all due respect, I don't think that that makes you a legitimate target.  And that's in effect what's been happening.\", 'Yes and no. Jordan Bennett: Thank you for taking my question.  I just wanted to address this question --', \"I'll briefly -- rules of engagement are pretty tight in marine combat units.  And so, yes, there's going to be blowback.  It's a good question.  It's a very legitimate question.  The drones are being used in Pakistan, northwest province basically, outside [unintelligible], which is a very different arena than in the conventional side, on the Afghan side of the border.  Bottom line is, though is it's what the rules -- the lack of the rules actually, I believe, in our drone program that is the biggest problem.  There is not, for example, a marine general necessarily that technically can command where those drones go because they're operated in a different chain of command.  And we don't need to get too technical, and that may be changing.  But, yes, Afghans are going to respond to a cluster bomb going off or an RPG being launched in the wrong direction.  But I have faith that our forces, if one thing over 12 years have learned, is they've learned quite a bit of restraint.  And then the rules of engagement have gotten a lot tighter.\", \"My view has always been the most important battle going on does not include U.S. Marines versus Taliban.  It's inside the mosques, inside the madrasas, it's inside the communities.  And actually our best allies are the ones that are most critical of this program.  So if we're undercutting --\", 'Well, no, no.  I -- yeah, I\\'m not a person that says, \"All drones need to be taken off -- out of the sky.\"  But what I am saying is that we\\'ve lost the strategic narratives so that General, I\\'m all in favor of not sending in the first Marine division anywhere again for the most part.  However, I think that we\\'ve lost sight of who the best fighters are in these battles.  And it\\'s actually not an American anywhere.  It\\'s an Afghan.  It\\'s a Yemeni. It\\'s a Pakistani.  So when you listen to our allies who want us to succeed, who want us to be safe, they are pretty uniform in their indictment of drones, and -- [talking simultaneously]', \"Well, that's a government to government discussion.  I agree with that.  As far as the tactic, it's what Ahmed my well spoken and famous colleague here at the table have said, which is that the tactic can't be the strategy.  We've enabled the tactic to become a failed strategy and a failed narrative.\", 'Well, yeah, there\\'s a lot of mythology about what seals and drones can do together.

And again, that still hasn't come out.  But all I'm saying is that, again, the battle is a battle that involves them more than us.  And it's a narrative that I think is really the challenge here.  And I think in some ways we agree more than we disagree on who's winning and who's losing that narrative.\", 'Well, yeah, I should have defined ally.  I\\'m talking about the people that I dealt with on the ground.  So whether they were in Khost or in Helmund or even in Fallujah, although the drones weren\\'t armed then, I\\'ll let Ahmed take the bigger issue of the Pakistani Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 - maybe duplicity.  And I\\'m sure there\\'s a lot of double winks that go on every day of the week over there. But my concern is the allies that actually are the future leaders of Afghanistan, the university students, the Madrasa students, the tribal elders, the Mullahs, the whole host of people that get killed in these drone strikes when they go wrong.  Because I don\\'t think the Taliban hold up a red flag.  I know they don\\'t, and say, \"I\\'m Taliban.  What happens is there\\'s a bad guy in the family or a bad guy in the village, and we identify maybe he\\'s a bad guy, and we drop a hellfire, and then you turn three villages against us. It goes to the ratio and the equal sign.  I\\'ll come back to it.  Yes to the woman I thought who asked a very good question, elaborated on by you, our moderator, is the number of enemies we\\'re making and the number of targets we\\'re making.  And I\\'ll defer to you, Ahmed, on the question about his point on as far as the Pakistan government or the Pakistan --', 'Well, with all due respect, I haven\\'t heard a lot of, \"rah, rah, drones.\"  And I\\'ve been in the State Department for 12 years.  So I\\'ll help my friend out here; that whether NATO raises their arm and says, we approve the drone program, I know General Dunford and his political adviser, Carter Malkasian have their hands full all the time on these issues.

Surveillance overhead is a part of war.  The issue is when the drones strike, what the net effect is.  In [unintelligible] Province on the border with Pakistan I can tell you when those one to five, one to seven -- I think numbers to me is not an issue I like to get into because it's that equals sign. Which is how many family members, tribal members, community members are affected by one loss of life?  The IED strikes are where most of our guys are losing their legs.  So do the IEDs go up when an operation like that goes wrong, and you've got a cousin in Miranshah, you've got brothers in Miranshah, and you live in Khost?  I would argue with all due respect that the odds of getting a Marine or a soldier's legs blown off go up because of this program, not go down.\", 'Yes.', \"Fair enough, it's two sides of a --\", 'Thank you.  And I would echo what the general just said.  I -- this is raising the level of debate and we should all be grateful for that.  I\\'ve got two minutes and I\\'m going to run through these pretty quickly.  I opened with a quiz about what words or nouns, adjectives you think they associate with the United States of America after 12 years of constant warfare.  I don\\'t have time to ask you what those words are, but occasionally I would hear words like Apple -- they had the Apple phone -- Obama, money.  But unfortunately, toward the top of that list was D for drones.  It wasn\\'t D for democracy. It actually, to be frank, wasn\\'t the nation-building.  It was the CT.  It was the counter- terrorist platform.  And I think we should think about that. Do we want that to be kind of at the top of the list of what they think about us after 12 years, billions of dollars, thousands of Americans killed, over 100,000 Iraqis, et cetera, et cetera? The second point I\\'m going to now just cite to the question of what happened on May 1st, 2010?  I think it was Admiral Blair who referenced this.  And I\\'ll add a little detail.  It Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 - Nissan Pathfinder.  In that Pathfinder was three 20-gallon propane tanks, a big green metal gun locker that contained a metal pressure cooker pot, 250 pounds of urea based fertilizer, and eight plastic bags with 120 M88s.  The New York City police commissioner, Ray Kelly, said the bomb would have killed many.  The police later on said it would have had shrapnel and probably killed mostly tourists but a number of people.  What did Faisal Shahzad say?  New Yorkers get that. [laughter] What did -- I used to ride my mountain bike through there, but I didn\\'t go very often -- Faisal Shahad was asked by a judge what motivated him to try and blow up that Nissan. Here\\'s what he said, \"Well, the drone hits in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" he said finally, \"They don\\'t see children.  They don\\'t see anybody.  They kill women, children.  They kill everybody.  It\\'s a war.  And in war they kill people.\"  One final point, Boston Marathon bombing, April 15, 2013, I don\\'t have time to read what Dzhokahar Tsarnaev said, but basically he said the same thing, \"We Muslims are one body.  You hurt one, you hurt us all.  The U.S. government is killing our innocents.\"']\n",

[laughter] So the motion is about a dog in the fight. Let me just ask, how many people here have a dog? Okay. So I just want to see if it\\'s a dog friendly audience. I think Aspen is usually fairly dog friendly. So as you think about the argument tonight, consider this, you go around a corner, you confront dogs in a fight, and you think what to do. And compare that with a second case in which you\\'re confronting a dog fight in which one dog has its mouth around the other\\'s throat and you discover that it\\'s your dog. Now, the question is, \"Is this America\\'s dog in this fight?\" So as the moderator reminded us, this assignment tonight is not whether the U.S. should care about the dogs that are tearing each other apart in Syria tonight. It\\'s tragic and anybody who looks at it without having their heart torn ought to have a -- you know, an MRI to see if their heart\\'s turned to stone. The question is, \"How much should we care and what should we do about it?\" So in the language of national security, the question is, \"Does what\\'s happening in Syria so impact American vital national interests that we\\'re compelled to do everything we can including military actions to secure our interests?\" That\\'s what it is to have a vital national interest. And, secondly, if the answer to that is, \"Yes,\" or even if you\\'re a little shaky on that one, \"Has anybody been able to identify a feasible American military intervention that would likely make the situation better over the long run than -- after we had acted than in the case we did not act?\" So if you think about this be clear and let me be as unambiguous as we can.  Our answer to these questions -- these two questions are no and no.  No, the U.S. does not have a vital national interest in what\\'s happening in Syria, and two, no.  No one, is at least to my satisfaction, or Rich\\'s or indeed to Chairman Dempsey, chairman of the JCS, identified a feasible American military intervention, which after the fact would likely make the situation over time better than the alternative.  So, it\\'s to our opponents, I think, to explain how and why they disagree with these judgments, and suggest to us what evidence leads them to that conclusion. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - In these opening comments, I\\'m going to just make some general comments -- general big points, big picture, that bear on the question you have in front of you, and then my colleague, Rich, is going to drill down in more detail.  Four quick points. First, Sam Nunn who is a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, which we\\'re all here as part of, insists that we draw the distinction between vivid and vital.  Because he says whenever something is vivid, especially if it appears on TV over and over and people are being killed, Americans, or many Americans, imagine well, we must have a vital interest there because it\\'s impacting our interests and since we\\'re the world\\'s greatest military super power, maybe there\\'s a military intervention we could undertake to make things better.  In our view, that\\'s not the case here.  This is a vivid, painful, but not vital.  Vital in the dictionary, read it, says essential for survival and well-being. In the mantra of national security it says essential for the preservation of the U.S. as a free society with our fundamental institutions and values intact.  Syria does not meet that test.  Now some of you are saying well, maybe that\\'s too high a test.  I mean, could anything threaten our vital interest?  And I would say in 1990, when Saddam tried to annex Kuwait and threatened the whole possibility of the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, President Bush, the father, chose military action and that was the right choice. John Donvan Graham Allison, I\\'m sorry, your introductory remark time is up and concluded.  Thank you very much, Graham Allison. [applause] John Donvan I want to point out our introductory remarks last six minutes each.  I gave Graham seven because he spent the first time saying such nice things about the other side, and -- although it might have been a sneak attack.  I\\'m not sure. [laughter] Also, your timers will say six minutes from this point forward.  Our motion is: The U.S. Has No Dog in the Fight in Syria, and here to speak against the motion is our next debater, Nick Burns.  He\\'s professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, director of the Aspen Strategy Group, and former undersecretary of state for political affairs.  Ladies and gentleman, Nicholas Burns. [applause] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 -', \"A very good question. I think the U.S. is a global power. And I think -- if I go back to Nigel's point just for a second -- the -- I think you set up a bit of a straw dog with the -- with respect. The notion that there's anywhere we don't care about -- excuse me, we care about things in 200 countries today. Things happening everywhere impact U.S. interests. We don't sit with indifference for Sudan, for Somalia, for Pakistan, for Iraq, for any of the dozen wars that are going on now. But because the ability of U.S. -- both in terms of mind share and also capabilities is limited -- about each case, your question, John, is right -- the very right question. If Syria melts down and comes to be three states or more chaotic than it is today, will this be horrible? Yes. Will it have bigger impacts on U.S. interests? Of course.  Does it rise to the level of vital -- if this --\", '-- such that --', \"That's right.\", \"Does it rise to a level of concern that would lead -- that would compel a responsible government to intervene militarily -- if that's the only way to resolve the issue? And I would say the answer is no. If Syria melts down, this will be horrible. It will have impacts on Lebanon, and on -- and on Iraq, of course. It'll exacerbate the Sunni-Shi'ite division. Of course. All those things are also happening before Syria.\", 'If Syria --', 'Yeah. If we look to the year ahead, Iran getting nuclear weapons.', \"Yeah. I think your -- Nigel, what you're saying is persuasive. But -- okay. The Free Syrian Army representatives and the opposition -- as Rich said -- a lot of Americans know them. These are guys that we meet in Turkey. You don't see them fighting on the ground in Syria. So, they're spending their time talking to folks like us, not having any control over 1,200 different groups who are fighting independently. Chairman Dempsey said last week -- in that -- or two weeks ago -- in very important testimony he says here, just a quote About six months ago, we had a very opaque understanding of the opposition. Now I want to say it's even more opaque. [laughter]\", 'And the answer is, of course it is.', \"And of course the U.S. is acting. I mean, let's be clear. Who is the largest supporter of humanitarian assistance to Syria today? The U.S. President Obama announced last week another $195 million. We have a billion dollars, and we should be doing much more, and we should be raising much more from other parties.\", '[inaudible] that -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 -', 'I think that\\'s a good analogy, and I think in that instance there were very special circumstances. Nick has actually written about this. And he and I agree on this. There were very special circumstances in which a limited U.S. military intervention made the difference at the margin to get to a better place. And I think that was a good example. In this instance, why is it different? We have an old professor that used to make a list where you draw it down the middle of the page, you say, \"Similar,\" and  \"Different.\" The similarities in this case are superficial. The differences are profound.', \"Very briefly, I think the question was right on target, and I think to Nick -- we're not doing nothing.  Nobody's proposing doing nothing.  As I said before, we're the largest humanitarian assistance being provided.  We're trying to work with the neighbors.  The U.S. military is currently in Jordan and Turkey trying to prevent the spread of the violence.  We're currently trying to work with an international coalition to get negotiations going.  We've been trying to get a peace negotiation in which the Russians would be co-hosting some negotiated outcome, which is our best hope.  All those things we're doing, not successfully I would say, so the question is if it continues in this way with the killing and all the other things that we find as negative impacts for us, if it's so important to us, that if the only way to secure our interests is military intervention, we should do so.  And we think the answer is, unfortunately, no.\", '[inaudible]-', \"This is a -- it's a great question. And I was talking to one of the leaders in the Israeli National Security community, who's a good friend of mine, last week. And so, I asked him just your question. Does Israel have a dog in this fight? And he says, Absolutely not. Let's be clear if there's this transfer of advanced arms by the Syrians to people who are fighting Israel, like Hezbollah, we are acting -- and we're acting now -- so, Israel has attacked half a dozen times, particular instances of transfer. But he said, our official position and our operational position is we will not intervene in the civil war. That's the quote.\", \"Absolutely great question. I would say that our hope would be -- and the best hope -- but it's a stretch -- but the best hope is a situation in which the combination of humanitarian assistance to the victims and close working with the neighbors in the region and a strategic concept of a government that could exist after a transition leads to a negotiation in which there's an extended transition of power. And I would say that's a stretch. That's a distant hope. But the alternatives to that -- if I looked at them -- are worse. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -\", '[unintelligible] one more --', \"I -- I mean I think Nigel is speaking directly to the point. But I would have to -- Fareed Zakaria who has been struggling with this a lot -- had a good line recently. And I wonder if you disagree. He says, quote, We want an outcome in Syria that's even more ambitious than the one we sought in Iraq. And yet, we imagine that we can get it by a no-fly zone or even less than that. So, do you disagree with that?\", \"Well, I would say in one word, no, okay?  The situations are entirely different.  There are numerous places in the world where the U.S. does have vital interests. There usually we have an alliance.  For example, Israel we regard as an ally.  If there's an attack on an ally we think this reaches the level of a threat to our vital interest, and for those we are prepared to act.  There are many, many other situations in the world in which we're not prepared to act.  That doesn't mean that on some occasions we don't. North Korea is a good example.  But it seems to me that we went around everywhere saying to everyone if something bad happens in Somalia we're going to become involved militarily.  If something happens in Sudan we're going to become involved militarily.  If something happens in Pakistan, where there's an even bigger war right -- we're going to become militarily involved.  We will soon find the U.S. everywhere.\", \"Thank you. My old professor, Henry Kissinger, has a cushion in his home office that says, Try to be the person your dog thinks you are. [laughter] Okay? So, if you find your dog in the fight, you're obliged to do everything you physically can -- including risks to your own life and limb -- to rescue your dog. Okay? I had that experience only once. I almost killed a German Shepherd that had its jaws around the throat of our little Corgi, Annie. And I hope I never have such an experience again. So, that's to have a dog in the fight. As you think about your vote tonight, I would say, ask three questions -- I would urge you to consider three questions. First, we are just exiting two wars in which we entered without understanding the realities of the country to which we sent Americans to fight -- [applause] So, who imagines that we understand what's happening in Syria better than we did in Iraq and Afghanistan? Second question -- this has come up in the debates that we had the Aspen Strategy Group this week. There're almost parallel realities. On the one hand, foreign policy experts look abroad and say, Here dragons: this is a problem, this is a danger. We need to mount an effort. But there's another reality, which is where is this country today? Look at Washington -- not just broke, but broken. Stalemated. Unable to even have a budget. And maybe on a drift to a closedown of the government. Is this a government that's ready to engage in yet another military operation? Finally, I would say -- it -- for those of you -- [applause] -- for those of you that have children or grandchildren, if you imagine that by voting that we have a dog in the fight, you were at risk of sending your daughter or son to Syria, how would you vote?\"]\n",
      "['Yes. [applause]', \"Thank you, John. I must just start by saying, this is an immensely difficult and tragic problem. And it's very hard to take clear positions when something is so difficult and hard to solve. I will say, however, that there are some things that divide the two sides of the debate. And one, as my colleague Graham said, is really what it means to have a dog in the fight. And we stand for a view which says it means you have a vital and national interest at stake which makes it so compelling that you lead and do whatever is necessary to make sure that your vital interests are protected. And we don't think that exists in Syria.  Graham made the case in summary for us. There are many things that we are doing as a country, that we could do, that we should do. We heard some of those from Nick. We may hear some more from Nigel. But the real question before us is is the interest engaged in Syria so vital that we must lead and be centrally involved and possibly intervene militarily to remove Assad from power? And we think the answer to that, unfortunately, is no. Graham made the argument in summary. I want to elaborate it in three ways. First, to give you a little bit of ground truth about this conflict. Second, talk about chemical weapons. And third, the issue of supplying light arms. On the ground truth in the conflict -- this is not a simple conflict of good versus evil, though Assad certainly is evil. And it is not a single conflict. This is many different conflicts. And frankly, a fatal flaw in Nick and Nigel's position here is there is no opposition for us to support. You'd think that if you had a dog in the fight, you could at least have a name for the dog on the other side. But it's not good enough to say the Syrian people or the Syrian opposition, because the fact is, there is no unified opposition. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - And there is no connection between the mostly exile-based political leadership and the fighters on the ground. I -- we're so draconian on time. I can't really go through all the different factions of Syrian fighters and political entities at the moment. But there's the Syrian Free Army, the Syrian Liberation Front, the Syrian Islamic Front, the Al-Nusra Front, various Kurdish groups, independent groups -- all of whom are, in fact, umbrella groups of smaller numbers of fighters out there in the field running their own operations. And in that context, we -- there are also organizers, The National Coalition, who are mostly outside of the country, not connected to the fighters on the inside, and not able to dictate what happens on the ground. And so, this is a real problem. If you want to have a dog in the fight, to not have the slightest idea who it is, and to hope that it will come together. And in fact, the most effective and vicious and aggressive fighters in this conflict are ones with whom we would never side. The one -- the last one I mentioned was the Al-Nusra front. This is a wing of Al-Qaeda. It has sworn allegiance to Ayman Zawahiri. So, yes, we -- now, so we have -- we really have two dilemmas in Syria. We've got Assad aligned with Hezbollah, a Shi'ite extremist terrorist group. And the most effective and operationally effective opposition group being one who is completely anathema to us to the point that we've designated them a foreign terrorist organization.  So, how can you have a dog in the fight when you can't even identify the dog? Second, on chemical weapons -- Assad has a massive chemical weapons arsenal -- comprised primarily of nerve gas -- sarin, DX, and mustard gas. Can't go into the details of what it is, where it is. It's not in a condition that can be easily and quickly used, but it is very dangerous. One of the dilemmas we face here is that it is currently controlled by the Assad regime and the Alawite sect. And we do have -- maybe a vital interest -- certainly a very strong interest in ensuring these weapons are not transferred to Hezbollah and they are not used against Israel, Turkey, our allies in the Gulf, our own forces. And unfortunately, this is actually a sort of restraint on our power. Most of the more aggressive forms of intervention and keeping the military balance in the favor of the rebels will lead -- at least temporarily -- to a loss -- a higher risk of loss of control of the chemical weapons. We cannot forget that. Finally, on -- and I want to say something about what I'd call the moral hazard of half- measures. We have -- as an unfortunate leitmotif in American foreign policy -- which is every so often, we give support and comfort to groups with which to rise up against an Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - autocrat. And then we get cold feet and leave them dangling. And we did that in Hungary in 1956. We did it in the Bay of Pigs in '61, in Prague in 1968, in southern Iraq in 1991. And we need to be very careful about small half measures in steps which are -- really have no prospect of success but do make us complicit in the violent outcome which we really cannot control and cannot dictate. And so for that reason it strikes me as that, yes, of course, we should stay involved and engaged diplomatically, and politically there is room for that, but to begin a process of arming a number of rebel groups we can't even control, and don't know, and, frankly, don't trust, I think, is a very dangerous first step since we really are not ready to go the distance. And, in fact, very few people, and certainly none of them on this panel I think, are truly ready to go the distance, which, by the way, we all would be if it were a vital national interest. And that's the essence of the problem here. We want to make it better but it really is not so vital to allow us to be ready to do everything it takes to get the outcome that would be better for us and the region. Thank you.\", \"There's a lot of information that's coming out of Syria now, about what the people engaged are suffering from this fighting. Actually, I think -- and as far as they're concerned, we're sitting this one out. I mean, there's -- there is -- they're very clear, the reporting out of Syria is the U.S. is having no impact on the ground. In fact, the narrative looks more like Al-Qaeda is having an impact and Hezbollah is having an impact. But we are not. The -- it strikes me, as you kn0w, President Obama is stuck with no good options. And this will go down in history as a failure of his policy. But he's confronted only with options which make the failure even worse, because in order to really make an impact here, we have to make a difference on the ground. It's not enough to figure out who to write a check to or ship a bunch of light arms to. You have to figure out, who are we Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - tipping the military balance in favor of so that there's a better outcome at the end. And we are not doing that at this time.\", 'Yes.', \"Well, first, it's not as though we're inactive. We're doing something. It's just not making any difference. And there's two halves -- [laughter] [applause] -- and this has been the case for a long time. I mean, this has been -- how long ago was it that President Obama said he needs to go? Assad needs to go? But there's two halves of the argument. The first is about vital national interests. And I think -- it seems to us that you agree with us, that it -- we haven't met that bar. But there's a second half, which is, you need to reasonably articulate a plan that gets you to a better place when you're done. And if you're unable to do that, then you are, by default, stuck with the bad consequences of inaction or of a policy that really isn't making much difference. And so, it -- in fact, the onus is on you to articulate an alternative plan that gets us somewhere -- when -- [applause] -- the interestingly -- you know, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff just testified to this effect for his confirmation hearing. And he basically said there isn't one. And he was -- he went through six different options. And he said, all of them -- none of them work.\", 'This -- Nick said a key term there, and I think their entire argument hangs on a very slender thread around the key term of \"moderate opposition.\" And so we do, in fact, have a national coalition that was in December, not that long ago, recognized by the, quote, \"friends of Syria,\" as the place to send the money. But it is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood, and it is essentially a playground for Qatari, Saudi, and UAE -- and Turkish influence peddling, that is internally divided, that has achieved notional external legitimacy, since someone has to get the money, but has no internal legitimacy. The Free Syrian Army, our best hope for the moderate people on the ground fighting, is not integrated in any way. It\\'s a loose umbrella of dozens of different fighting groups. And let\\'s just be clear, our friends in the Free Syrian Army, they were the ones who criticized us for deeming the Al-Nusra Front a terrorist organization because they coordinate their operations occasionally and the Al-Nusra Front bailed them out of a situation where they were about to get annihilated by the Syrian Army. So these are our friends? This is the moderate opposition and the dog that you think we have? I mean, this -- we don\\'t get to pick the dominant post-Assad faction in Syria.', \"I think -- first Nigel is correct that in order to get a negotiated settlement with Assad, you do need to change the situation on the ground. You do need to change the balance of military power in one way. In fact, it has changed in the last year in two ways -- Hezbollah entered in force from Lebanon. And Al-Qaeda entered in force from Iraq. Not us. And so, I think the basic diplomatic premise is correct. You need to shift the military balance in such a way that it is in their interests to achieve a negotiated settlement. Now, that's -- the problem with that is that's what we call a proxy war.  And so, it is a recipe for entering a proxy war in Syria, not just against Assad, but against Al-Qaeda. And so, proxies are what we do when we want to change the military balance in a country but don't want to be there ourselves. And so, you are left with no alternative on your side of the debate if you do want to change the ground -- the situation on the ground but to engage in a proxy war in Syria which the military analysis -- which is not favorable to that case.\", \"A lot hangs on your assessment of the character of the Syrian state. And one of the key differences between Tunisia and Egypt, lesser extent Libya, is the sectarian division in Syria is far worse. And so the speed with which the protest took off and the violence took off was not merely a moderate bourgeois rebellion against an autocrat. It was the emergence of a sectarian conflict which has been suppressed by force by the Alawites, a Shiite sect, for years, at least going back to 1970, and where the only other active political entity, the Muslim Brotherhood, was destroyed viciously by Assad in Hama.  So, I mean, to say that -- to hang so much on the idea that a moderate Syrian secular leadership and consensus will emerge, as Graham says, that's -- we didn't even develop that in Iraq.\", \"I'm arguing the U.S. has no dog in the fight. I don't have a crystal ball but I doubt it. I doubt that the new elected president controls it. It's a longstanding -- I mean, Syria is Iran's last friend in the region. Their support for Hezbollah goes back to 1982. Syria's the funnel through which the arms get to Hezbollah. And the new president is not, in fact, the supreme leader. The supreme leader is the supreme leader.  And so this policy Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - seems pretty well marbled in the Iranian state, and I doubt it will change of its own accord just because of an election.\", \"So, if we interpret this motion as do we care, there's no difference between the two panels.  We do.  I think Graham, I, Nick, Nigel, we equally abhor this violence, and if we could stop this butchery we can, we would.  But the proposition before us is what to do about it.  And here, I think you've heard slightly different prescriptions from Nick and Nigel and I'm going to choose to focus on the one I heard from Nigel, which I think is correct, that a political outcome in Syria requires changing facts on the ground. In order to change the facts on the ground you need to tilt the military balance against Assad in some way or another.  That is what we call a proxy war. I have no objection -- on a principle basis -- to proxy warfare. But I do, on a pragmatic basis, which is if we are going to get into them, we should have a reasonable belief that we can succeed. And that, unfortunately, is not the case here. And it's not the case for several different reasons, one of which is our proxy is not very reliable, and in fact, not very powerful, this moderate opposition. Another is the opponent is deeply entrenched and their own sponsors -- Hezbollah, Iran, Russia -- are completely uninhibited by the strength that we have. Russia is sending advanced anti-aircraft systems to Syria right now. There -- and apparently lawful under international law. And we can't even -- we struggle over whether to send light arms. So I think the other side, though they wish to avoid saying we're for military intervention -- in fact, the essence of their political strategy requires a change of the military facts on the ground. And that involves giving military support to the fighters. That is that we call a proxy war. And unless you are very, very sure that you will prevail in the end, it strikes me as an unwise policy. And if you interpret the motion that way, I think you need to say -- invoke with -- where Graham and I stand.\"]\n",

      "['Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - I think that makes me a realist, honestly.  We face a pretty bleak road, particularly if we continue to cut as proposed under sequestration and [unintelligible].', 'My partner is Andy Krepinevich.  Probably much to his astonishment, a former teacher of mine, but one of the most astute defense analysts who I know.', 'Thanks, John.  I\\'d like to echo the thanks that my colleagues gave to the IQ people and the McCain Institute people.  I\\'d like to thank the audience too.  It\\'s a beautiful day and coming in here and talking about defense budgets is perhaps not the way I would spend my afternoon if I had a choice. [laughter] The smartest soldier of all time said that everything in war is simple, but the simple things are difficult.  And this debate is a perfect example of why that\\'s true.  We\\'re really talking about three things and how they relate to one another.  We talk about money and budgets.  And you\\'ve already heard a fog of numbers being thrown out and slices of pies being alluded to.  It\\'s a lot of money that we\\'re talking about.  But I would ask you to consider defense spending in a different way, as not just a cost proposition but a value proposition.  Are we getting a return on our investment that\\'s worth it as taxpayers and Americans?  I would say absolutely.  Andy says for 3 cents out of our dollar, whether we\\'re getting the global dominance that Ben suggested or merely treading water, we have a remarkably peaceful world. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - There hasn\\'t been a great power war since the end of World War II.  And personally, I would like to keep it that way.  That\\'s something that I can\\'t quite put a price tag on. And what we\\'re spending now is certainly affordable.  So ask yourselves, is it worth the money we spend?  That\\'s the way I would ask you guys to consider the proposition. Second part is even more unpleasant, the idea that we have enemies in the world.  We don\\'t like to think that as Americans.  You know, we wish everybody loved us and we try to love them, but it is a dangerous world.  Ben sort of downplayed all the threats that are out there.  We\\'re going to have a discussion about that.  Reasonable people can differ over who\\'s the biggest threat and what the size of the danger is, but, again, do you want to take a risk with this?  If we\\'re much stronger than our enemies, is that a bad thing?  They\\'re not all enemies.  There\\'re people who are sitting on the fence one way or the other. I would prefer to live in a world where we have fewer enemies and the ones that might be enemies don\\'t want to mess with us.  And, again, I think that\\'s a great value proposition.  The final part of the proposition is whether it\\'s a gift to our enemies or not. As Andy said, \"We don\\'t know whether it\\'s a gift, but it is already, we can tell, a dangerous temptation,\" as we see in the Middle East today.  As we have come home from Iraq and we\\'re about to depart from Afghanistan, we see in Syria a war that\\'s metastasizing, it\\'s like the Iraq civil war that we saw in 2006, only on steroids, much more so.  So is that a gift to our enemies?  I don\\'t know.  It\\'s not a gift.  Going to war is never a gift.  Our withdrawal from the world after World War I was not a gift to Germany and Japan but it was a dangerous temptation to Adolf Hitler and to the Imperial Japanese. World War II was a gift to nobody but it was a necessary thing to do and a temptation to evil people in the world, and there are evil people in the world.  So well work through all these questions.  I like it that we have allies.  They provide the battlefield. That -- you can\\'t put a price tag on that.  It\\'s better to fight over there than it is here at home.  So having America be powerful as well as be engaged in the world out there in the world has created a world that\\'s more prosperous, that\\'s safer, and for Americans possibly the most important point is freer than it has ever been in human history.  We should not give that up.  You don\\'t win prizes in war for being the guy who does it in the cheapest way.  There are no style points.  The outcome is what matters, and that\\'s what we should be focusing on when we weigh this proposition.  Is it a gift to our enemies? No. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - That is a temptation to them, it\\'s a risk for our friends, and it could be a real danger to us.  We send very few Americans -- we have -- the world is so peaceful, and our military is so good that it only takes less than 1 percent of us to maintain the peace.  I think that\\'s worth a priceless investment, almost.  Vote for us. [applause]', 'Well, I like to do the crime before I do the time.  So no. You know, dominance is a loaded term, no question. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 -', \"Yeah, no. [laughter] Thomas Donnelly: I noted that.  But I'll cop to it.  You know, it doesn't bother me if America is stronger than everybody else times two or three.  America's role in the world, from my perspective, has been pretty positive.  And the use of American military power has made a better world, and so I'd rather be dominant than weak.\", 'No, I mean, I think Ben laid it out very well.', 'Its not an efficiency, it is a choice, a choice to have less power and to withdraw.', \"Well this is extraordinary reminiscent -- I mean, this is the kind of talk you heard out of Donald Rumsfeld before 9/11.  490,000 was too small.  We proved that by being unable to do Iraq and Afghanistan properly at the same time, so I don't think that was a good experience.  And I don't want to expect that the world is going to be technologically Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - transformed and that the art of war is going to be fundamentally different than it's ever been in human history. That seemed like a bit of a long shot to me, too.  So numbers matter, and we have just proved that in spades over the last decade.\", \"There are some things that you cannot do with technology.  And we have actually, you know, fought irregular wars and counterinsurgencies in the most technologically sophisticated way ever, but I don't think the result was satisfactory.\", 'I think we -- as Andrew says, if you read the newspapers, or listen to NPR, or whatever --', \"Again, I -- when I read the newspapers in the morning, or read the news online, or however I get my news, what I see is people feeling for openings in weak spots.  We see that very much in Syria and Iraq.  The war has spread to western Iraq, northern Jordan, et cetera, et cetera. We see that in the Pacific, in the South China Sea, where the Chinese, even without an aircraft carrier, are nudging and pushing at what Ben calls the various rocks in the South China Sea; the things that really matter to our allies, people who are our treaty allies, like the Filipinos.  I don't want there to be a war over a rock in the South China Sea.  And what we see is people feeling for how far they can go in the absence of an American military presence.\", \"One of the things that technology has yet to solve is how to be in two places at once.  As advanced as our military and -- is -- pardon me -- you know, if it's not there, it's not there.  And what we see in the world now is the effect of us not being there. China doesn't want to go to war with us.  They probably want to go to war with us even less than we could ever possibly want to go to war with them.  They want the benefits of nibbling away, pushing the limits.  They want to intimidate the Filipinos and the Taiwanese.  They don't want to mess with us.  But if we're not there, there are going to be consequences.  And you see it every day.\", \"Yeah.  One thing, look, we need to get sort of the best bang for the buck that we can under any circumstances, whether we're spending more or spending less.  On the other hand, compared to other forms of government, I would offer the Pentagon is actually, again, a good value proposition.  If the public education system educated my kids as well as the military does its job, both my kids would have gone to Harvard, and they didn't. You know, if my doctor kept me as healthy as the military kept the world, I would live forever.  So as a government function for all the waste, fraud, and abuse that there may be in the department -- and I wish it were zero -- it's relatively less. And the dollar amount is really trivial when we're talking about the size of the federal debt or the deficit.  Look, we spend as much per year almost -- and if interest rates actually go up to a market rate, more on servicing our current debt than we do on military power.  So in the relative size of things, we're not talking about a lot of money. You know, trillions and trillions, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.  But compared to the rest of the economy or what the government spends, this is peanuts.\", \"The original question posited a correlation between less war and less dying in recent years.  That correlates really strongly with the rise of American power.  So, again, that's what I was talking about originally.  This has produced great benefits, not only to us, but to humanity -- [applause] -- and there's -- and Kori will remember this from her own time in the White House.  The problem with diplomats is that if you want to send them to Afghanistan, at least until recent years, they could say no.  They could refuse to go.  So we need all the tools in our kit bag of all kinds, but we should not pretend that military power isn't part of what needs to be in that kit bag. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -\", \"I don't think we -- no, we don't disagree with it.  Again, we have to keep things in perspective, as -- although I would add to that, we're not suffering from what, you know, the historian Paul Kennedy called imperial overstretch. We're suffering from things like entitlement overstretch.  The money that we're spending that's impoverishing us is not going, for the most part, to buy military power. It's going to buy other things that the government does, like provide social services. Whether that's a good thing or bad thing or not, I -- you know, people can reasonably disagree.  But that's where the money is going.  And if we want to reform both the federal government's books and to boost economic productivity, we can't do it by cutting the defense budget.  We have to do it in other ways.\", \"Well, thanks to you all for listening to this sometimes unhappy and complex debate.  I still think that the basic proposition is pretty simple and straightforward.  And I guess that's why I'm not a political scientist and I'm more of a historian because that's the experience that -- and the measures, the outputs by which I would judge this proposition.  Kori keeps talking about Americans building a better mouse trap.  The world that we have built over the last seven decades is a really good mouse trap. It's a complex mouse trap, as Kori suggested.  There are lots of things that go into making a liberal peace.  But it's not a liberal peace that invented itself.  The Europeans didn't, after five centuries of slaughtering one another and slaughtering the rest of the peoples in the world, decide -- get all together and say, you know, I think we should cut this out.  Not even the imperial Japanese.  They were defeated in war by the United States, and because of that, they've become liberal democracies and pretty peaceful ones too.  So I don't know what the marginal difference will be, but it's not an experiment that I want to make.  We've seen what's happened with the marginal cuts of the last couple of years.  We see what's happening in Syria today.  We see the Chinese messing about in the South China Sea.  Are they coming to our shores tomorrow?  No. But let's not let it come to that point. A marginal difference.  We don't want to know where the last margin of safety is.  It's better to have more margins of safety than less.  And that's really what this proposition comes down to.\"]\n",
      "[\"Well, since Eisenhower retired as a five-star general and I retired as a lieutenant colonel, I think he's probably going on looks. [laughter]\", 'Thank you, John.  And behalf of my partner, Tom Donnelly, I\\'d also like to thank Intelligence Squared U.S. and the McCain Institute for sponsoring this debate.  And also compliment our worthy adversaries, without whom we could not have a debate here Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - tonight. Tom and I, in terms of this proposition, believe that further cuts in our defenses will encourage our adversaries, and at the same time, increase the risks to our security, our economic well-being, and the security and economic well-being of our allies and partners around the world.  In terms of the overall perspective -- but let\\'s take a look at the big view.  At the end of the Cold War, 20 years ago, we were spending, on average, 6 percent of our GDP every year on our defenses.  Six percent.  Okay? In the span of 20 years, this year, we\\'re down to three percent of our GDP being spent on defense.  So we have cut in half the amount of our national wealth that we have devoted to our defenses, okay?  I don\\'t think you can find another major part of the federal budget where you have this kind of cut.  So, that\\'s point number one. Point number two is if you look at the defense budget, you see several, I think, important things.  One is 30 days ago this year, we decided -- we made a social choice, to adopt a volunteer military.  And we never really fully paid the price of that choice until after 9/11, when we engaged in a protracted conflict in Afghanistan and then in Iraq.  In order to recruit and retain sufficient members of -- service members to conduct those operations, we\\'ve had to increase personnel spending by over 50 percent, after inflation, since 9/11. So that\\'s a dramatic increase.  On top of that, the Obama Administration has set forth a revised defense plan which looks to cut nearly half a trillion dollars out of our defenses over the next 10 years.  So what do you get?  You get a shrinking defense pie, number one.  Number two, within that shrinking pie, you get an expanded slice for personnel costs.  What does that mean?  That means in the coming years, we\\'re going to see a lot less funding for training, a lot less funding for maintaining our equipment, and a lot less money for replacing all the worn out equipment.  I\\'ve been to this movie before.  This is the equation for a hollow military.  This is the equation for a military that gradually loses its effectiveness and capability. Now, how will our enemies react to this?  Is this a gift to them?  I don\\'t know.  I\\'m not -- I\\'m not privy to their thoughts.  What I can tell you is that the silence is deafening.  And as Napoleon once said, When your enemy is in the middle of making a great mistake, don\\'t interrupt them.  And again -- so you have this particular situation.  Now, some people say, Well, gee.  We\\'re pulling out of Afghanistan.  We\\'re out of Iraq.  Let\\'s reduce defense spending.  After all, the threat is diminishing.  Well, first of all, our operations in those conflicts were funded by something called OCOB, the Overseas Contingency Operation Budget.  And those budgets are coming down and will go down to zero.  But the base defense budget --- typically, when you draw down that budget, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - that is when the threat is declining.  And as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, we\\'re in a situation right now where the threat is not declining. He had a pretty good short list, but there\\'s a longer list we can go through.  John mentioned that we brought together four think tanks, from the moderate liberal to the moderate conservative, a few weeks ago to look at the sequestration cuts.  And these are cuts -- let\\'s -- hey, let\\'s cut another half trillion dollars out of defense over the next decade.  Despite the fact that there\\'s a fair part of the political spectrum that was covered, there are two conclusions that the four think tanks agreed upon:  The first is that cuts of the magnitude that are discussed and put forth in sequestration will be a disaster in terms of our military readiness and capability.  Second, there is a belief -- again all four think tanks -- belief that the dangers to our security, the dangers to our economic well-being are increasing over time. We\\'ve cut our budget since the end of World War II in the past, it\\'s been when the threat\\'s been declining, not when the threat\\'s been increasing.  So to sum up, those who advocate further cuts to our defenses as a way to put the fear of God into our enemies, kind of remind me of what the duke of Wellington once said about his own troops.  He said, \"I don\\'t know if they scare the enemies, but by God, these people scare the hell out of me.\"  Thank you. [applause]', \"Ben was kind enough to cite my Foreign Affairs article.  In the article, even absent the sequestration cuts, I said we're going to have to really trim our sails.  We're not going to be able to fight or deal with threats in two different regions, even though there are three regions in the world we consider to be vital interests.  We're not -- maybe -- I think this is a good thing.  We're not going to be able to threaten anybody with regime change. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - I think we're going to struggle just to maintain access to critical regions where we have trading partners and resource requirements.  We haven't figured out a way to deter cyber attacks.  And the cyber threat is growing.  We haven't figured out a way to protect our assets in space.  And I think the next big thing coming down the road is the undersea infrastructure which is huge.  And with the spread of robotics, increasingly accessible even to non-state groups who can threaten the enormous energy infrastructure that in military parlance is comprised mostly of soft targets.\", 'The problem --', 'The problem is right now that, you know, efficiency is everybody\\'s favorite solution, you know.  We have efficiencies, magic happens, and then all of a sudden we save all this money.  Weve been going to that movie for about 50 years now, and the result is always the same.  We put the cart before the horse.  You know, let Congress and the political leadership take on the responsibility, exercise the moral courage to make these changes before we saddle our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines with the problem. I was talking to one -- in fact Secretary Panetta -- and if you dont already know, he\\'s very fond of colorful language.  And I raised the issue of efficiencies.  And he said, That\\'s a bunch of bologna, although he didn\\'t use the word \"bologna.\"', \"And, you know, for those who say, Well, we spend more than others, well, as I mentioned earlier, we have a volunteer military.  What kind of military do you think we'd have if we paid our soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines what the Pakistanis pay theirs or what the Russians pay theirs or what the Chinese pay theirs?  As Tom said, do you want to wait until the enemy is at your shores and then start figuring out how to deal with the threat?\", \"I think Kori, I think, hit on a good point, which is we're going to need not to do more of the same.  We're going to need to begin to think about things differently.  As Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, the problem set is becoming quite a bit different than Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - Afghanistan and Iraq.  The problem is, as I mentioned before, that when you've got a shrinking budget and exploding personnel costs, what gets squeezed out are science and technology, research and development of new capabilities, training and exercise to test out these capabilities to find out what works and what doesn't. And so you're stuck making a big bet, and you hope it'll work, but you really don't have the chance to test it out.\", \"I'm just saying that we are only at the dawn of sequestration, and all you have to do is read the papers. The Air Force is cutting back on training, the Army's cutting back on training, the Air Force can't replace its aging aircraft in part because we screwed up over the last decade or so in terms of the procurement approach.  But, again, that's poor excuse for compromising our security and punishing our service members.  So yeah, were mistakes made?  Certainly they were.  You know, does that mean we give up on our security because we didn't get it right or is that -- do we ignore what's going on now?\", 'But then we still have the personnel problem.  And part of the Budget Control Act, the president was given the option of exempting personnel costs and personnel cuts, and so again you have that situation where you have this personnel budget that is crowding out everything else.', \"I'm sorry?\", 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - Benefits -- you know, the proposal right now is to scale back on some of the healthcare benefits and so on, but the -- what the president can do is exempt -- what the -- as Ben was saying, what you have is what the Pentagon calls a \"haircut,\" everything get\\'s cut. And I think one thing we all agree on is this is a foolish way to run things.', \"We are being confronted by some strategic choices, to use Ben's term.  There are three agents of the world that we rely on for trade and for resources.  We're part of the global economy. And we rely on the global common space, cyber space, the sea, and the undersea to link us to those parts of the world.  In the Far East, the Chinese, for over a decade now, have been building up their military capabilities to try and push us out of the region.  Just listen to what the Japanese, the Taiwanese, the Koreans, and so on are saying.  We have a strategic choice.  Now, it's not going to be a big army that we respond with.  But we're going to have to do something to maintain stability in that region, lest we encourage Chinese adventurism.  And you could see it in the paper, in terms of the trends in Chinese behavior.  Iran -- a nuclear armed Iran.  Do you think they're more or less likely to support Hezbollah, or to support Assad in Syria, or to try and undermine the Gulf monarchies, and disrupt the flow of energy?  Pakistan -- and again, you know, I dont want to go on at length.  But you look at cyber situation.  Concerns that even non-state entities will be able to inflict serious damage on us by cyber attacks.\", 'I would -- well, I would just say that --', \"-- take the Far East example.  The purpose of trying to maintain a stable military balance in the region and address the capabilities that the Chinese are building up -- the purpose is to avoid war, not to fight war.  You can get into a war because of the perception that you're too weak to defend yourselves or that you're irresolute.  And cutting a trillion dollars additionally out of defense over the next decade certainly, I think, sends that message as we withdraw from parts of the world.\", 'Those of you who recall the Melian Dialogue, and I\\'m not quite old enough to recall that, but the famous phrase is, The strong do what they can; the weak do what they must.\" Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - If you\\'re weak, others will decide your fate.  If you\\'re strong, at least you have the option of being smart or stupid.  And hopefully we elect people who are the former and not the latter.', \"I'm sorry?\", \"Again, getting back to the point we were discussing a little bit earlier -- and Kori kind of set this up.  Chinese are good strategists.  Yeah, we have the world's best Air Force.  But our aircraft in the Far East are concentrated at two bases.  What are the Chinese doing? They're building lots of ballistic missiles to target those bases.  We have the world's best carriers, as Kori mentioned, and a lot of them.  The Chinese are developing missiles to target those carriers and they're building submarines to go after those carriers.  So do we cut the -- you know, do we need a big army for China, to maintain stability in that region?  Hardly. But we are going to figure out -- or going to need to figure out a way to maintain stability in that region.  Otherwise, I don't think the Filipinos are going to say, You know, the Americans are gone.  Let's take on the Chinese.  Now, the Japanese may say, The Americans are gone, we need nuclear weapons.  And let's see what that does to the neighborhood.\", \"There's a saying that hope and wishing is not a strategy.  I would like to think that diplomacy could solve all our problems, we wouldn't need militaries.  Or that the global economy's stupid, if we all just sit down and shut up, we're going to get rich.  Fact of the matter is, in the absence of a stabilizing military force, you tend to get into trouble. Look at the period from 1850 to 1914.  The end of the Napoleonic wars.  Britain emerges as the world's dominant power.  And the Pax Britannica exists for a century, until the time that Britain's power began to wane, they began to cut back on their defenses. They began to expand their social welfare programs, for better or worse.  And Germany decided that they could win a war quickly, that they could defeat the Allies quickly.  And what you ended up with is World War I and carnage on an unparalleled scale.  Again, it wasn't because the British were too strong that Germany decided to go to war.  It was because they thought they had an opportunity to advance their aims at the expense of others.\", 'I just wanted to say --', \"-- again, this is putting the cart before the horse.  To say, Oh, let's cut a trillion dollars out of defense and all of a sudden, everything's going to be efficient, and we're going to stop all this pork barreling -- I mean, again, that is the triumph of hope over experience.\", \"Yeah, I would say -- just let me add something to what Tom said.  The problem isn't necessarily entitlements, per se.  It's the fact that as a people we're not willing to pay for the benefits we vote ourselves.  Entitlements are up around 10 percent of GDP, not 3 percent.  And they -- the slope line is going up dramatically.  And as Robert Rubin said not too long ago, if we don't get a handle, particularly on the medical entitlements, then there's no way we can solve our economic problem.\", \"One way to think about your vote is if Vladimir Putin were here tonight or the senior generals of the PLA or the Ayatollah Khomeini, how would they be voting, do you think? [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 - [applause] The issue we debate here tonight is very real for me.  For 25 years I wore the uniform of a soldier, and in the 1973 Middle East war we were one order short of arming nuclear warheads.  But we were trained.  We were equipped.  We were ready.  Two years later in 1975 I was stationed on a militarized zone in Korea when the North Koreans were digging tunnels underneath us and trying to intercept the resupply ships we were sending out to some of the islands off the coast of South Korea.  But we had confidence in our equipment.  We had well-trained troops.  We weren't looking forward to a scrape but we were ready.  Only two years later, after the results of Watergate and Vietnam and inflation and oil shocks really hit home, I was in a unit where we couldn't train, where our troops were hiding toilet paper because we couldn't get toilet paper for our troops, where some of my best soldiers were leaving the Army because they had no faith that the American people were willing to provide what was necessary for us to be a ready unit. And I say thankfully we were not put to the test.  We recovered, but it was a very expensive proposition in the early 1980s to put Humpty Dumpty back together again after the military was broken.  We were lucky.  I wouldn't want to risk our security or our economic well-being on luck, and certainly not the lives of our young men and women in uniform.  Thank you. [applause]\"]\n",

      "['I had to make important decisions based on imperfect information.', 'The always provocative Peter Huber.', \"Thank you.  To understand why FDA's caution is hazardous to our health, you have to appreciate FDA's growing focus on statistical outcomes over results for patients. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - Fading at FDA is a mindset of clinical medicine and patient care.  And in it is a growing fixation on the statistical results, clinical trials, and a growing rule by math over medicine.  This mindset can be seen in the triage that now hamper clinical trials and drug development.  FDA imposes increasingly onerous experiments to try to ferret out benefits from new drugs.  And FDA reviewers want the results of clinical trials to insulate them from critics; critics who say they're not doing enough about drug safety. But the laborious trials that result come at a very big, human cost.  Higher degrees of statistical certainty under FDA's outdated way of designing drug trials require longer, larger, and increasingly impractical studies, especially when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs.  Some promising therapies simply aren't being developed. Let me tell you one story of how this mindset impacts patients.  Hunter's Syndrome is part of a family of related and extremely rare disorders.  All are inherited.  Each robs children of the ability to produce a crucial enzyme that's used by the body to break down certain sugar molecules found in the blood.  Missing these enzymes, these molecules end up accumulating in places like the liver, and the spleen, and the joints, with often painful and debilitating consequences.  Before treatment came along, parents had to literally sit idly by and watch as these diseases destroyed their children. But by the 1990s, drugs were developed that could function as replacements for the enzymes that were missing in these related disorders.  These disorders were so bad and the drugs were so promising that the first of these medicines, a drug for Gauchers Disease called Ceredase, was approved on the basis of a very simple clinical trial that involved only a dozen patients.  By 2004, FDA had approved enzyme replacements for four other conditions that were each very similar to Hunter's Syndrome. All were lysosomal storage diseases, where kids were born missing one of these crucial and related enzymes.  It was understood that if you could replace the enzyme, these children were likely to derive a therapeutic benefit.  But when an experimental enzyme for Hunter's Syndrome finally came along, a decade after that original drug was approved for Gauchers Disease, FDA's regulatory norms and FDA's regulatory culture had changed dramatically.  In an effort to satisfy an increasingly demanding desire for statistical certainty, the FDA trial imposed extraordinary hardships on the children and their families.  In order to approve the Hunter's drug, called Elaprase, FDA required that the trial enroll 96 patients.  This was fully 20 percent of all the Americans afflicted with the disorder.  And instead of testing the drug for six months, as had been done for every other drug, all of these enzyme replacements, FDA wanted a full year of clinical data, 52 weekly infusions in these kids. FDA also insisted that the kids be randomly assigned to receive either a drug or a placebo.  There was no need to have a placebo in this clinical trial.  The disease follows a Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - very predictable pattern.  And doctors already knew the normal decline these kids would have if they were left untreated.  But leaving some kids untreated was basically leaving them to become disabled.  Yet, including the placebo helped give the trial itself more statistical rigor for FDA. Finally, in past trials, with all these lysosomal storage drugs, these enzyme replacements, drugs targeted to similar diseases, FDA asked companies to measure surrogate markers that the -- the drug was having an impact on disease.  Like the ability to shrink organs, like the liver and the spleen.  That was interpreted as proof that the drug was breaking down the sugar molecules and they weren't becoming deposited there.  And this would mean that the enzyme replacement was working.  By looking at these surrogate measures, which you could measure over a shorter period of time, it was a way to accelerate the development of the drug. But in the case of the Hunter's drug, Elaprase, FDA decided to test the ability of the children to walk and to breathe as the clinical outcome it wanted.  FDA saw this as a more rigorous way to see if the drug was working, but it came with hard trade-offs.  It made the trial much longer than it needed to be.  You had to wait years for the kids to become disabled to see if the drug was having its impact and to measure the result. And it tested the boundaries of what was ethical.  Yet, this story is increasingly the norm when it comes to FDA review culture and it's played out multiple times in recent years, so much so that observers who follow the FDA now believe that the Europeans have become more flexible when it comes to drugs targeted to unmet medical needs than the Americans.  The drug  for bone cancer, the drug Pirfenidone for ideopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the drug Tafamidis for familial amyloidosis, all rejected by FDA in recent years because the statistical results didn't meet the agency's requirements, all approved in Europe, all embraced by European regulators. To understand why FDA's caution is, at times, hazardous, you have to recognize FDA's growing resolve to make sure the trials supporting drug approval meet an arduous but increasingly outdated standard for proving efficacy.  As my debate partner, Peter Huber will show, this outdated model that FDA uses exacerbates these problems by making trials much more inefficient than they should be and allowing us to learn far less from the results than we otherwise can.  Yet surveys of people with life-threatening disorders continue to show that patients want access to promising drugs sooner.  They're willing to tolerate some risk.  They're willing to tolerate the uncertainty.  For patients with unmet medical needs, what kind of FDA do we want; an FDA that advances care, an FDA that gets new science to the patient more quickly?  What we can't have is an FDA that's ruled by statistics over medicine.  We can't have an FDA that focuses on its process rather than advancing patient care. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - Americans deserve a less cautious FDA and an FDA that actively embraces advances in science.  Thank you. [applause]\", 'Right.  Well, I think that the issue really is development times, not review times, as Dr. Avorn talked about.  He was focusing on review times, how long does it take FDA to look at the applications?  Really the issue is how long does it take to develop the drugs. On average, it takes about nine years to develop a drug for endocrine disorders, about six years to develop a drug for cancer.  It has to go through typically three phases of Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - clinical trials.

You're going to put the drug in Phase I in patients who are already sick.  But typically if it's a drug targeted at, let's say, hypertension, you're going to put it in healthy volunteers.  And in Phase I, you're looking mostly at safety, although they're starting to look at issues of efficacy, and you're starting to look at issues of dose.\", \"Phase II, you're looking at proof of concept.  You want to see if the drug works.  You're not necessarily assessing the clinical outcomes in the clinical trial, but you're looking at indication that's the drug is having the activity that you anticipated.\", \"And that's more people.  And depending on the disease you're looking at, it's anywhere from -- it could be a couple of hundred in a cancer trial to, you know, 5,000 in a primary care drug.\", \"Phase III is the pivotal trial.  It's the registration trial.  Depending on the disease you're looking at, it could be a couple of thousand patients in a cancer trial at a cost of about $100,000 per patient enrolled in the trial.

And there, you're looking for statistically rigorous evidence that the drug has a clinical effect on the desired outcome.\", \"But you can't --\", \"There is no question that FDA should have authority after these drugs are approved through trials that try to accelerate the development to continue the studies and then collect information.  But when we're dealing with unmet medical needs, life-threatening disorders, patient want access to these drugs sooner.  And you talked just about review times. But the real issue here is development times.  And they've been going up.  And they've been going up because the trials that FDA's mandating on drug developers are more and more rigorous.  They're larger and larger trials.  You're talking about trials that used to be two or 3,000 patients -- now are 10- or 20,000 patients.\", \"Because the FDA is wedded to an old model of statistics.

And I'm saying you're not going to ferret out those kinds of challenges.  I mean, some of the challenges you're talking, maybe you would.  But many of them, you wouldn't. I'll give you another anecdote.  The minimally invasive aortic valve, right now, before a year ago, to have your aortic valve repaired when it became brittle, you had to have open heart surgery. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 - If you went to Europe, you could get a catheter to insert a new valve through a minimally invasive procedure, much like a cardiac catheterization.  30,000 Europeans had that valve implanted in them before it was approved here in the United States.  It took us four years since it was approved in Europe to finally approve it here.  And FDA was requiring companies to put it in pigs and sheep when there were thousands of Europeans walking around with it in their chest.  Now, you explain to me why we couldn't learn more from those Europeans and the clinical data that was generated there than we're going to learn from pigs and sheep.  And another answer --\", 'But on devices, they are.  I mean, devices are different.  They are getting access to devices before the United States.

And development times are guided by the clinical trials that companies are forced to do.  And the clinical trials that companies are forced to do are determined by what the FDA asks for because this is the biggest market. You can't develop a drug just for the European market.  So if the FDA says that they want that outrageous Phase III clinical trial that's going to take five years, the companies do it.  And so the drug isn't available here or Europe.\", \"Review time is the amount of time that it takes FDA to actually review the application once it's submitted to the agency.

And I don't want to misquote your book, but I think you expressed that, too, in your book, that you don't fully trust doctors.  And so the problem is that Dr. Avorn and the FDA is unwilling to approve drugs for narrow circumstances because they don't trust that physicians are just going to use that drug based on where the data indicates that it's going to have its most beneficial impact.  That's a very difficult problem to try to solve from a central agency in Washington.  And that is at the root of a lot of these issues that we're talking about here.  I think we should put it on the table.\", 'Well, I --', \"-- read Dr. Avorn's book.  And again, if I misquote you, let me know. I don't think that you trust drug companies in that book.  You express a mistrust of drug companies.  I know you don't trust physicians to make nuanced prescribing decisions based on the label information.  I don't think you think that patients can make fully informed decisions, because the information is too hard to interpret.  You don't trust FDA, but you want to give them more authority.  So my question is, who do you trust? [laughter]  [applause]\", \"And we're not arguing for no FDA.  We're -- what the question is -- [applause] -- what should the level of evidence be?

Yondelis is a -- I don't want to be an advertiser for the drug company -- a lot of people think it's a very good drug for sarcoma, where there's no available for therapy.  What's the harm in making it available here?  Watching it closely, allowing doctors who treat that disease -- it's just a small community of physicians who treat that disease -- to use it.  I agree with you that there should be vigilant post-market follow-up; FDA has tools to do that.  They can be holding the drug companies accountable, and should be.  But what's the harm in making it available?  Trusting physicians to use it appropriately?  Some won't, many will.  Trusting patients to make informed judgments.  Some won't, many will.\", \"Yeah.  I think we need to think about -- you're talking about the drugs that, you know, you don't see a whole plethora of drugs that just aren't available after they've been developed.  I think we need to also think about the drugs that never get developed.  I'll give you an example.  Polycystic kidney disease: basically, it's an inherited disorder where you build up cysts in your kidneys and eventually go on to have total renal failure. You're very familiar with it.  FDA says that in order to demonstrate efficacy for a drug for polycystic kidney disease, you have to see how many patients go on to have renal failure versus, let's say, a placebo, instead of looking at cyst formation. But the problem is it takes 30 years to develop renal failure as a result of polycystic kidney disease.  If you could use a reduction in cyst formation as the endpoint in the trial and show that a new drug reduces the formation of cysts, it seems intuitive, you're not going to progress as quickly to renal failure.  But they want you to look for the out -- the clinical outcome, renal failure.  And guess what?  Companies have walked away from developing drugs for polycystic kidney disease.  So those drugs just are simply aren't being developed.  And that's what I worry most about.  It's not the drugs that are getting licensed in Europe and not here.  It's the ones that simply aren't being developed.\", 'The question presupposes --', \"The question presupposes that we actually know a lot about the drugs that go through the full-blown clinical trials versus the ones that go through the accelerated approval. And I would say that we don't.  There's a lot that we don't know.  And to pick on -- to Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 - pick up on your field, what do you think would happen if we randomized every NSAID on the market to placebo and did a ten-year cardiovascular outcome study?  Do you think that some of those NSAIDs would show the same cardiovascular risk that was shown with the Vioxx which Dr. Avorn talked about?  I suspect that they would.  We don't know about the latent cardiovascular risks with most of the drugs on the market because we haven't looked for it, and we never will because it's impractical and impossible to do that study.  So the advice I give patients, and take myself, is if I'm taking a drug, I make sure I really need it.\", \"Well, look, there's a lot of federal --\", \"Is it accurate, what, that the FDA's captured by the industry because the user fees help fund --\", \"No, it's not accurate.  I mean, there's a long precedent of user fees being used to help offset the costs of government agencies, state agencies, federal agencies, other models for it in the federal government.  You're paying, really, for the review times, the review process.  You're not paying for the outcome.  And I think that there is something to be said for the industry that's regulated sitting down periodically with the agency that regulates it to talk about how that process is working and to help talk about how funds can be provided to improve how that process is working.  There is -- this actually works. And if you look back at the original PDUFA  legislation, written into that legislation was language from Congress describing to FDA how to hold a meeting.  Now, I would say FDA's management, and the management of the drug review process, is a whole lot better today as a result of the user fees.  And they don't need instructions from Congress anymore on how to hold a meeting.  But that's the way it was back then.  And the user fees are a big reason that the management of that agency has improved so much.\", \"I'll tell you --\", \"-- you never think about it.  I mean, I worked in the agency for a number of years, and the fact that the agency was partially funded through user fees -- it's effectively become a tax.  It's not a user fee anymore.  The industry knows they're going to have to pay it. They're not going to be able to withdraw it.  It's not even a thought.\", \"You know, I think the issue is about caution and risk.  And embracing these new kinds of technologies takes a certain degree of risk.  And it takes people at the agency outside that comfort zone.  And where I think we're arguing is that the agency is just not willing to embrace the risk; they're wedded to a very old model of doing things. And they haven't moved out of their comfort zone.  Sure, they have pilot programs.  I started the Critical Path Initiative with Dr. McClellen.  But they haven't progressed, because ultimately, the leadership can talk about these ideas and does, but when it filters down to the review level, the reviewers ultimately feel uncomfortable moving outside the established models and taking the risk that it would take to adopt those kinds of innovations.\", 'You can change the culture, but you have change the structure of the process.', 'That -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 -', \"I want to come back to that drug for Hunter's Disease, Elaprase, I talked about at the outset.  When that data from that study were released, the results were impressive. Patients getting the drug could walk 44 meters farther in five minutes than before getting the drug.  By comparison, most of the children on the sugar pills showed no improvement and many saw their condition worsen.  Science Daily, at the time, relayed the experience of 16-year-old Cody Paxton, one of the first patients enrolled in the trial. And he said, quote, My breathing is better and I'm more energetic, unquote.  And he said he could put his hand behind his back, which he couldn't do before receiving Elaprase.  Most of the patients forced to take that placebo, however, saw their joint disease worsen and advance, making future treatment much more difficult. I'd like to say that the kids who got the placebo would regain all the function they lost during that trial, but many would not.  I'd like to say that companies are still developing drugs for these enzyme disorders, but no new companies have entered this space since that time.  And only one subsequent drug has been approved for any of these diseases. And I'd like to say that the FDA reviewer in charge of imposing the Elaprase trial isn't handling drug reviews anymore, but he's actually been promoted and now sets drug review policy for the entire FDA. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 54 - FDA reviewers are not oblivious to the human cost that we talked about here tonight. But the culture they operate under isn't suited well to minimizing them.  By implementing a few key reforms, some of which we've talked about tonight, and modernizing the science of regulation, FDA could modernize its culture and improve its ability to keep Americans both healthy and safe. [applause]\"]\n",
      "[\"Well, mostly, I'm just hoping to overcome my intellectual attention deficit disorder.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - Well, in case you didn't know, our side actually won the first round of this debate in 19 -- no, in 1992, when we persuaded the FDA to adopt what is called the accelerated approval rule.  Now, I must confess that the rule has been applied not very widely, but in two particular areas and not with whole-hearted enthusiasm, especially of late.  But I intend to persuade you that this rule is, in fact, the only place that FDA today for we are actually making use of the very best, modern pharmacological science that we have. It is in fact the protocols that the FDA uses much more often, the un-accelerated approval, if you will, where we are actively obstructing the use of those technologies and is, therefore, in the standard protocols that the FDA has been using for a very long time that the FDA is actually hazardous to your health. Let me begin by giving you some brief context and a description of where this rule has been applied.  Go back to 1988, a couple of biochemists from the United States and one British win a Nobel prize for their mastering of what is called a structure-based design. And this is one of the two processes that they've been using ever since to design, precisely, targeted drugs that can hone in on a molecule that is associated with some disease.  This is some years after HIV arrived in town.  And they quickly developed several drugs that can target different parts of HIV's chemistry, which, until very close to that time, had been completely incurable. The FDA licenses these drugs at absolutely record speed, applying its accelerated approval rule.  And it soon becomes apparent that not one of them is going to be any good; not for long, not on its own.  Because the virus mutates so fast that you throw any single drug at it and it very quickly develops a resistance to it.  You just can't beat it with one drug.  But doctors at this point, because the drug's been licensed, are now free to work things out on their own.  And they very quickly began assembling these drugs in cocktails and that does the trick. The other -- the second area where the rule has actually been applied quite aggressively for the last 20 years, is oncology.  And it's -- here's a brief picture of the kind of medicine that has emerged in that area.  There are at least 10 biochemically distinct breast cancers out there.  It's not one disease.  We treat some of them with estrogen blockers. We treat others with estrogen itself.  Okay.  One of the estrogen blockers performs well only if you have the right liver.  It depends -- it has to be metabolized by your liver. You know, some patients have the right liver, others don't.  There are at least two other major receptors and two classes of drugs in breast cancers.  And you mix them all up in various ways to try and beat the disease in the individual patient.  We're finding similar levels of complexity and diversity in almost all of the major intractable diseases we're facing now: the neurological, the autoimmune diseases, and indeed, in many very Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - common diseases like diabetes; they just aren't going to be beaten with one size fits all drugs.  The underlying chemistry isn't going to allow it, which is bad news for the FDA, because the FDA's standard protocols are actually pretty good at getting licensing one size fits all drugs.  But they are worse than useless, it turns out, when they encounter complexity.  Using accelerated approval, the FDA can, in fact, handle complexity reasonably well.  And it's going to do it even better. In your book, Dr. -- I'd surmise you'd not like this rule at all.  You attribute its origins to AIDS activists who terrified the agency with a massive sit-in. Here's another view.  The rule has allowed for the development of pioneering and lifesaving HIV and cancer drugs over the past two decades.  That quotes from President Obama's Council of Scientific Advisers in a report issued last September; and the report recommends that the FDA use accelerated approval much more systematically and broadly for all drugs that address an unmet need in treating a serious illness. Notice -- this is why we have one lawyer for three doctors.  Notice that the report did not endorse accelerated approval because it got drugs to patients sooner.  It said that the rule allowed for the development of those pioneering drugs.  But for the rule, we probably wouldn't have many of those drugs at all, which means that the benefits of that rule have absolutely dwarfed anything that our opponents here can possibly tell you about the rare side effects that might have been missed when that rule was applied. HIV has killed an average of about 20,000 Americans a year in the 30 years since it's surfaced in the United States. The numbers would have been horrendously worse if for the last 20 years we didn't have some good treatments for the disease in the place.  We owe 40 cancer drugs and 15 new treatments to accelerated approval.  They have given years of additional life to many patients.  There is no story about safety and side effects that can possibly approach those numbers. So this magic rule doesn't just get us the drugs we need licensed faster.  It gets them licensed when the other -- the FDA's other rules, the slow rules, just won't license them at all.  How?  In brief, it -- what it does is it loosens the FDA's grip on -- throttling grip on the process just enough to let doctors get involved and work out the really good drug science using the very best tools available.  I want to briefly take the time to tell you how this is working, because, you know, it's not really that complicated and you can make your own judgments about how whether it makes sense. First of all, ordinarily, the FDA won't license a drug until it sees clinical symptoms. Accelerated approval will let you license a drug based on, say, its ability to lower HIV loads in the patients' blood. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - And by the way, it works in only one in 10 patients.  The FDA can still license it.  It'll make an ad hoc: Oh, gee, that looks promising.  We want it.  Okay?  Under accelerated approval, therefore, the drug gets licensed much sooner.  But it also gets licensed on a very different kind of evidence.  The White House report makes clear that this is exactly what we should do.  We should start with the premise that when we have a new drug, it may well be only one piece of a solution that's giving only partial benefits to a minority of patients involved in the -- you're sort of enlisted in the drug trial. The FDA standard protocols allow nothing of the sort.  Under the current application of the rule, the FDA, again, in a very ad hoc way, says the drug company -- says to the drug company implicitly and doctors explicitly, Look, work out the stuff -- the rest, you know, once you got the drug out there, as they did with HIV.  The White House report would systematize it.  You know, you would gather torrents of information during the trials.  And you would -- and you would use those to work out a drug -- molecular information. You'd use those to work out how the patients are doing and why some are faring well on the drug and others aren't.  That kind of screening of patients and active rearranging the trial as it progresses is anathema under the standard FDA protocols.  You're not allowed to do it at all. When you do it, you actually get to precision molecular medicine.  You work out how a drug can be precisely prescribed to patients and used just right.  The FDA is frozen in the headlights.  It can't deal with these torrents.  It has no experience with them.  You need big computers to do it.  It is hazardous to your health because it can't use the science. Thank you.\", 'I -- forgive me, but --', \"-- this just isn't an accurate description.  And first of all, fast-track is a quite different term used by FDA.  It is not the accelerated approval.  You know, call it whatever you like, but they are different things. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -\", \"On the accelerated -- look, but this is absolutely unequivocal.  Under the accelerated approval rule, you cut off a big chunk of what the FDA's normal rules do.  You actually cut off in the middle of Phase III or Phase II.

And who does it, then?  Because you still have to finish.  And the answer is, you do it -- by and large, you do it in Phase IV.  And a lot of doctors out there are now also using the drug.

They're finding the biomarkers on efficacy and safety.  These are all emerging later.  They are getting the precision medicine.  And nowhere else in the FDA protocols you get that.

The whole notion that you convene a group of patients of a certain size, and you test them for a certain time, and then you make a declaration of a drug is a pure artifice of the kinds of the statistics that the FDA uses in its conventional protocols.  It's the frequentest trial.  If you -- forgive the jargon -- the alternative I've been discussing is typically called Bayesian trials. And those are completely open-ended.  No serious Bayesian says we will stop after certain time and a certain number of patients.  You keep feeding the data into the system forever and you keep refining forever.

True story:  Six-year-old Emily Whitehead was on -- you may have read this in the Times. You know, was on the brink of death after a two-year battle with leukemia.  Her doctors extracted from some of her cancerous cells some signature molecules and moved them into some of her healthy immune system cells. Exactly as planned, they went in a -- into a wild attack on their cancerous siblings, so wild that they overproduced a molecular -- an immune system signaling molecule, a cytokine.  One of her doctors knew that an arthritis drug, of all things, controls cytokines.  He prescribed a massive dose.  Emily -- the ICU staff gathered to sing happy birthday when Emily awoke from her coma on the day she turned seven.  The Times ran her story just before Christmas, and Emily is healthy to this day, and cancer free. We should be simply appalled, you know, that, you know, intense molecular tracking and learning on the fly and measuring everything you possibly can in sight during clinical trials isn't an -- I mean, isn't just the norm today rather than an exception you have to go through to -- a special rule to even find. What are we thinking when we tell the doctors, you know, to put on blindfolds and do no adaptation, no significant learning during the trials?

But we had one other influence in my family, which was my grandfather and his father, immigrants, lower east side, a Jewish kid trying to make it in the city.  We had the attitude, the think Yiddish act British attitude, \"We\\'ll fit in.\"  We had the dream of making it in the city which meant making it in this neighborhood where we\\'re standing, in the upper west side, the Upper East Side. And that was the -- how the Republican Party was started.  It was started by Abraham Lincoln, a poor boy in Illinois who wanted to make it.  And he did it when he was in the state legislature, using government to give poor boys and girls the power to make it and achieve social mobility.  He created it by creating a state bank to invest, building canals and railroads.  He got to the presidency, created railroad legislation, Homestead Act, Land-Grant College Act, even introduced the income tax.  It was using government to give poor boys and girls a chance to succeed.  And that was still around when I got there, when I got to Washington.  Ronald Reagan, a much more pragmatic and flexible person than is now portrayed by many people on the right, it was about using government in limited but energetic ways to give poor people a chance to succeed. Reagan did it.  Is the Republican Party doing it now?  I think they have not because they\\'ve been so hostile to government.  Ronald Reagan was more pragmatic than the current Republican Party. It\\'s also no longer 1980.  Now if you want to rise and succeed, it\\'s not enough just to work hard and row a boat across the Ohio River like Lincoln.  Think of a poor girl who wants to be like Lincoln today.  She can\\'t just work hard ferrying people across that river.  She grows up probably without a father.  She grows up in a chaotic community with low social trust, high economic pressure, few community bonds.  To succeed, she\\'s probably going to need some language instruction.  She\\'s probably going to need some early -- some protection from early childhood distresses that\\'ll destroy her self-control. She\\'s going to need institutions that\\'ll help her build relationships so she can use people as tools for learning throughout life.  She\\'s probably going to have to spend 21 years in education to qualify for a middle class job.  And so what does the Republican Party today have to say to her?  Almost nothing.  This party is encased in a simplistic and archaic metric, government versus the market.  Government bad, the market good. If you\\'re an energy executive or chemical executive, maybe the government is your central pain.  If you\\'re that little girl, the government is not your big problem.  If you\\'re that little girl, the government, through Pell grants is sometimes the solution at helping you work hard and becoming a better capitalist.  Does the Republican Party offer Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - anything?  No, which is why Asian Americans, for example, voted against the Republican Party three times to one.  The Republican Party has become so hostile to government that they find it very hard to have anything positive to offer.  So hostile to government they can\\'t really stand for social mobility, the cause they started with.  And so this is a party that has lost the essence of having a positive agenda even in the cause that was its founding principle.  And the country knows that.  Republicans have lost five out of the last six popular votes in the elections.  They\\'ve lost the Senate.  They should have won. They held onto the House by force of redistricting.  The Republican party has a 33 percent overall approval rating when the Democrats have 47 percent.  You take every rising group in America.  The Republican Party is losing that group.  Latinos, by 4 to 1. Asian Americans, by 3 to 1.  African Americans, by 9 to 1.  People in single households by 2 to 1.  They\\'re getting slaughtered among young people.  If this electorate, and the electorate of the 20th century, was made up of 85-year-old men -- white men, the party would be doing awesome. [laughter] This party is not that party.  This party sometimes looks like the receding roar of a white America that\\'s never coming back and has to move to recapture that.  It has -- and what is the people\\'s top criticism of the Republican Party?  Recent Gallup poll this week, the top criticism is they do not compromise.  So this is a party going down the drain.  It\\'s a party that\\'s unwilling to compromise on budgets, unwilling to compromise on guns, apparently unwilling to compromise on immigration. Bob Bennett of Utah, a very conservative guy, thrown out of the Senate for working with a Democrat.  I had lunch with the fourth most conservative member of the Senate - - terrified of getting primaried from the right.  Unwilling to have any flexibility. Becoming an uncompromising party.  To me, this is a party that has to tackle two big issues.  The first issue is the welfare state, which is making us unsustainable.  The second issue is that little girl and the social immobility, the social segmentation that Charles Murray writes about.  And my advice to the Republican Party: don\\'t move to the center for the sake of moving to the center.  The center is nothing.  Move to the center for the sake of that little girl, which is your founding principle, which is social mobility. Do right by that little girl and you\\'ll do right by yourself politically.  And that means having a positive agenda.  It means being more flexible.  It means being prudent and sensible, not a party of a red rump of America. And so, I don\\'t necessarily want to call the party to the center just for centrism.  But I want to call them back to their essence as a party.  And so, I ask you to vote for the proposition.

He included the biggest tax hike in American history to that point. Reagan signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act, which was one of the bigger liberalizations of abortion laws.  That didn't make him a moderate.  It made him someone who was practical politician.  And he fought for what he could and tried to get things done, but he was willing to address real problems and not govern on the basis of a prefab ideology.\", 'No.  But he was someone who was willing to govern.', \"Right.  So, well, maybe two ways.  Ronald Reagan adjusted to the problems of his day. In the late 1970s, there was a stagflation.  There was a global shift of overregulation. There was a global shift of government which really did stagnate the country. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 - And Ronald Reagan, I think, responded very intelligently, along with Margaret Thatcher, to the problems of those days.  The problem is the problem of 2013, it's not 1980, and the problems are different.  And if you stay with some mythical, pure Reaganism, which includes no tax increases ever, small government all the way, which is mythical, then you are not responding to the problems of today.\", \"Okay.

If he had consulted -- if they had asked him before they raised the hand question, he would have given that good advice of how to dodge it.  But they didn't just dodge that.  They didn't just answer that question.  They raised their hand, and then they defended it for the rest of the campaign.  They defended the position that $10 in spending was not worth $1 in tax increases.  They support that.  They believe in that, they talked about it.  It was a perfect example of the sort of absolutist position; a position of preference that a lot of us have that taxes shouldn't go up turned into an absolute fetish.  And as a result, this party is incapable of reaching a budget deal.  Now, I don't support all the budget deals that were out there, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 - but a couple years ago, they were given a budget deal of $3 to one, $3 of spending cuts to $1 of tax increase. That, to me, was the no-brainer of the century.  Take that deal.  They didn't take the deal.  They lost the election.  Now we're down to maybe one to one.  This is a party that's incapable of getting to yes.\", \"I'll go.  Ralph -- I think Ralph or Laura, I can't remember which, mentioned how the Republican party has collapsed in California.  And apparently it was because of the mushy moderate policies of Pete Wilson and others.  What I don't remember is Pete Wilson proposing a restrictionist immigration reform and destroying the Republican Partys chances among Latino voters in California.  And that's what destroyed the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 57 - Republican Party in California.  I sit here this week, and I watch the Republican Party learning from the lesson of California and trying to do the same thing nationally. And I think that's about to happen to --\", \"We've had a lot of politics and some references to the dictionary tonight.  Ralph has his [unintelligible].  Laura has her animus to George Bush.  I want to go back to the little girl I mentioned.  I want to go back to the high-tech entrepreneurs looking for a worker.  I want to go back to the young person saddled with debt, the gay or lesbian person in a relationship who wants to solidify that relationship within the covenant of marriage. The party that doesn't serve the people is going to die.  The party that doesn't serve the contemporary problems of the age is going to die.  Those are some of the people who have to be served by a party in order for it to survive.  I'm a conservative.  I have some doubts.  I have a lot of skepticism about government.  But you have to use government in limited and energetic ways to serve those people that I've mentioned.  You have to be willing to compromise to get a budget deal so the young person is not saddled with millions of dollars of debt. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 59 - You have to be able to work for a comprehensive immigration reform so that the high- tech worker can get a job, so the young people living in the shadows have some chance of dignity in their lives.  You have to be willing to use government in limited but energetic ways to re-weave the social fabric so the young girl living a few miles from here can grow up in a neighborhood that's orderly, so that people can have jobs with earnable wages, so that people have an incentive to marry, some of them men who are now drifting through society.  And that takes more government than I would have thought 10 years ago.  But that is the problem that's out there.  And that's the problem we have to deal with.  So, I may have moved more toward the center since I worked at the Wall Street Journal editorial page or the National Review.  But I think I've done it because the problems have changed.  And some of those problems demand a little more government action.  And if you're stuck, unwilling to use government in any of those problems, then your party will die.\"]\n",
      "[\"Are you kidding?  I wouldn't get 5 percent of the vote.\", \"John, thank you. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - [applause] Mickey Edwards: Well, it's a great privilege to be able to be here at Intelligence Squared.  Thank you very much for doing this.  It's great to be here with my friend, David Brooks, and also to be here with my friends Laura Ingraham and Ralph Reed who have devoted so much of their lives to fighting for principles they believe in.  And I admire them both.  I hope they lose badly, but I admire them both.  I think the question here tonight is -- to put it even more bluntly: do the positions that they are speaking in behalf of serve this country well? And if they do not, if they do not stand for where America is and where America is going, what claim can they make for support from the American people who find a party that is increasingly at odds with the new, more tolerant, more diverse population that is going to elect America's political leaders for years to come?  The fact is, Ralph, this is not the country of 1964 that the party recovered from.  It's going to be much harder to recover in a society that looks like the one we have become.  Let me be clear.  I do not think the problem is that the Republican Party is conservative.  The problem is that what it advocates -- what they advocate very sincerely is not at all consistent with what American conservatives have traditionally stood for, certainly not in the days of Ronald Reagan, who almost definitely could not win a Republican primary today. It's not consistent with the days when the Republican Party stood for things like prudence and responsibility and they did not attempt to dictate to the people how they were supposed to live and what their values were supposed to be.  I spent a good many years championing the Republican Party and conservatism.  Among the other things, besides chairing the American Conservative Union and the Conservative Political Action Conference, I chaired Ronald Reagan's 1980 policy task forces for his election.  And I have watched this country change, and I have watched the Republican Party also change in the opposite direction.  Americans still agree with conservative principles. They defend the right of citizens to own guns.  But they don't applaud a party that supports people being able to carry loaded guns across state lines and into restaurants and schools and churches.  The people support conservatism, but they don't support a political party that can't refrain from carrying every sound and defensible principle to its unacceptable extremes.  You know, Ralph quoted people like Bobby Jindal, who has been giving speeches saying that what you're advocating will destroy the Republican Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - Party.  The people will support a political party that wants a smaller deficit and lower taxes and small government, but they're not going to support a party that draws the line, and when they're offered a chance to have lower taxes and smaller government, they say, No, we're unwilling to compromise, accept any kind of a tax increase, who are willing to say that compromise is bad, compromise is evil. You know, I'll tell you, compromise is what makes a nation of 300 million people work. And without compromise, drawing a line in the sand, you can't make it. [applause] Real conservatives support free enterprise and small business but not giant corporations with giant tax loopholes.  And yet today's Republican Party would fight to the death to protect every single tax advantage of the wealthy, so they leave it to the middle class to pay for the wars and the roads and keeping the drinking water safe.  So we have two questions, and one of them goes directly to a point that Ralph made.  What does it mean to move to the center?  I would not suggest that moving to the center means finding some precise magical spot on the 50-yard line of public opinion, but engaging in a rational politics that is within the range of reasonable and thoughtful discourse, a politics that stands for principle, as Ralph and Laura do, but also stands for the principle that self-government, government of the people, works. And in a nation of 300 million people, that means not just drawing a line in the sand, but fighting for what you believe, make your case, argue for it, get as much as you can and then find the common ground so that we can move together as one people, as one America.  That's what the American people don't see. [applause] That's what the American people do not see in today's Republican Party.  So people are fleeing from the political parties largely because of the dysfunction in Washington that traces back in large part to the kinds of people the Republican Party attracts and nominates for office.  Will it doom the Republican Party?  You saw Barack Obama with his numbers down and the economy in a mess get reelected.  Laura has written that it's Mitt Romney's fault.  Why did Mitt Romney do things that alienated the people?  It's the only way you can win a Republican primary today, is to say the kinds of things that he did. [applause] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - So the -- and in terms of the other things, the nonpresidential races, we had this great chance in the Republican Party to win control of the Senate.  Everybody thought we would win control.  Democrats were going to lose control of the Senate.  In fact, they gained seats.  Why did they gain seats?  Because Republicans put up candidates that allowed Democrats to win the Senate seats in Delaware, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana, who -- those were states where people were inclined to think good of Republicans, but they just could not go there.  So the other question is what it means to be a political party. And it's not just about catering to whatever part of the population one agrees with, but being a serious contributor to the governance of America.  So what's really at stake here are two things:  Whether a hardcore, unyielding, uncompromising Republican Party can survive, and second, whether it should. The Republican Party must come back to the conversation, to the deliberation, to the search for common ground, to that broad range that makes up the rational center, or it, my party, will disappear, and it should.  Please vote for the proposition. [applause]\", \"You know, it's not about the party standing for itself.  It's about the party standing for the country.  You know -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - [applause] -- James Madison is my hero.  I love Madison, the champion of limited government.  But he was also for government.  The Constitution was not just to put constraints on government but to empower government to act in a reasonable, rational way as a nation.  This is not a collection of disparate ideas.  This is a full-fledged nation of people who must come together if they're going to do anything worthwhile.  Government doesn't have all the power. Government doesn't have all the responsibility, but government does have some responsibility.  And that's where the Republican Party is copping out.\", \"You know, I feel like I'm watching one of those games where you try to see which shell the pea is under.  So, I mean, you guys keep talking about the definitional problem, we're not defining the issue right, and yet you keep redefining conservatism.  I mean, Ralph, I appreciate the fact that you pointed out that when I was running for Congress, and when I was there, I routinely carried the African-American vote by good margins. But, you know, a very interesting thing happened. There was a political scientist who did a study of me.  I can't imagine why he would do that, but he looked -- and he compared my voting record with what it would be today. And he said, Holding things steady -- when I was in Congress, you're absolutely right.  I was one of the most conservative members of Congress.  And if I were in Congress today, voting exactly the same way on exactly the same issues, I would be one of the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - most liberal Republicans in Congress.  It's the party that has changed.  That's not the party of Reagan.  It's not the party of Barry Goldwater.  You know, it's -- this is a party that has become something different and unrecognizable, something that is at war with the American people, that's at war with people's rights --\", '-- to make their own choices.', 'Marco Rubio.', 'Where is Marco Rubio ---', '-- on immigration?  I mean --', \"I agree with you on those points.  But those people don't agree with you.\", 'Well, I would love to cede to David, but let me just make this one point.  I mean, this is -- it\\'s not about Marco Rubio.  What happened with Marco Rubio was he got elected, and he became a member of the United States Senate, and he said, \"I\\'ve taken an oath of office for the Constitution, and my job is to help govern America.\"  It\\'s -- you know, it can\\'t be that everything is a matter of principle.  It --', '-- cannot be that you never compromise on anything, you know?  And that\\'s the reputation the Republican Party is getting, the party of \"No.\"  You don\\'t say, \"No,\" to America.  You say, \"I\\'ve taken an oath of office.  I\\'m a member of government.  I have to try to make something happen.\"  And that\\'s what Marco Rubio has done. [applause]', \"Yeah, I have some thoughts here, but I kind of got stunned here by this definition of liberty.  So in the case of the civil rights and you cannot deny African-Americans, obviously you shouldn't, these rights, you know, that's a good thing.  But denying gays rights, that's different, right? [applause] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 - So, I mean, theres a point where you're not being consistent, are you for liberty, or are you for restrictions on liberty?  Are you for a workable government, or are you against it? Are you for limited government or not?  I mean, you're on every side of everything. That doesn't work.\", 'You know, I -- first of all, yes, but here\\'s -- I mean, I agree with a lot of what Ralph said about the positions that he was advocating.  You know, those are conservative.  But I -- we used to call -- people used to call the Republican Party the \"dumb party,\" and I tried to think, \"Why is that?  Why is it the dumb party?\"  So what happens when you have good ideas like the ones you just talked about, and you have the president of the other party and the Senate of the other party, and you want to advance toward what you say, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 - but if they say, \"Okay, let\\'s find a compromise,\" you say, \"No,\" and, therefore, you get nothing, instead of moving in the direction you\\'re advocating, you get nothing.  That\\'s dumb.  That\\'s really dumb, and that\\'s the reputation the Republican Party is getting. [applause]', \"I just wanted to respond to the point in the gentleman's question.  What shows you where the Republican Party is, it is -- you mentioned the primaries.  It's the primary system where the Republican activist, the true believers, people like you show up.  And what happens is you end up with nominees like Christine O'Donnell and Sharon Engel and Richard Murdoch and Denny Rehberg.  That's what has to come out of a Republican primary, and that's what's killing the party.  It's not some magical moderate or not moderate. It's that the Republican Party continues to put, on the ballot as its champions saying, This is what we believe, people who are so far out of the acceptable mainstream that people just can't accept it.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 53 - I wasn't going to make a point.

Believe me, the environmental threat today is more than 1 percent possible.  And I think it's an obligation of the Republican Party, of conservatives, to recognize that if you're going to fight against things that might do harm, might do danger, you know, that one of the things you have to look at is what's happening in the environment and what you need to do to secure our safety in that regard, too.\", \"Well, I don't -- I mean, should I quote Senator Inhofe that -- I don't want to say deniers, but they're deniers. [laughter]\", \"I should support the other side so that Laura will buy the margaritas. [laughter] Look, there's just one simple question on the table.  It's not whether Ralph and Laura are good people, which they are, who believe strongly in their positions or whether those positions are defensible.  I'm a conservative, too.  I agree with a lot of the positions they've taken.  But it's whether or not they are positions that can gain in total the support of a very diverse nation. The Republican Party we have today could disappear and be replaced by a range of its little subsets, all these other -- a Christian right party, a libertarian party, a no government, no tax party, a gun owner's party, a no gays and no immigrants party, each one with its own small niche of true believers, but America would no longer be a single nation of people standing together, and for the purposes of this discussion, then you will have lost.  The Republican Party that once served as a viable noble alternative, a serious part of the national conversation will be, like the Federalists, the Whigs, and the know-nothings, irrelevant and disappeared.  That is not an end that we should embrace, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 61 - but as long as the Republican Party remains a coalition of extremes outside the broad range of reasonable discourse, that's precisely what will happen.  We political people are kind of self-referential; we like to think of ourselves as thinking it's all about us, but it's not about us alone. It's not about just what we think.  This is a big diverse nation, and a political party that gets smaller and narrower as the country gets larger and broader is a party that is doomed.\"]\n",

      "['James Dorn:', 'Russell Roberts:']\n",
      "['Well, I work in the Cato Institute, so that puts me at the opposite end of the spectrum.  I think the minimum wage is zombie economics.', 'My partner is the great rapper Russell Roberts. [laughter] ', \"Good evening.  It's a pleasure to be here.  I hope you will keep an open mind and vote for abolishing the minimum wage.  Jared gave some evidence -- there was just a new study out by David Neumark, written for the NBER, National Bureau of Economic Research, one of the foremost research organizations in the United States, with top scholars.  He refutes much of what Jared just said.  Actually, the preponderance of evidence is in favor of the fact that the minimum wage does destroy jobs.  Why? Because if anybody believes in the law of demand, it means when prices go up, there's less of it that people buy.  And nobody's ever disproven the law of demand, not even Jared. Nobody in Congress has disproven the law of demand.  So, I think we should keep that in mind. Hong Kong never had a minimum wage.  I've been over -- I've been visiting China since 1988, every year, just about.  Hong Kong started to develop in trade in 1938 and it was just a bunch of shanties and everything.  Hong Kong rose up to be one of the most prosperous places in the world without a minimum wage.  So the minimum wage is neither necessary nor sufficient for prosperity; what prosperity requires is opportunities.  The minimum wage destroys opportunities.  I had a friend of mine, his mother was working at a department store up in New Hampshire.  After the kids grew up, she was making close to the minimum wage.  The minimum wage went up, she lost her job.  She enjoyed this job; it changed her whole life.  And she was denied the opportunity to go back and offer her labor services at the pre-minimum wage; that is, the wage that she was agreeing to work at freely. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - The minimum wage interferes with individual freedom and economic freedom.  And that's what's wrong with the minimum wage to a large extent.  It reduces -- it reduces -- it doesn't increase workers' bargaining power because it makes it illegal for the worker to offer her labor services for less than the minimum even though she's willing to do so because that's a better opportunity for her.  And it makes it illegal for the employer to hire that worker.  Also, it should be obvious that if you increase the wage rate above the going market wage rate, if it's only a little bit above, it's not going to have much of an effect.  But if it's quite a bit above, as happened in New York State in the early 2000s, then it led to a about 20 percent decrease in the unemployment rate in New York State for teenage workers aged about 16 to 24 without a high school diploma.  They kind of cut off the bottom rung for the ladder.  They couldn't get in the market. There was a surplus.  There's lots of jobs when the wage rate is lower; when if goes higher, there's fewer jobs.  But many workers want to get those jobs at the minimum wage.  The government promises people a minimum wage, but the politicians can't keep that promise because there's two sides to the market.  The employers will not hire as many workers when the wage rate goes up.  And in the short run, there may not be much unemployment.  But in the longer run, as Russ pointed out, the employers will substitute skilled workers for unskilled workers.  They might use a computer and have one worker rather than ten, or they may substitute labor-saving devices.  And there's lots of evidence to show this.  Just an article in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend, woman was running -- she runs bakeries, cupcake bakeries.  She hires -- she has about ten young workers working for her.  She said because of the anticipated increase in the minimum wage and the indexation, that she's going to replace those ten workers with some tablets and a skilled worker to run the operation so that they can order using the tablets. Another person that owns some restaurants and so forth, he's going to go to use his new app called Squared, which basically makes it easier to clear checks and process credit cards.  And he will displace about 30 out of his 75 workers, he said in that interview.  So this is a reality.  The woman that lost her job in New Hampshire, that's not just a statistic, that's a personal story.  We can play games with statistics.  And there's a preponderance of evidence, as I said, that the minimum wage has these detrimental effects.  In fact, Neumark in his study, after looking at all these other studies, said his conclusion has not changed.  And it's a very, very rigorous study.  What else happens? Employers use temporary workers rather than full-time workers.  They might make one worker do the job of four because after all, there's a surplus of labor now. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - There's unemployed workers that are looking for these jobs so they can just, you know, lay somebody off and make the other workers work that much harder.  It also destroys jobs, jobs that used to be done in the United States.  When I was a kid, they had elevator operators in Buffalo, New York.  You won't see those anymore.  You might see them in Argentina.  They don't have baggers at the grocery stores.  Those have become full-time jobs, in many cases, unionized.  And it slows job growth.  There was just a new study out by Texas A&M showing that the minimum wage has slowed job growth, which we should expect.  How do you explain these huge unemployment rates among black male teenagers that are, you know, over 30 percent?  In Spain, they have a very rigid minimum wage.  And the unemployment rate there is 26 percent, the national rate.  The unemployment rate among younger workers -- unskilled workers who are typically younger workers, is double that.  How do you explain that? The minimum wage, also, by the way, does not reduce the poverty rate.  Poverty rate has actually increased a little bit because of the minimum wage.  Doug Adie and other people have looked at that; Neumark as well.  And if you can't get a job -- because, remember, the law -- what does it do?  It increases the wage rate, but if you don't get a job, your income is zero.  That's what a lot of people don't understand.  The difference between the wage rate, which is the price, and income, which is the price of labor times the hours worked.  If you can't get a job, your income's zero.  So we found that the people that this affects are low skilled workers in low income families, and that's why the poverty rate is affected.\", 'Okay, so -- [applause]', \"Yeah, two points.  If there's an excess supply of labor, low-skilled labor, and they can't get jobs, yeah, the minimum wage will come down.  But the competition will be among the workers.  The workers that have lower valued alternatives, they can't get a job at the minimum wage, they will not have an opportunity to get a job.  I think that's a very important point.  Their wages will not stay low forever.  Most of these workers are young.  They will be in, they will get good work habits, they will learn things.  The employers will eventually pay them more as their productivity goes up.  You don't want to put the cart before the horse.  When you go to get a job, okay, the government can increase the minimum wage, give you a raise. But if your skills haven't changed and anything else, that's not going to -- that's not going to happen.\", \"Yeah, I want to address Karen's point on the moral argument.\", 'Yeah.', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 - Yeah, okay, responding to that point.  Most of these studies look at the short run, what happens in a very short period of time.  And there's mostly modest increases in minimum wage that would lead to modest decreases in employment.  And that shows up. But if you look at the long run, longer period of time where businesses that are just making marginal profits, and they can't increase prices much, they're going to cut back on low-skilled workers.  And all workers aren't the same.  All teenagers aren't the same. Some are -- have better work ethics and so forth.  So these are the workers that are going to be retained, and other workers are going to lose their jobs.  And these workers that lose their jobs cannot come back and say, Okay, I'd be willing to work at the wage I worked at before.  This is the thing that I dislike about the minimum wage: it puts government in between the employer and the worker.  It politicizes the decision about employment.  Instead of letting the worker who knows his or her alternatives best, come in and negotiate.  Now, they might say the worker has no bargaining power.  Well, if that were true, you could pay the worker anything you wanted.  But if you pay workers too low, you see Help Wanted signs. Employers want to hire workers, and they want to train workers, and they will spend money training workers.  This happened in Hong Kong.  You know, she points to Hong Kong.  Hong Kong has been the number one economically freest country or region or special administrative region or whatever you want to call it in the world.  China does not have a federal minimum wage.  They have local minimum wages, and most of those local minimum wages, especially in the coastal areas, have been below the prevailing wage.  The politicians there want to create jobs, and they know if the wage rate is too high, the official one, they won't create those jobs.\", \"Yeah, I'll come back to this -- [applause] -- moral argument.  If you think that people --\", \"Now, I want to come back to this moral argument, because I think it's an important point.  The question is whether individuals should be free to choose on their own terms, as long as there's not fraud involved and violence, to make themselves better off as they Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 - see it or whether the government should mandate a wage rate which may put you out of a job. If the government says the employer has to pay you $9 an hour and you're only producing $5 a hour, you're going to lose your job.  Now, why is the worker getting $5 an hour?  Because he or she doesn't have very many good alternatives.  They don't have much education.  So the real way you want to increase their income -- you increase the wage rate, they lose their job, their income is zero.  How do you increase their real income over time?  They have to have a better education.  They have to have work habits.  They don't get any work experience if they can't find a job.  And people do lose their jobs.  There's lots of evidence on this. Douglas Adie did a very good study showing that when the real minimum wage rate, that is, adjusted for inflation, increased by 10 percent, he found that there was a almost four percent increase in the unemployment rate for low-skilled workers, in the long run, after firms made adjustments. That's an economic -- that's what you'd expect from economic theory.  The economic --\", 'Of course.', 'Well, ask this lady that lost her job in New Hampshire.', \"No, there's --\", \"There's 3.4 million --\", \"Yeah.  I don't believe in ad hominem attacks.  Obviously, it's an example.  But --\", \"-- a personal example, it's something other than just a raw statistic.  It's a human being. People should be free to choose.  That's -- it's a free country.  The government shouldn't be involved in this.  It's --\", '-- if the government --', \"-- wasn't involved, would we go down the --\", 'Yeah.', 'Okay.', \"I guess what she's saying is that you have to have a minimum wage for all these college graduates that can't get jobs.  Well, they won't get a job if the minimum wage is above the market wage.\", \"Well, I would take just the opposite position.  The American dream for most of our grandparents and maybe some of our parents and so forth, was to come to the United States from countries that had repression and so forth.  There were no minimum wages. They could get a job.  They learned how to speak English.  They got on-the-job training, and their families were made better off over time.  Immigrants coming over here now, if they're low skilled, they're not going to have that opportunity.  And teenage workers without a high school degree that might be going to work and getting a job, these people aren't going to get jobs.  The Card-Krueger study did not -- did not look at people that actually lost their jobs from smaller establishments.  It was -- they did a survive on franchise restaurants.  And they didn't take into account the people that actually lost their jobs.  Now, these marginal firms don't make a lot of profits.  They're making a normal return on investment over the longer period of time.  And if they have to pay a higher wage rate, they're going to either fire some workers, or they're going to have less to reinvest in the firm to expand it.  Other workers who -- sure, some workers gain, they keep their job, but other workers will lose their job and either go in the shadow economy or eventually end up on welfare maybe. So I want more opportunities for workers.  And the government, just by saying you're going to pay a higher wage, as if there's no effects, is nonsense.  It's like the law of gravity.  The law of gravity operates even though leaves may blow up in the wind.  The Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 - law of demand operates.  And when prices go up, people buy less, especially in the long run when they make substitutions.  It's just common sense.\", \"I think most establishments already pay more than the minimum wage.  And if the -- if the wage rate dropped for some workers, the lowest of the lower skilled workers, yeah, their wage rate may go down in the short run, but they'll have a job.  And their wage rate's not going to stay at a low level forever if they work hard.  That's the point.  You're pricing these -- the politicians are pricing these people out of the market in the name of doing good.  It's a feel-good policy, and the empirical evidence -- the preponderance of empirical evidence supports the idea that raising the wage rate arbitrarily will reduce jobs more so in the long run.  There's just a ton of evidence.  So it's not just based on the evidence, it's based on common sense, and just looking -- observing reality.  You --\", \"Well, with the minimum wage, there are only so many jobs to go around.  It's the old lump of labor fallacy since the wage rate is not allowed to go down if there's a surplus. So you're stuck.  And the employers have a lot more power to dictate certain things to workers.  They would have more flexibility and more freedom for both the employers and the workers if you got rid of the minimum wage.  And I think if you got rid of it, the wage rate wouldn't change that much, because we're pretty close to the -- where the market wage rate would be.  That's why politicians don't have large increases in the minimum wage.  They can get the political brownie points, a feel-good policy, where most people think that the minimum wage is a good thing.  That's why they don't increase it by a lot.  When they have increased it by a lot, for example, in New York State, the study that was done -- I pointed to earlier -- it led to fairly significant decrease in employment.  It is -- also the empirical evidence, it's just not common sense. There's a lot of empirical evidence on our side of the argument.  So, I think Jared is unfair to mention that -- he doesn't mention anything about this most recent NBER study, which is much more sophisticated than the John Smith study that they like to cite.\", \"Markets don't lead to privation; markets lead to prosperity.  Historical evidence shows this.  A Mexican immigrant came over to the United States not too long ago.  He couldn't get a job because he was illegal probably. But he did get a job eventually in San Francisco at below minimum wage at a Chinese laundry.  He worked there for a couple years, then he went to Georgia.  He worked in the slaughter house at a little bit higher wage rate.  And now he owns a chain of Mexican restaurants in Georgia.  He had a dynamic and had a dream to come here to find an opportunity.  If he would've obeyed the law and the employer obeyed the law, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 - he would've never had that opportunity.  A friend of mine was making $0.72 an hour when he first started work.  That was his first job.  He rose up and became a very, very successful businessman.  He said that first job gave him work habits and a lifelong dream of basically being his own boss, making his own decisions, not relying on the government to increase his wage.  The minimum wage decreases opportunities for low skilled workers in low income families.  We need to abolish the minimum wage, not increase it.  There's a better way to help the poor than the minimum wage. [applause]\"]\n",
      "['Its called Fight of the Century.  How many people have seen that?  We actually -- with John Papola, we produced two of them, two rap videos.  And I want to make it clear on the record Im not singing in either one of them. [laughter] And 6.3 million people have viewed them on YouTube, or maybe a few less than that, because people have kind of seen it 4- or 500 times.', \"We need to abolish the minimum wage.  And there's only one argument that matters on this issue, and it's the moral argument.  Does the minimum wage make the world a better place?  And does it improve or hurt the lives of the poorest American families and the workers who are in those families?  Now, those Americans with the least education and the lowest skill levels have struggled tremendously over the last three decades. They find themselves in competition with machines, computers, automation, with foreign workers.  Their job opportunities have shrunk.  Their standard of living is mediocre at best, but the minimum wage is the wrong way to help those people.  It attacks the effects of economic change rather than doing anything about the underlying causes.  And by doing so, it hurts the people that we're trying to help. You don't need a special theory of the labor market or a degree in economics to understand that making workers artificially more expensive makes it harder for them to find work.  Now, those who support the minimum wage will tell you it's necessary to create a level playing field between employers and employees, that workers need the bargaining power that they are -- that they're missing, and the minimum wage makes that up.  But in reality, most of us don't need that extra help.  95 percent of workers who are paid the hourly wage, which is about 75 million Americans -- 95 percent of those make more than the minimum wage already.  And that includes my cleaning lady, who I pay over two times the minimum wage.  Now, why do I do that?  Because I'm an incredibly nice person.  Well, that's what I like to think.  But I really know better, because I'm an economist.  The reason I play my cleaning lady almost $20 an hour is because if I don't, she doesn't show up.  She has other alternatives that she will turn to if I don't meet her market wage.  It is those alternatives that protect her from the greed of employers. And alternatives force employers to treat employees well and most of us don't need legislation to protect us in the labor force.  But the minimum wage does boost the salary of about 3.5 million Americans.  About half of those, 1.7 million, are young people, 16 to 24.  They get helped by the minimum wage as do those who make a little more than that, because it boosts the attractiveness of those workers relative to what it would otherwise be without the minimum wage.  But those artificially high wages, that boost in wage discourages employers from hiring other workers who are low-skilled and have little experience.  This is particularly tragic today, when the unemployment rate among 16-to 24-year-olds is 16 percent.  And for African Americans -- young African Americans, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - it's over 29 percent.  Almost one in three.  Now, many who support the minimum wage will argue that somehow you could raise wages artificially and there'll be no net effect on employment. But who believes that employers don't respond to incentives to higher wages and try to find ways to save costs?  That's why employers replace workers with machines.  That's why they send factories overseas.  And that's why manufacturing employment has been falling steadily in recent decades, not just as a proportion of the total, but in absolute numbers, because fewer and fewer low-skilled workers who used to do those jobs are needed to produce the goods that we still make and manufacture.  And by the way, the U.S. manufacturing sector, in output terms, is thriving.  But in employment terms, it's struggling.  And those are the places that people without a college degree used to find a good job.  Those opportunities are shrinking. Why would artificially increasing the wages of workers, especially those who don't go to college and who don't finish high school -- why would artificially increasing those wages make those workers better off? Why would it have no effect on their employment?  Consider my favorite exemption to the minimum wage: the internship.  The internship is a very special kind of violation of the minimum wage.  You pay zero.  You're allowed to pay zero.  You're allowed to pay less than the minimum wage as long as it's zero.  How strange is that?  But we all understand that, for our kids, that's a glorious thing.  It's what's needed because their skills aren't often worth $7.25 an hour, and we want them to get that experience at the bottom of their -- at the beginning, at the bottom of the economic scene, so they can get the experience, and the mentoring, and all the things that come with being in the workplace.  And thank goodness that there is a special exemption for zero.  Does anybody think that if we got rid of that, there'd be more opportunities for young people?  Others justify the minimum wage by saying the effects are small -- the employment effects.  Small?  When you lose your job or can't find one, the effect isn't small, it's 100 percent. So it's nice to give 1.7 million young workers a raise, but what about the 3.4 million unemployed workers 16-to-24, last month, who can't find work?  We're increasing the wages of 1.7 million and making it harder for 3.4 million to find work, twice as many.  I don't accept that tradeoff.  That's a tragedy.  I reject it.  It's a bad bargain.  The irony of the minimum wage is that it reduces the bargaining power of the people at the bottom end.  It reduces the number of opportunities they have while increasing the number of people who are trying to find them.  The best argument for the minimum wage is that Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - our school system is a failure, so we have to do something to help those at the bottom. But this is the wrong way to fix it.  It's an additional barrier to the least skilled workers of America, making it harder for them to find work, those who have the least education, the least ability, the fewest connections, the ones who desperately need that first job to start their career.  I beg you to consider that the best intentions don't always lead to good results.  Abolish the minimum wage. Let young people and the least skilled have a better chance of getting the experience they need to thrive and prosper.  Thank you very much. [applause]\", \"Well, we can't answer that precisely.\", \"I certainly wouldn't abolish it tomorrow.  I'd want to phase it out.  But as I said earlier, about 3.5 million workers today earn the minimum wage or less.  Some of those, by the way, are -- about a million of them are in the food service business.  And many of those make tips that boost their wages higher than what they're listed in the data.  But it's about 3.5 million workers.  So some of those would have lower wages.  And the real question is, what else would employers do?  What else would happen in the workplace if workers didn't have to be paid a legal minimum? And I think there'd be a lot more opportunity for those 3.4 million unemployed 16-to 24-year-olds that have had the rug pulled out from under them, because we have a policy in place that makes them expensive.  And I think that's a terrible mistake.\", \"Well, I don't know.  I think some employers would take advantage of the change in the law to lower wages.  And they would have lower income.  The question is, what's the right way to help people who have low skills or who are struggling for all kinds of reasons, many of which are not their fault?  We have a horrible school system.  We ought to fix our school system instead of trying to help people through this artificial method.  If the artificial method worked, I'd be -- it'd be great.  It'd be great.  When Karen says we can afford it, we can afford it, this group, because we all make more than the minimum wage. And I would guess that most of the people in this room -- because 95 percent of the American workforce does earn more than the minimum wage, it would have very little effect on us.  It's the people that we don't see, people who have the toughest time finding work, who are punished by this good intention -- well-intentioned law.\", \"That's correct.\", \"What's the source of that --\", \"What's the source for 2 million?  Because the BLS doesn't collect that data.\", 'Okay.', \"They don't collect the hours data in [unintelligible].\", 'May I respond to my friend?', \"I want to just say something general about the empirical literature on the minimum wage.  There have been hundreds of studies done on both sides, actually hundreds have found that the minimum wage reduces employment.  That was the consensus among economists until the Card and Krueger study in the 1990s.  And that consensus has shifted somewhat.  Now there are many economists who think that the effects are either small or minimal.  Again, I would emphasize that small to me does not mean it's irrelevant.  Small is still people's lives.  But the point is that both --\", \"Oh, no.  The trend is definitely -- there are definitely studies in respected journals that show little effect of the minimum wage on unemployment.  And there are just as many studies on the other side saying, no, those studies are wrong.  Strangely enough, Jared and Karen, who I like very much -- [laughter] Russell Roberts: Seriously, I've been on many panels with Jared.  We have a good time.  Those studies haven't convinced -- those studies that show that there have been serious losses of jobs, which Jim mentioned one of them, the Sabia, Burkhauser, Hanson study of New York workers, 20 percent drop in workers without a high school diploma.  That's an incredible tragedy.  They don't find that persuasive.  The study wasn't done well.  Strangely enough, we don't find the studies that find the other side persuasive as well.  There's a big ideological gap between these two sides that we should be honest about, because if the studies were great, they would win.  They would convince people.  But the reason they don't convince people is that the world is a complicated place, as both Karen and Jared have said.  There's a lot of things going on at once, and it's really hard to hold things constant.  It gets a lot harder when the minimum wage affects a relatively small part of the population.  So when 95 percent of Jared -- if I want to accept some of your salaried workers, some slightly smaller percentage of the workers earn more than minimum wage already, yeah, it's going to be hard to tease out the independent effect of that relative to all the other things that change in the economy at the same time. So it's very hard to do.  It's not persuasive to the opponents.\", 'Yeah.', 'Well, Jared and I agree on something very important, which is economics is not a science.  That\\'s good.  It\\'s a start.  It\\'s more like history with a lot of numbers.  It\\'s nothing like physics or the sciences.  So to me, the word \"social\" in front of it, it\\'s a very important qualifier.  And I think the challenge is the empirical evidence that Jared\\'s talking about, I view as very unpersuasive.  And it\\'s -- I know it\\'s unpersuasive because it doesn\\'t persuade the opponents. No one reads these studies that are full of equations, and Greek letters, and lots of fancy statistical work, and go, \"Oh, my gosh --\"', '\"-- I\\'ve been wrong all my life.\"  I don\\'t know.  It doesn\\'t happen. [talking simultaneously]', 'In theory it could, but I -- everybody always says, \"Oh, they left this out.  They didn\\'t do this right.\"  They always have a reason, and that\\'s because of the fundamental complexity of human society.  So I want to ask instead of that -- those kinds of studies which I dont think persuade even economists, and they shouldn\\'t persuade you, I want to ask you to do the following experiment.  If you decided to quit your job, you didn\\'t like your job, you were bored, you wanted to try something else, and now you\\'re going to go out in the workplace and find a new job, but the government passes a law that for you to be -- when you go to your new job, your new employer has to pay you, say -- let\\'s pick a small -- relatively small number, 20 percent more than your current job.  That\\'s the law.  So you\\'ve switched jobs, youve got to get 20 percent more, do you think that would be good for you or bad for you?  You realize -- and my question is to my opponents, do you think that would make it harder for you to find work?  They\\'re arguing that, \"Oh, empirically -- it\\'s an empirical question.  Empirically, it doesn\\'t have any effect when you artificially raise people\\'s wages.\" So you, you have no extra skills, nothing new, you come into the workforce, \"Yay, the government\\'s passed a law.  You have to be paid 20 percent more than in your last job.\" Would you be happy?  Would you be excited about that?  I think you\\'d be scared.  I would be.  I think it\\'s very difficult.', 'Yeah.  And --', \"Yeah.  I'll let Jim go first.\", \"Yeah.  I just want to say -- yeah, there's one person New Hampshire, and there's another 3.4 million who are younger than that friend of Jim's who don't have jobs right now, who want them, who aren't able to support their family and aren't able to get the meaningfulness out of life that a real job helps you achieve. [applause] Thank you for the applause, but you're not supposed to do that.  Now, so I think, again, ask -- Jared makes a good point.  Most minimum wage workers think it's a good thing. They won't if they lose their jobs, though.  They're not experts in economics.  They're not experts on thinking about how their businesses might respond.  We're here to have a discussion and to think about these ideas.  And again, ask yourself -- ask for your children, those of you who have children, would you want your child to go out into the workforce being only told they can only get a job if they can make at least $15 an hour or $20 an hour, or 25?  $7.25, it turns out, not such a big hurdle, because 80 percent of teenagers are able to earn that anyway on top of it.  So again, I would make the point, the minimum wage right now is fairly small and not as harmful as it would be if we raised it, for example, so we -- that is true.  It's fairly small, but it's not small for the people whose lives are affected.\", 'Great --', \"You're not quoting me quite accurately.  I didn't say it wasn't causing any problems.  I said the problems are relatively small and they're hard to measure.  And as a result, it's relatively pleasant for most people because 95 percent of the people don't need it who aren't in the hourly -- who earn an hourly wage.\", 'Because every worker who earns -- whose productivity is under $7.25 an hour right now is having a very difficult time making their way in the world, especially young workers.', 'I would have a slightly different perspective on this.', \"I think part of the problem we have with education right now is that we've subsidized it, which is a lovely idea.  And as a result, it's pushed up tuition, and it's allowed colleges to raise their prices, their tuition a great deal.  And as a result, many students have borrowed have a lot of money.  And as a result, they're in big trouble.  And especially in a downtime of economic growth when economic growth is so mediocre.\", \"The living wage isn't by the taxpayer.  I think it's usually a proposal to just have a higher minimum wage that would be able to support a family more easily.  What kind of business do you have?  I'll repeat it for those -- since you have the mic. Female Speaker: I have a consulting business. Russell Roberts: You have a consulting business.  And your workers are paid -- you said you have some that are paid $8.25 an hour? Female Speaker: No, I said that's the minimum wage in Washington, D.C. Russell Roberts: So none of your workers earn the minimum wage. Female Speaker: No. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 - Russell Roberts: No.  There are some who do, though, and that's very hard on them, and that's no doubt about it.  Right now there's a proposal with the city council of Washington to increase the minimum wage for special stores that have large footprints.  This would be stores like Costco and Home Depot and super Wal-Mart.  There are very few of those in Washington, D.C.  But they want to raise it to 11-something an hour.  The Washington Post came out the other day and said it's a horrible idea because Costco will leave.  They won't be able to make a living, unfortunately.  They have a lot of profit, but at $11.25, it's not clear they'll be able to keep that store in Washington.  And The Washington Post thinks that's a bad idea.  I do too.  I think it's a bad idea to -- especially to pick out special stores. Female Speaker: [unintelligible]. Russell Roberts: What?\", 'Sorry. [laughter]', \"Afterwards, I'm happy to talk some more.\", \"I'm comfortable.  I don't see any fruit.  I hear the applause, but I don't see any fruit, so I'm feeling pretty good.\", 'I would just say there are a lot of policies I would prefer to the minimum wage.  The earned income tax credit is preferable to the minimum wage.  Improving our school system is preferable to the minimum wage.  And I certainly agree with Karen that people like to stand on their own two feet, and I would emphasize, once again, that the minimum wage makes it harder, not easier.', 'Well, I agree.  It does --', \"--prop up the minimum wage for -- and it has a bigger effect on the people who just earned it.  And that's part of the reason why Wal-Mart, which pays more than the minimum wage, favors the minimum wage, because it makes their competitors more expensive.  It raises the cost to other firms that are smaller and won't -- can't afford to pay as much as Wal-Mart does.  So, I agree with the questioner, though. The level is relatively small, which means it's hard to measure.  And the harm is relatively small.  But as I started off by saying, for the people who can't find work, it's not small.  For the people who aren't worth it, it's very tragic.\", \"So horribly muddled, that's in between, I guess, nuts and unfair. [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 - It's not too bad.  There's a subtlety here, and it's a nice rhetorical flourish here.  But I think the argument is that when we say it's relatively small, we're not saying it's unimportant, we're saying it's difficult to measure. It's difficult to tease out the independent effects when many things are happening at the same time.  So as a result, when some states are doing well, they raise the minimum wage, and therefore it's hard to figure out what the independent effect is of what's going on underneath.  But my question for you is, since you reject the logic that we made, and you say it's only an empirical question, I'd like to know why you think employers over the last 30 years have relentlessly punished not deliberately, but through their actions, have relentlessly punished low-skilled workers because they are relatively unattractive compared to workers outside the United States and automation. Do you really think that work -- that employers don't respond to economic incentives?\", 'In September of 2011, the governor of American Samoa traveled 7,000 miles to testify for five minutes in front of Congress.  He begged Congress to stop increasing the minimum wage in American Samoa, a process that had begun in 2007 and was scheduled to increase until it reached the U.S. minimum of $7.25.  In 2009, employment on American Samoa fell 19 percent.  That\\'s because employment in the tuna canning industry, which was a third of their jobs, had fallen 55 percent.  The governor of American Samoa who came to testify blamed that collapse on the minimum wage.  And here\\'s a quote from him, his testimony, \"We are watching our economy burn down.  We know what to do to stop it.  We need to bring the aggressive wage cost decreed by the federal government under control.  Our job market is being torched, our businesses are being depressed.  Our question is this:  How much does our government expect us to suffer?  I have the same question for those two support the minimum wage here in the United States.  How much do you expect the least skilled among us to suffer?  Congress did stop increasing the minimum wage in American Samoa, thank goodness. They should have the same compassion for workers here in the United States and abolish the minimum wage here.  Right now, there are people within a few blocks of where we\\'re sitting who cannot find work simply because their skills are not worth $7.25 an hour.  Why would you condemn those men and women to a wage of zero? Why would you cut off the bottom of the economic ladder and deprive a human being of the chance to begin a life of honest work?  There are desperate people among us, people who have nowhere to turn, whose job prospects are poor.  Why make their lives worse?  It\\'s not just about the money.  It\\'s about giving people a chance to find meaning and satisfaction from standing on their own two feet.  Give the least skilled among us the chance they deserve.  Abolish the minimum wage.']\n",

      "['Absolutely.', \"Not necessarily.  I thought to make this interesting, I'm going to do the debate both in Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - Yiddish and actually -- [laughter] -- I was the first person to do that in a Federal Reserve speech, but I also used Latin in this speech.  So I'll do it in both languages and see how it goes.\", \"I'm a wild and crazy guy.\", 'So just to start, I have to tell you I went to Oxford for a year, and my mother, of course, I was a New Yorker, she said, \"How come you still talk like a New Yorker?\"  So it didn\\'t work.  But I never actually went to Oxford Union debates.  And this is actually styled after it.  I wish I had.  So what I\\'d like to do first is just to talk about the way that we\\'re going to branch out in terms of my teammate and I.  I\\'m going to focus first on the domestic economy.  And actually because of what I do for a living, both in terms of the research I\\'ve done and the fact that I was a policy maker at the Federal Reserve, and my teammate John Taylor is going to focus on the international ramifications of a strong dollar policy. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - So let me actually go out and make two points.  And the first point is that when we think about what is good policy, I\\'m going to say what is a good policy for the American economy.  And in particular, the first thing we have to do is ask where are we right now? And two things that I want to talk about is where are we in terms of our business cycle, where are we in terms of unemployment?  Not very good.  We have unemployment rate of 7.7 percent.  People are out there struggling.  And furthermore, we\\'re in a situation where we also have inflation which is actually too low, so inflation right now is actually running in the preferred measure, 1.2 percent, which is below their target level.  So in fact we\\'re in a situation where we\\'re not doing as well as we\\'d like on either component of what we think s important in terms of stabilizing the economy.  Furthermore, the economy is not growing that fast.  It\\'s been growing very, very slowly, hasn\\'t really picked up yet.  So we\\'re in a situation with a weak economy and actually inflation, which is on the low side.  So now let\\'s ask what would a strong dollar do? Well, a strong dollar would actually mean that the currency would go up in value; that would make American goods and services more expensive; if they\\'re more expensive people will buy less of them; that foreigners are not going to buy our goods and services the way they did before.  What will that do?  That will actually end up lowering the demand for our goods and services; as a result, our economy would actually weaken further.  Is that what we want?  Absolutely not right now, because we\\'d actually get an economy with higher unemployment and actually inflation, which would be even lower, which has been trending down, it\\'ll go actually down lower.  So it\\'s not the right policy at this particular point in time.  And so, in that sense, I think that it\\'s a very bad policy to think that what we need to do right now is to strengthen the dollar.  So that\\'s point one. Point two is a little bit more subtle and I\\'m going to be a little more academic here, that I\\'m actually going to argue that it\\'s a mistake to have any dollar policy, whether a strong one or a weak one.  Why?  Because what policy should focus on is stabilizing the economy; we should use our tools, both in terms of monetary policy and also fiscal policy, to actually stabilize the economy.  At the current juncture we\\'re in a situation where inflation is on the low side, we\\'re actually in a situation where unemployment is on the high side, so in this case, actually, we would think that we don\\'t want to have a strong dollar.  In fact, if our policies are expansionary, they might actually produce a weaker dollar; however, there are other circumstances where, in fact, a strong -- having tight policy would be the right thing to do.  In particular, we raise interest rates rather than keep them low.  And that would be a situation where we have a lot of inflation. And we\\'ve been in periods where, in fact, we\\'ve had high inflation, very worried about Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - it, and in that situation we would want to have tighter policy, either higher interest rates for monetary policy or tighter fiscal policy.  That would also result in a stronger dollar, then that would be okay, that would work in the right direction. A stronger dollar would weaken the economy, actually help lower inflation, and indeed in periods where we actually had to go out and control inflation we actually needed to go to policies that result in a strong dollar.  The point here is that in a situation where you focus on the dollar, you may very well get it wrong because that\\'s not the ultimate objective for policy makers.  The ultimate objective for policy makers should be to have a very strong economy.  So I\\'m going to end a little early, I\\'m told I get a little [unintelligible] points for ending a little early. But I made those two points and clearly there\\'ll be a lot of other discussion on these issues, maybe even the gold standard, which would be fun.  I have bad news for you, Steve, your wish is not going to be fulfilled. [laughter] I\\'m not a big fan of the gold standard.  I\\'m sure we\\'ll discuss that later.  But with that, why don\\'t I leave it to the other side?', 'So the first thing I should tell you is, I actually am proud that I have a Ph.D. and that Im a rocket scientist. [laughter] What can I tell you.  But I, first I want to talk about, I think that theres a sense jujitsu going on in that I actually strongly agree with the view that price stability should be the overriding long run -- overriding policy in the long run for monetary policy.  And in that context, youre absolutely right, that if you actually debauch the currency, if you have a lot of inflation, this is a very, very bad thing.  Im in no way advocating that. And indeed, when we actually look at the technology of actually producing stable inflation, the idea that in fact we should go back to the horse and buggy and go back to the gold standard, I think doesnt fly.  So let me give you reasons why.  If you actually look at the gold standard period, one of the things that you see, is that when you tie the currency to gold and you say a dollar is worth lets say 20 ounces, 20 dollars is worth ounce of gold for example, is what was done in that period.  The problem is that youre now in the vagaries of what happens to supply and demand for dollars.  And in particular, this is a period where in fact there wasnt a good dollar yardstick in the following sense, which is, the variability of inflation was much higher during the gold standard period than we have now.  Now what did happen in that period and one of the problems here was, that you actually very much affected by acts of God. So indeed we actually had a deflationary period in the 1880 -- from 1880 to about 1896, because they couldnt find any gold.  Then we had the Klondike and South Africa and actually there was inflation, because there were huge amounts of gold found in the ground.  So theres really an issue of technology here.  The question is, can you actually Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - get states stable inflation so you meet the definition of price stability, which Alan Greenspan I think said rightly so, is its like pornography, you know it when you see it. Its when you dont worry about whats happening to the price level in your day to day decisions.  We completely agree that thats the right way to run the economy.', 'Workers do better when there is low and stable inflation, that we agree on.  And in fact, low and stable inflation means that its not fluctuating a lot.', 'Because what hes saying thats different is that he wants a fixed value of the currency, the dollar, in terms of a commodity, lets say gold.  And that actually is not a situation where it produces stability in the price level.  During the gold standard, the price level went up, went down.  Now you are right, that over very long rises, over 40 year period, there was no change in price level.  Thats the good news.  The bad news is, that horizons are not 40 years.  As Cain said, in the long run, were all dead.', 'I want to change this issue a little bit, that --', \"No, no, I want to deal with the question in the following sense, which is that what goes on in the real economy is actually much less associated with what goes on in terms of the inflation that in fact you're attributing it to, and in particular, that a lot of things you've talked about in terms of high growth and so forth, or whether you have good institutions, a good legal system, and so forth, so what we really need to focus on is a narrower issue that -- does a  strong dollar actually help the economy?  Does it hurt it? Does having a good dollar yardstick help the economy?  Does it hurt it? I think that's very important, but not -- let's not get into this view that having a strong dollar, or gold standard, or weak dollar actually solves all of our problems.  This actually solves very little of the problems.  It's still important. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 -\", \"I would actually disagree with that.  I think you're absolutely right that we went through an extremely bad period, we actually call it the great inflation period.  It was extremely bad policy --\", 'Wait.  And also the fiscal irresponsibility, but this is a choice of the governments are spending too much relative to what they take in.', \"First of all, I wouldn't want to say that the dollar -- the value of a dollar should be the tool we're using.  What we do need is the technology in order to keep the dollar yardstick working in a way that we can actually plan in the future, know what the price level is going to be next year so that we actually can make good decisions.  We actually agree on that.  The question is what kind of technology do you want to use?  Do we need to go back to the era with --\", 'So what I mean by this is that one technology is actually to tie the dollar to gold.  That\\'s a technology.  Another kind of technology that you can use is, in fact, what central banks have been adopting and actually very successfully in terms of something called inflation targeting.  They have actually adopted a policy of saying \"We\\'re trying to keep inflation stable, in the last 10, 15 years have been very successful at doing that.  They have not solved other problems like financial stability, but there are reasons why that has to be a concern of a separate nature.', 'Sorry that I got you so upset.', \"And if your -- if your bowtie got unraveled, that's the question that I want to ask. [laughter]\", 'Again, the issue is, youre right, the bubbles can be very disastrous, particularly ones that involve credit markets.  And weve just gone through a terrible period this way.  But in fact this has been happening through history and in fact has been happening frequently when weve had gold standards and also when we didnt.  During the gold standard era, we actually had these bubbles all the times in the U.S.  We had financial crises about every 10 to 20 years, so youre right that this is something that we have to worry about.  But catching the -- basically the strong dollar policy that you advocate is not going to produce the outcome you want.  We actually need policies to think about moderating credit cycles.  Thats something we have to worry about.  I think we agreed on that.  But in fact tying to gold, maybe you see it, but I sure as hell dont/', \"I'm a little shocked here, which is we are talking as if we're in a period which we were in where we had super high inflation, and this was a huge problem, that's not the period we're in right now.  We've had actually very stable inflation in the last 15 years.\", 'But let me [unintelligible].', 'One of the things weve learned--', \"One of the things that we've learned is that actually getting price stability doesn't solve the problem of financial instability, doesn't solve the problem that we sometimes have these bubbles.  That's in fact something that we do have to deal with. Indeed, one of the views in terms of research is that actually having a stable period may actually encourage a bubble because people dont think there's enough risk, and in fact there is a lot of risk.  So I can't see how we're going to solve the problems here of Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - bubbles by actually being in a situation where we actually tied to some kind of commodity.\", 'Excuse me?', \"Yes, because the way to think about this is that inflation is a -- it's what you think is the right rate of inflation is a means to an end.  What we really want to have is high growth in the economy and stability in the economy, that's what we're really after.  And if you have an inflation rate which is too low, then you're actually in a situation where you get deep deflation, something that you think is not a problem, but I can tell you, when you look at history and ask when we've had the worst crises, and the worst recessions, and the worst depressions, they were always associated with deflation. So this is not something that I see as a particular positive.  So you actually want to protect against not having too high inflation and not having too low.  The second thing that's very important in this regard is that when you have an inflation rate which is too low, you actually get into a situation where sometimes, because of a very negative shock as we've had recently, you would actually like to drive nominal interest rates below zero.  You'd like to drive the federal funds rate negative, and you can't do it, and, therefore, you can't stimulate the economy enough.  So this is actually a problem that we worry about tremendously in terms of the policy circles.  And what it tells you is you want to have a deflation rate which is, one, not so high that you spend a lot of time actually making decisions about where the price level's going to be, but instead produce, which produces a good economy, but secondly not so low that you end up in a situation where you get deflations, where you get this situation where you can't do Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - expansionary policy when you need it, and as a result you have to pick a number in between.  Most central banks have chosen around [unintelligible].\", 'So the issue that I would raise here is when we look at history --', 'Okay.  So do you feel that, in fact -- that the economy was much more stable during the gold standard period than it has been in other periods?', 'I would actually respond to that, which is when you actually ask what happens in terms of growth rates, most of this has nothing to do with monetary policy, with gold, or anything else -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -', 'It has to do with technology and so forth --', 'We were also, really, the only country left standing.  At that point we had over 50 percent of the manufacturing capacity in the world.', 'Not actually on that question, but I want to do a fact check, because Steve Forbes said something that I have some data in front me, actually by somebody they know very well.  This is a paper that Anna Schwartz who I think you would consider to be the leading monetary historian of this generation along with Milton Friedman. And in fact, she looked at different periods, and the period of the classical gold standard, when the U.S. was continuing in the gold standard, was not a period of high growth.  So the numbers right here is that the U.S. grew at 1.8 percent per year at that time.', 'From 1881 to 1913.  This is as paper that Anna wrote Mike Bordo called Monetary Policy Regimes and Economic Performance: the Historical Records.  So its very much on this topic. Actually there was a lot of instability, that the standard deviation, how much variability there was, was 4.9.  For her data, looking at the period from 1974 to 1995, which is after Bretton Woods went off the gold standard, that we actually had a situation where growth is about the same amount, with much less instability.  My argument here is not that I think that the gold standard was good or bad for growth, but that it was not the key aspect.', 'The first period is from 1881 to 1913.', 'And also they wore bow ties then too. [laughter]', \"I'm sorry, but -- [talking simultaneously] -- I can tell you that this is research done with the best data that was available by somebody whose integrity is impeccable.  And in fact she's not the only one to come up with these kind of numbers.  Now, you may not believe them, but you have different numbers, but unfortunately I have to go with what I think is good scholarship.\", 'But how can you say that the gold standard prevents this?  The Great Depression was a Intelligence Squared U.S. - 44 - period where we were actually on the gold standard.', 'So I think volatility is key, and we can look at historical periods and say, \"How much volatility has there been?\"  So volatility of the business cycle, of employment, volatility of the growth of GDP, which was much higher during the period 1881 to 1913 and which is the period of the classical gold standard, the first great gold standard according to Jim, than it was in later periods.  That fact is very clear, I don\\'t know of any serious scholar -- you may have people that you think have other numbers, but I can tell you that when I\\'ve seen the research that has been done in this area by people who have tremendous integrity and are incredibly respected, Anna Schwartz being one of those people, they come up with exactly that answer.  And also there was actually much more volatility of the inflation rate during that period.  That\\'s the facts.', \"That's right, I'm a Ph.D., remember. [laughter]\", \"That's nothing to do with it. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 -\", 'So -- listen, your point is a fixed measure in terms of gold, but there are lot of other elements of what we buy during the day.  In fact, the CPI has very little gold in it.  A smidgeon, but very little.', 'We need stability in terms of the bask of goods and --', \"Oh, I'm sorry, CPI is the consumer price index.\", \"So we actually -- we do need confidence in terms of -- in terms of not having inflation move around a lot.  In fact, when we've had a problem is when we pursued extremely inflationary policies.  In fact, this is why we went off Bretton Woods, because we actually had a situation of very bad monetary policy and also bad fiscal policy as a result of fighting the Vietnam War and some serious mistakes that were made.  So stability --\", 'So I think stability is very key, that people do have to know that the dollar will actually purchase a similar amount of goods and services over time.  That, were in agreement of.  I dont think theres really disagreement among us.  The question is, whats the best way to get that to happen?  Fixing the dollar to gold is not the best way to get that to happen.', 'We got a moral person.', 'Neither.  Lets keep --', 'A situation where, when you go out and buy something, it, it costs about the same thing over time, so that you can plan, very simple.', 'Giddy yap baby, giddy yap.', 'In fact, I actually strongly oppose a policy which says were going to focus on the dollar. A weak dollar policy is not something Id advocate either.  And the reason is this, is exactly is, is youre focused on how your exports are doing well to competitors.  And thats not a great way to do policy.  Central banks and policy makers throughout the world should try to stabilize their economies.  And in fact, whatever way the value of the currencies go in that context, so be it.', 'I hope its not immoral. Lets get it right here. Female Speaker: Well maybe--', \"I also want the dollar to be a good measure of value, but this is an issue about having low and stable inflation.  It's not tying to gold.\", 'Or deflation for that matter. Well maybe you because you said you like it at one period.', 'The social trust in not having situation of having very high inflation, and we agree on that.  The question is what is the best -- I use the word \"technology,\" but the best way of getting that to happen, and my view on this is that in fact we do not get the stability that Steve would like to see us have [unintelligible] --', 'So Im not going to use higher mathematics.  In fact, thats never been really part of this discussion.  But I do want to talk about history.  And in fact, theres a very wonderful example about what happens when you pursue a strong currency policy.  It happened to deal with a great man who was great in helping save the world against Hitler, but was not a very good economist.  He was not a very good chancellor of the exchequer, which is the equivalent of the finance minister, or Secretary of the Treasury, and this is Winston Churchill. But what the U.K. decided to do after World War I, was to pursue a strong pound policy. They went back on the dollar -- on the pound -- excuse me, they went back on the gold standard in 1925.  They started taking measures to do this starting right after the war. What was the result of this?  Well, in order to do this they actually had very tight monetary policy, very high interest rates.  Were they successful?  Absolutely, in 1925, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 57 - they went back on gold.  What was the outcome?  The outcome was, that we had, the British had very high unemployment, they went to over 11 percent employment in 1921.  They then had extremely high unemployment all through the roaring 20s when everybody else was doing wonderfully.  Then of course it got worse.  But then even more important to the current situation, they actually were trying to be virtuous.  They had 130 percent of debt, sovereign debt, of their government debt relative to GDP after World War I, because it was so costly to fight it, they actually pursued very, very large, a budget surpluses, excluding interest payments. What happened to them?  Well, they went 140 percent of GDP in 1919, by the time you got to 1929, they were 170 percent of GDP.  So indeed, in this current juncture, where in fact we have to worry about fiscal consolidation, this ended up doing several things.  It meant it killed the economy.  They actually had deflation.  You talked -- Jim Grant talked about deflation as being a good thing during a period of American history.  It certainly was not a good thing for the British.  And what did you end up with?  You ended up with a much more dire fiscal situation, even when there was virtue.  A strong dollar policy would be something that would be very damaging to the economy and we do not need a strong dollar policy.']\n",
      "['I sure do.  They were fun.', 'My cottage business happens to be dealing with the world and the reality in the world, not like Jim\\'s which is dealing with the world the way he would like it to be. [laughter] I would start out by saying that, Jim, your first statement to Rick was that you would be cutting the number of employees at the Fed.  I would say that if we follow any of your policies, we\\'d be cutting the number of employees everywhere. [applause] And, unfortunately, unfortunately, yes, the dollar is as good as paper, and every currency in the world is as good as paper. We\\'re not worse.  We\\'re not better.  But the fact of the matter is, is that your dollar that\\'s as good as paper is convertible into anything.  You don\\'t have to hold those dollars.  I give another speech trying to sell our cash management program where I tell people -- I hold up a Zimbabwean hundred trillion dollar note that\\'s worth about 20 cents and tell people that \"You shouldn\\'t just keep your money in the United States, you should put your money around the world.  You should be free.\"  But the fact of the matter is, is that almost everybody wants to keep their money in the United States. Why can the Treasury borrow at 2 percent?  They\\'re not forcing you to lend them at 2 percent.  They\\'re not forcing the Bank of England to invest its money at 2 percent. They\\'re not enforcing the Chinese to invest their money at 2 percent.  But they do.  And, therefore, the dollar has a value.  Paper or not, it\\'s got a value.  And gold is not necessary. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - Also today everybody has the pleasure of borrowing with their own currency unless, of course, your currency is Zimbabwe and nobody wants to hold that.  By the way, the latest figure I saw was that the National Bank of Zimbabwe had $210 in its account. [laughter] That\\'s the central bank.  I don\\'t know.  The value\\'s probably changed in the last week or two.  But because everyone has the privilege of borrowing in their own currency, and that means Brazil, all kinds of emerging countries, we\\'re no longer on this standard where the U.S. has a -- you know, there\\'s power over the world, we borrow in our own currency, and everybody else is stuck.  They have to, you know, balance their budget, do all the right things.  No, unfortunately, in a way, from Jim\\'s point of view, and I\\'m sure Steve\\'s, as we\\'ll hear, everybody has this ability to borrow too much.  I don\\'t think it\\'s a good idea, I don\\'t think it\\'s necessarily going to end well. I believe in a lot of things that tend to be conservative, but the fact of the matter is that a strong dollar policy has a lot of impact on the United States, as my partner Rick has pointed out.  It would hurt us dramatically if that happened, and also, the dollar has a very strong impact on the rest of the world.  If you\\'re looking at the easy side of this from the U.S.\\'s point of view, what impact does a strong dollar have?  Well, for a start it has a lot of impact on jobs in Ohio, in Michigan, in places where we actually produce things in the United States, because the stronger our dollar is, the less likely it is we are to have a manufacturing sector.  In 1985, when the U.S. had a strong dollar policy, and after a while a stated strong dollar policy under Ronald Reagan and Volcker, we began to develop something that we now call, and it came into practice then, \"the rust belt.\" And the reason that was the rust belt is all of a sudden we couldn\\'t produce anything that could compete with the rest of the world because the dollar was too damn strong. So now we all drive Mercedes and Toyotas and whatever, we do not drive things that come out of Michigan.  Now, let\\'s face it, Michigan has other problems, and if you were -- I know I\\'m going to get defeated on this, Toyotas are all made in the United States, Hondas are made in the United States, yeah, in Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama.  There are reasons for that.  But the fact of the matter is that the strong dollar -- the weak dollar today has brought these European and Japanese companies into the United States, even Korean, and if we had a strong dollar they would go, too.  One of the things that the Japanese are trying to do with their latest effort is to make the Toyota plants come back to Japan so that they can actually employ Japanese to make Toyotas instead of people from Kentucky or Tennessee. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - So the dollar is very, very important domestically for us, and basically if you have a strong dollar you end up with a situation where the rich get richer and there aren\\'t a hell of a lot of jobs. How does the world do with the dollar?  A strong dollar is bad for the world as well. And it\\'s kind of perverse, because if you would argue that, oh, gee whiz, if youve got a strong dollar, then anybody can sell anything to us.  Right?  Because everything looks cheap to us, right?  And I must say that, you know, in the 1960s everything did look cheap to us.  Now a lot of things look quite expensive.  In fact, one of the worst things about a weak dollar is the fact that we can\\'t go to Europe on vacation; it\\'s too damn expensive.  If we had a strong dollar, Europe would be cheap and we could all go on vacation, but at the same time, all the New York City hotels would be empty, whereas now you walk around the New York City hotels, well, they\\'re just loaded with people from places that I never thought could possibly afford New York.

You might be paying 6 percent for your dollars, but hell, if the dollar goes down 10 percent a year, you\\'re paying minus 4. So it\\'s a gift.  So when the dollar is weak, people borrow money from Citibank, from JP Morgan, from Goldman Sachs, the people doing these deals, and our banking system does very well. When the dollar is strong, all of a sudden these people are, \"Oh, my god, I now owe more for this loan, and my plant that I built in Thailand isn\\'t as successful as I thought, and so I have to close it down and I have to lay off workers.\"  So when the dollar gets strong, all of a sudden the rest of the world economies go down, and so, actually, the United States is in a bit of a problem.

If stability is the goal of government and of government policy, then it must lean against the wind, whichever way that wind is blowing.  If the economy is growing too fast, it must act to slow the economy; and if the economy is growing too slowly, it must act to speed it up. That is the policy that the government has been following for at least since World War II.  That policy, at least according to Jan Tinbergen, who did win a Nobel Prize in economics, the first one, given in 1953, said that there were four independent variables that drove the government's ability to control the economy and the economic outputs that are important to the people who live there.  And so that's why I'm worried about the social welfare of the people. Those policies were money growth, interest rate levels, fiscal policy, i.e., the level of taxing and the level of spending, and the currency value.  Currency value was one of the four instruments that was chosen to manage the government output.  That was in 19 -- actually, earlier than 1953.  The Nobel Prize is never given to somebody who's done the work right then.  But was involved with the Bretton Woods situation, and it was even-- by one of the leading economists of the world recognized that  even under that time -- that currency movement was critical to keeping the world moving forward.  So my argument is that we should have a flexible policy that allows us to lean into the wind, or lean, -against it, depending on which way we need the government to act.  And so, therefore, we need that flexibility and we are against a strong dollar policy.\"]\n",

      "['[inaudible]', 'A philosopher of science, and I deal with the issues of ethics and also contested issues in science, and, of course, genetics provides great material. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 4 -', 'Absolutely.', 'My partner is Professor Robert Winston.', \"Thank you.  Thank you very much.  The proposition before us today, to me means prenatal genetic modification of human reproductive cells, like sperm or eggs or fertilized eggs, called the zygote, in preparation for gestation in the womb and development to full term infants should be prohibited at the societal level, and to this I agree firmly. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - The two basic reasons to carry out such an intervention: one, for curing or preventing genetic disease; or, two, for the enhancement of a person.  For genetic diseases, in  the great majority of cases there are simpler, less risky, less costly, less ethically controversial, and more dependable methods of preventing the birth of a child with a severe genetic abnormality by using prenatal embryo diagnosis; that is, for diagnosing the embryos.  There are a couple of exceptions, which I think we will get to during this debate, such as mitochondrial disease.  And we'll have more to say about that later. Other than the exception, the only sensible rationale for engaging in genetic modification of the fertilized egg is for the enhancement of a child.  Enhancement might include intelligence, resistance to disease, greater height, muscle strength, appealing personality, longevity, any number of things you could imagine. Now, engaging in genetic modification of human gametes, the human reproductive cells, for enhancement is where I find the greatest moral failure and the greatest scientific folly.  I offer three reasons: first, whatever enhancement is sought, the only method for determining whether it would work would be to engage in a clinical trial where you would have dozens of fertilized eggs or embryos, genetically modify half of them, carry them all to term, follow the development of the children throughout their lives to determine whether the intervention worked and at what expense to their health.  No set of animal studies can ensure the safety and efficacy of human prenatal genetic modification.  It is unimaginable that any humane, democratic society would permit such a trial with public or private funds; the risk would so outweigh the societal benefits. My distinguished colleague, professor Winston, will address some of the risks, complexities, and uncertainties with procedures using a genetic scalpel in the early embryo.  Of course, the genetic modification of a single fertilized egg can be done outside of civil society, at some island community, where evidence of success, risks, and knowledge gained are of no concern.  So that certainly can always happen.  This takes us to the second reason that babies should not be genetically engineered for enhancement: from a biological and developmental standpoint, the so-called traits under consideration cannot remotely be enhanced by the modification of a gene or two. Traits like intelligence, personality, muscle tone, musicianship and -- are complex and not only involve dozens if not hundreds of genes but are the result of nutrition, social and environmental factors, genetic switches that are outside of the DNA and the gene- gene interactions that occur in human cells.  Scientists and the so-called trans- humanists who believe that it is possible think of the human genome as a Lego set, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - where pieces of DNA can be plugged in or out without interfering with the other parts of the system.  Actually, the human genome is more like an ecosystem where all the parts interrelate and are in mutual balance. Even for height, one of the most heritable traits known, scientists have found at least 50 genes that can account for only 2 to 3 percent of the variance of the samples.  So there could be hundreds of genes associated with height.  If you want a child, a tall child, marry tall. [laughter] Finally, the idea of genetic enhancement grows out of a eugenic ideology that human perfection can be directed by genetics.  The danger is not so much that it will work, but as a myth, it will have social power that can be used by those who have wealth and resources to make others believe that to be prenatally genetically modified makes you better. It would be as much a myth as believing that the sperm of a Nobel laureate will give you a genius child.  I am all for human enhancement, but it must start after an egg is fertilized, beginning in utero by protecting the fetus from toxic chemicals and continuing postnatally through environmental, nutritional and cognitive enhancement and moral education.  Enhancement through genetic engineering of human germ plasm is a fool's paradise and will lead to no good.  Thank you. [applause]\", \"Well, that's an all-purpose argument that you can apply for many things.  We have all kind of moral provisions in the United States.  We don't allow the sale of organs.  We restrict certain types of uses of viruses in research.  We prohibit certain experiments with animals that are considered immoral.  We can always use that argument and say somebody will be left behind, but we have to establish moral principles and safety principles that make sense to our scientific community and our general society.\", 'Sharon was mentioned.  I don\\'t know her personally.  And I\\'m so happy that she had a successful pregnancy.  But she had choices.  One of her choices was to adopt someone else\\'s egg and have a baby.  She -- it wouldn\\'t be her DNA but it would be somebody else\\'s DNA.  Another choice would be for her to adopt a child, which, you know, is certainly a desirable thing to do in a world where there are children who need adoption. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - What is the urgency of people to have their DNA in their child?  In fact, most of the things that our children get do not get from our DNA, they get from all the enhancement that we give them, so there\\'s this obsession that \"My child has to have my DNA.\"  She did have some other choices.  The risks that she took were real.', \"We have a very -- we have a very elaborate system in this country of allowing or not allowing people to be involved in clinical trials.  The safety issues that have to be taking care of this, institutional review boards.  Now, if you were a woman who wanted such procedures to be done, one of the first questions you would ask is has this been done within a clinical trial setting, with the government's imprimatur, or is this being done at a hospital that has, really, no accountability to any national bioethics system?  In fact, these experiments were done in violation of a de facto rule by the federal government, because they used private funds. So there is really not a good clinical trial that was used to suggest that these procedures were safe.  There are a lot of risks that these women took.\", 'Exactly.  I was going to leave that for my final comments because I truly was plagued by the mitochondria problem.  I think it is a problem for people who oppose genetically engineering babies because on one hand you feel for people, and you want them to have the best for their lives.  So there has to be a response to the mitochondrial problem or other problems where people have two copies of a diseased gene and cannot use pre-implantation embryo or diagnosis.', 'John, can I just tell the audience --', \"-- what we're dealing with here with the mitochondrial case?  The woman's egg has abnormalities in the cytoplasm.  And the mitochondria is in the cytoplasm.  But her DNA is perfectly normal.  So there's several ways that they deal with it.  They either take her DNA out of her egg and put it into another egg where the DNA has been removed so she'd operating with her DNA in somebody else's mitochondria.  So you have then a child born with the DNA of two women and then one man.  And these interactions between the nucleus DNA and the cytoplasm DNA are totally unknown. Robert Winston: That's right. Sheldon Krimsky: There are other ways to do it.  One way is if you have like rotten milk, you take the milk and divide it in half and then put good milk into it.  You take the cytoplasm from a healthy egg, and you pump it into the abnormal cytoplasm of the abnormal cells so you're pumping in somebody else's DNA into the woman's egg.  And then you have the child with that, hoping that --\", '[inaudible]', \"I think my argument was that any of the factors we think about enhancement are so complex, they involve so many genes, that it would just be unrealistic to think that you can enhance a person by manipulating a few genes here or there. And, plus, we haven't even discussed the epigenome, which are all the switches that turn genes on and off, which are so complex --\", \"If she's saying that there isn't a clear distinction between a medical improvement or medical -- or therapy and enhancement, I actually agree --\", '-- that there is a fuzzy line between enhancement and therapy.', 'Well, yeah.', 'I think that --', \"-- over millions of years, mistakes have been bred out to a great extent.  And it's remarkable how many children are born normally with the billions and billions of biochemical actions that take place from the fertilized egg until the child is born. So a lot of mistakes were bred out of the system, and it's taken millions of years before the human genome has evolved.  Now we're saying, okay, we can get a few technologists to tinker with that and do a better job at the balancing the homeostasis of what I consider an ecosystem, a genetic ecosystem.  And my colleague here has pointed out how many abnormalities occur when these genetic mice are manipulated.\", 'To the women who cannot get the genetic engineering for this problem?', \"Genetic -- genetically modifying human reproductive cells is a totally new frontier.  It has lots of risks, and its risks are not only to the individuals who are involved in it.  Its risks are to the society as a whole or to other societies, a new Hitlerian society that arises. The last thing you want to do is to provide a technology that could be misused by authoritarian societies for their own functions.  And this is a totally novel frontier that we should be extraordinarily cautious about in trying to break through.  We have never done this before.  Those examples that she gave us are very tentative.  They're full of risks.  And if we produce the child that was abnormal, then society would have to deal with it.\", 'Sex is already a form of recreation.', \"The actual -- the issue of genetically modified food's an interesting one because it shows you how you can develop a technology, patent it, and then control it through monopoly control like some of the companies do, so that farmers can't -- [applause] -- farmers cannot even own the seeds or replant the seeds.  I mean, we've seen a system of capitalistic control over seeds that we've never seen before in history.  I don't think this is very desirable for a diverse agricultural system, but we're waiting to see what happens in the future.  No parent of any child will ever control that child.  Take it from me. [laughter] [applause]\", 'You know, we have -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 -', '-- a system of safety on drug safety, for example, in the United States, and you wouldn\\'t expect people to just be taking drugs that have not gone through clinical trials and a government regulatory agency.  And you cannot just go to a company and say, \"I\\'ll be part of your clinical trial,\" unless there\\'s been some approval for that.  Otherwise, their drug would not be accepted by the government.  But yet we\\'ve heard that there were these experiments that were done without any government imprimatur.  We have no idea what the safety controls were in those experiments or how far along in the lifecycle of the child that was born that we have to investigate.  So I think safety is very important, and any society has to set up the standards of safety before they do any kind of test.', \"So it is perfectly understandable why parents would want to provide as much enrichment to their child as possible to ensure their success in life.  But prenatal genetic engineering is not enrichment of a newborn, it is an effort to redesign the human genome.  Science has succeeded in applying genetic modification for enhancement to animals and crops, some would say successfully, others would say the jury is still out. But in the hundreds and thousands of trials that failed.  We simply discard the results of the unwanted crop or animal.  Is this the model that civilized humane society wishes to apply to humans?  Make pinpoint genetic alterations in the human germ plasm and discard the results when they don't work out.  It is sheer hubris to think that manipulating the human germ plasm for enhancement will not produce mistakes. Under our current laws and civil morality, society must bear the expense to care for my severely disabled individual produce the reproductive genetic engineering. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 - I'll leave you with one story.  A little over ten years ago, scientists discovered that by modifying a mouse's gene, it greatly improved the mouse's memory.  Subsequently, they also learned that modification produced a mouse that increased sensitivity to pain. I want to say a word about the mitochondrial disease problem.  Some decisions appear ethical from a pinpoint perspective, but they're clearly unethical from a wider lens.  For this, we have to look at the wider lens of genetic engineering and not at the pinpoint perspective in order to understand its ethics to society.  Thank you.\"]\n",
      "['I would prefer the clarinet, I think. [laughter]', \"Well, Ladies and gentlemen, it's great to hear my partner, Sheldon Krimsky, talking about the sperm of Nobel prizewinners.  We've got Jim Watson in the audience, and it's -- [applause] -- lovely to see him there.\", 'Well, I know --', \"I'm not going to ask whether he's banked any of his sperm.\", \"I'm not going to ask him whether he's banked any of his sperm. [laughter]\", \"And it's the 60th anniversary of your paper coming up, isn't it, on the DNA structure, which is a remarkable landmark.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is actually quite a simple proposition.  And it's quite clear that what our opponents are recommending is something which Americans shiver at, which is experimentation without the consent of the individual being experimented upon. It's worth looking very briefly at American history.  The history of eugenics, which started probably in Britain, with Francis Galton back in the 1850s, is still a scar to some extent on genetics.  And Davenport, of course, and other people who followed him, I think, had a great deal of responsibility for the sterilization of women without consent, with the prevention of people who might want to make love together because they were different races were prevented by law in many states in the United States.  And this is something, of course, which directly influenced the Nazi holocaust. And although it may seem farfetched, it's worth bearing in mind that the time when the planet is oppressed by the risk of global warming, and by the risk of conflict, by the risk of all sorts of serious issues on the economy, it may well be that people might want to Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - see eugenics raising its ugly head again.  And the United States, in my view, as the leading biotechnological country in the world, has a major responsibility to lead it in this ethical issue.  Now, as my partner has said, there are two concerns here.  One is genetic engineering to change horrific genes such as these are mentioned, and the other, of course, is to enhance individuals.  The problem, of course, is that once you go from one, I think you go to the other as well.  And mitochondrial disease, let's just knock that on the head straightaway.  Mitochondrial disease, although it's a terrible thing to have, it is really trivial in terms of its incidence.  It's a very, very uncommon disorder. And it is worrying to me that our opponents have got the numbers wrong.  It isn't 2 percent of the DNA, it's 16,000 base pairs out 3 billion base pairs.  So it's a tiny amount of DNA, but we know already that even fiddling with the mitochondria may make a massive difference to what happens to the nuclear DNA.  It's still not clear.  And it's worth bearing in mind that abnormal children have been born as a result of mitochondrial transfer.  This has been completely unpredictable.  Now, with regard to one of the issues about genetic engineering for enhancement, it will be permanent, it will be irreversible, and it may impart values to a child that, that child might find is not valuable in the society in which they are growing up.  And, of course, with regard to disease, it is quite clear that screening embryos is a much better bet. If we take a cell away or the look at the biochemistry of an embryo, which you can now do, and detect the disease, we can simply substitute that embryo for another one in a clutch of eggs because, of course, a woman -- it's worth bearing in mind that the average childbearing woman watching this program will lose two eggs during the course of the program, each genetically unique.  The males, meanwhile, have made some 70,000 new sperm.  Each of those are equally genetically unique, an every embryo is different.  And therefore, to screen embryos which have a clear disease, by the techniques which are now being developed, is certainly possible and much safer than meddling with the genome. And, of course, what we have to understand is that we now know that the environmental influence on the embryo, the environmental influence on the fetus has a massive point, has a massive change, in how it grows up.  And, in fact, really, what we should be trying to do -- rather than trying to risk making abnormal babies, what we should be trying to do is to improve the environment so that the DNA functions in the best possible way. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - There is a lot of evidence to show that a woman can change the cognitive ability, the intelligence of her fetus, by what she eats in pregnancy, what happens to her stress hormones in pregnancy, and this research is burgeoning.  And that is something which we should really recognize in a democratic society as something that science should really concentrate on. Now, the big problem of course is that genetic engineering is unpredictable.  And I'm going to give you two examples from the two biggest users of people who make genetically modified animals.  The most common place for genetically modified animals, of course, is in the pharmaceutical industry.  Pretty well every drug is now tested -- nearly every drug will be tested on animals, where their genes have been modified to make a model for human disease or to look at the action of that drug.  And if you look at the figures which are being published by two of the largest companies in the world, with very large series of mass models, you can see the problem you'd have with genetic engineering. AstraZeneca published 51 different models, a vast number of mice in those models, 70 percent, ladies and gentlemen, of those animals were abnormal and the abnormality was unpredictable.  Some of the abnormalities were trivial, others were not.  The animals were not followed up for long term, they were simply discarded, so we don't know what would have happened to -- in old age.  We do know that changing genetics makes a difference to what happens to us in our old age, and certainly the fetal origins of adult disease are very important.  We know, for example, that stroke, diabetes, some cancers, may be caused by what happens in the environment of an embryo early on. And Pfizer has gone even further.  It's looked at 74 different tests on mice that are bred after genetic modification, and 50 percent of the mice failed the phenotype test.  And this is without, of course, testing the very things for which we would want to enhance people, i.e., intelligence and their ability to solve a problem. So let's just say one other thing, if I may, and that is that one of the problems, of course, is that one may modify genes, but we don't even know whether they will continue to function in the way.  And there is a lot of evidence from the work we do in my own laboratory, which shows that gene expression in a modified animal stops after a while during development.  Ladies and gentlemen, as I say, you have a responsibility here. You have a duty to lead the world to make certain that your medicine is ethical.  Thank you.\", \"Well, it's nice to be able to answer Nita firsthand, because, of course, I happen to be a member of the British Parliament, the upper house, and we voted overwhelmingly to abolish the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority because it's useless.  And actually it's inhibited research.  It's not a very good way of regulating.  So I don't think you should hold up the British model.  What is needed actually -- what I think is needed is a consensus amongst all of us that we act as far as we can ethically and in the best interest of patients, whatever that might mean.\", 'I --', \"I think it was a very clear distinction, and I think the other side are absolutely right to concentrate on genetic abnormalities because, of course, gene defects are appalling. They are amongst the worst kinds of diseases that people have.  Children in the main die of genetic defects.  A few of them like mitochondrial diseases don't always kill people but they often have major effects on the central nervous system.  They're deeply unpleasant, and there's no question that if we could avoid these diseases, if we could prevent them or treat them more effectively, we should do so.\", \"But I think the problem really is that, first of all, there will be enhancement.  And I think that's risky.  And the difficulty really is that in preventing one genetic disease, you're likely, very likely, to cause another genetic disease. The fact, of course, is that we now know that there are only 20,000 genes in the human genome, but there's a huge amount happening outside the genome which is of vital importance.

The very few experiments done in animals on mitochondria, but one that stands out in my mind is a thing called the PEPCK mouse. PEPCK mouse whose mitochondria have been modified, runs 20 times further than a normal mouse and is much more athletic.  It turned out completely unpredictable because it has really strange fertility disorders.  It has a very weird metabolism.  And above all, it's much more aggressive than other mice.  It's not one that you'd want to have in your kitchen. [laughter]\", \"Well, let's wait and see the results of the trial, shall we?  I suspect that we might find some surprises as we have with every one of these other trials.

There are particular issues which do change gene function; we know, for example, that embryo freezing on rare occasions changes gene function.  We published that from my own laboratory, demonstrating that a cancer suppressing gene is suppressed in its action after routine freezing.  We also know from animal studies in mice and rats, that there may be an increased risk of demyelination; that is, a form of ME in the brain in some animals that have had a cell removed.  Now, I have to say that these things have to be much more carefully validated. The problem really is, with in vitro fertilization, it's probably rather like meddling with a genome: most of the time, it might well be quite safe.  And I would not want people to go away from here thinking that IVF is a horrible thing to do for a child, it clearly isn't. But the full consequences of in vitro fertilization cannot be known for a very long time ahead.  It's well worth putting your -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -\", \"Just one point.

Actually -- [applause] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 - There really -- there really is an issue.  You're quite right, this technology is expensive, it would cost tens of thousands of dollars, perhaps even -- maybe even $100,000 to start with.  But actually caring for a child that's got a serious genetic disorder is far more expensive.  And, of course, the expense of that care is not only the expense, the money, but also the tragedy, the distress, the pain, and all the rest of it.  So I think we have to be careful and cautious about the financial arguments, and I'm sure that Lee and Nita would agree with me.\", \"Ladies and gentlemen, don't be seduced by a single, very heartrending story.  That is really not at issue here.  There's a big issue for the whole of our society and for people in general.  I regret to say that I'm saddened to see the simplistic argument about mitochondrial DNA from the other side.  We don't understand the interactions with the mitochondria.  And already we've seen a number of horrid mishaps.  So, of course, maybe a particular individual was lucky, but they might have been unlucky.  How different we would have been then.  We heard that people have a right to have a healthy child.  Of course, they don't have a right, sadly, to have a healthy child.  What we do have a right to, though, in a democratic society, surely, is to have access to the best and the safest treatment.  And at the moment, the safest treatment is certainly not meddling with the genome.  It is not meddling with the mitochondrial DNA. It is actually to look at every other way of dealing with these terrible diseases.  We're not ready for it.  Of course, at the moment, I have no doubt it shall be banned.  Bans can always be lifted if there's more research done to show that it is worth doing.  And it's worth bearing in mind too that we're not going to eradicate genetic defects by doing this, not remotely.  New defects occur all the time as Lee Silver rightly points out.  All of us have defective DNA.  30 percent of boys born with the male form of muscular dystrophy have this as a new mutation, as he well knows.  No amount of pre- implantation diagnosis will have changed that.  It is a particular problem.  And that is always going to be the issue here.  The question is how we deal with these diseases actually when we have them. And finally, can I just say, on a very personal note, it really is -- and I don't mean this patronizingly.  It's wonderful to see young people in the audience, and it's great to see you here.  Thank you very much for sitting so patiently during these arguments.

      "[\"Well, they were helpful.  I think it was just sort of a combination of gratitude and fear. They were grateful that we just knocked off one of their two principal regional rivals, which was the Taliban, and they were fearful that they might be next.  And so it was a combination.  It was also a different Iranian government than the one we have today; it was a reformist regime operating within an environment that limited their powers but not limited to the point they couldn't reach out.  It was a genuine opportunity that we flubbed.  I'm not going to argue tonight that we still have that opportunity.\", 'Excuse me, I thought I was finished.  Yes, Reuven Pedatzur.', \"Well, just to remind us what we're debating about.  The proposition is, can Israel live with a nuclear Iran, can Israel survive a nuclear Iran.  The answer to that question is yes. You don't need to be absolutely certain it will survive.  In fact, technically, you don't even think it has to be probable that it'll survive, just that it's possible that it will survive. And I think both of the opposition will acknowledge that it's possible it'll survive.  And Jeff said that they'd have a hard time, which implicitly indicates that there's a good possibility they'd survive it, it'd just be harder.  But -- so I mean, I think if you debate at that level, it's pretty clear.  There's almost nobody who thinks that Israel's demise will be automatic and certain.  It's a question of risk.  And so I think in a sense, the real debate is, should Israel live with a nuclear Iran.  And the answer is, not if they can help it, obviously.  Nobody thinks a nuclear Iran is a good idea. And we're already doing a lot to try to prevent it.  We have a massive probably unprecedented international sanctions regime, an active, if so far unproductive diplomatic process, a very active and somewhat successful covert sabotage effort and Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - cyber attacks.  Now, these may work in some combination.  But I'd have to acknowledge that they may not. And so the remaining question is, should one of these fail, go to war to prevent Israel -- prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon.  And I think although that's not precisely what we're debating, the issue does tend to revolve around that.  Now, the threshold for saying yes that we should go to war to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon really has to go -- there are two thresholds, one is efficacy, and one is unintended consequences.  You need to look at both. In terms of efficacy, I think most experts believe that an Israeli attack on Iran would set the program back by perhaps two years.  That an American attack would be more effective and would set it back by maybe four or five years.  It wouldn't prevent it, but it would slow it down.  What about the unintended consequences?  Well, most people are concerned about the possibility of counter attacks.  Iran begins rocketing Israel -- Israeli nuclear facilities, terrorist attacks.  But in many ways, the more dangerous response is, first of all, that an unprovoked attack on Iran validates their case for a nuclear weapon, for nuclear deterrence.   North Korea doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks.  Pakistan doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks.  And many in the world and in Iran will come around to the view that maybe Iran actually needs a nuclear weapon. A second consequence is that you begin to collapse the international coalition that so far has made Iran a pariah state that has cut off its access to international markets, international -- not just nuclear technology, but any kind of military technology, and increasingly even cut back dramatically its oil sales.  And as a result, Iran gains access to the world economy.  It breaks out of its isolation.  And even perhaps certainly gains access to sophisticated military technology.  In the aftermath of an attack, wouldn't Russia be prepared to sell Iran the kind of air defense systems which so far it's refused to sell Iran and perhaps even nuclear technology from states like Pakistan or others, North Korea. I think in evaluating these consequences, one has to go back to the question of what is it that we, and for that matter, most Israelis, fear about Iran.  And I think Jeff has pretty much answered that question.  It's not Iranian invasion.  It's Iranian subversion.  It's Iran's capacity to appeal to militant elements within neighboring populations, dissident elements within neighboring populations in order to galvanize their efforts both against their own regimes in many cases and against Israel.  So it's Iranian influence; it's Iranian capacity for subversion.  It's not that Iran is going to march across two intervening states Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - and invade Israel.  That is a concern.  And the fear is that they would be emboldened, and they'd do more of this. But I think you have to ask yourself, which kind of Iran would have more influence with these dissident populations?  Not with governments, but with dissident populations in places like Gaza and Lebanon and other Middle East states.  An Iran that had nuclear weapons, or an Iran that was the victim of an unprovoked attack?  Which of those two would give Iran greater influence and capacity to mobilize those kinds of populations?  I think the answer to that is fairly clear.  Now, the argument that Iran would be emboldened by possessing a nuclear weapon is certainly, I think, a real danger.  But it's far from a certainty.  It's not the historic pattern.  You know, our major problems with the Soviet Union and particularly with China occurred before they had nuclear weapons. You know, Soviet Union gobbled up all of Eastern Europe before it had nuclear weapons. We had nuclear weapons, they didn't.  China actually attacked the United States and Korea and made [unintelligible] a two-year war with the United States and Korea.  They didn't have nuclear weapons; we did.  Once they got nuclear weapons, we didn't have anymore wars.  Now, we had lots of confrontations, but they were eventually defused. Both North Korea and Pakistan do behave irresponsibly on occasion, but there is a certain stability in their relations with India, Pakistan's relations with India, North Korea's relations with South Korea.  There haven't been conflicts in either case.  So the argument that they'd be emboldened to the point of actually threatening to use nuclear weapons or using nuclear weapons or even engaging in the kind of behavior that they're not engaging in now -- and I think if you listen to Jeff's list of all the things they're doing, you'd have to ask, what the hell else could they do that they're not already doing?  And I think the answer is not much.\", \"Well, I don't think the Israeli counterstrike is vulnerable.  I mean, Israelis have nuclear weapons that can't be located, can't be destroyed.\", 'And so I think that launch on warning is not a necessary strategy for the Israelis.  It might --', 'I think they would -- I mean, it would obviously depend on the circumstances.  If they thought --', \"You know, the United States was just as vulnerable as Israel.  We had 24,000 nuclear Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 - weapons locked in on us.  They would have damaged us just as badly as half a dozen on Israel.  The result would have been the same.  And it probably would have been worse for the rest of the world; indeed it would have been catastrophic for the world as a whole. And we lived with that for 40 years.  And all of these problems with launch on warning -- now, I quite take the fact that these regimes don't have the controlled mechanisms, the command and control or even the technologies that will make this a safer world.  And so I fully acknowledge that there's an element of risk there.  I fully acknowledge that Israel shouldn't live with a nuclear Iran if there's a better option.  I'm just arguing that there may not be a better option.\", \"I mean, I think what -- a benign explanation, and I'm not arguing that one should necessarily accept the benign explanation, is that the Iranians are simply arguing for a Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 - multi-ethnic state, encompassing all of historic Israel, to include the West Bank, which is the Hamas position, for instance.  It's not that the Israelis should go away.  It's that Israel should go away and that a multi-ethnic state encompassing both Palestinians and Israelis should continue to exist.  Interestingly enough, there are extremists, but viable parties in Israel who also think that the Israeli state should encompass all of the West Bank.\", 'The difference is that they think it should be a Jewish state, whereas the Iranians would argue it should be a multi-ethnic state.', \"I mean, quoting from extremist websites is one thing, but as far as I know, the largest Jewish population in the Middle East that doesn't live in Israel lives in Iran. Male Speaker: The largest what [inaudible]?

There was one option that the United States would lose if Iran had a nuclear weapon, which it's lost with respect to North Korea, and that is to invade and overthrow the regime.  That would be off the table.  We might do other things to them.  We've got 5,000 nuclear weapons.  They've got two or three. There's almost nothing we could do to them, short of threatening to overthrow the regime, which would cause them to use their nuclear weapons.  And I think Israel has never had the capacity of invading and overthrowing the regime, and Israel's not going to use its nuclear weapons to respond to rocket attacks from Hamas. It's got other conventional responses to that which it can fall back on whether Iran has nuclear weapons or not.  And Iran is not going to start a nuclear war to protect Hamas.\", \"We're not arguing that it's impossible. [talking simultaneously] Male Speaker: Yeah, I'm not going to argue it's impossible -- James Dobbins: There's no historic -- there's no historic example of successful compellence since 1945.

I mean, history --', 'A remote possibility?', \"There's no automaticity to the --\", \"There's no automaticity to the idea that Iran's gaining nuclear weapons is going to proliferate.  It's a risk, like these other things.  And it's a risk that the U.S. takes seriously, which is one of the reasons why it's threatened to bomb Iran.  It's not as if there's a gulf between the Israeli leadership and the leadership in Washington; they both agree that they should bomb Iran rather than allow it to have nuclear weapons, they just disagree about when. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 -\", \"The United States had a peer competitor that had in many cases, more nuclear weapons than we did.  People invested.  We had huge immigration.

And yet it hasn't behaved irresponsibly in the sense of doing anything that endangers its existence.  The regime has done lots of outrageous things.  But none of them threatened its existence.  None of them threatened the continuity of the regime.  Iran in fact hasn't invaded anybody for 500 years.  So it's not as if they have territorial claims. They're promoting subversion.  They're promoting overthrow of hostile regimes. They're engaging in terrorism.  And I would anticipate that they would continue to do so.  At no point has either American or Israeli nuclear weapons deterred them from that.  I don't think there's any level of that that they could engage in that would result in a nuclear strike on our part.  And therefore, I don't think that their having nuclear weapons would particularly affect that kind of behavior, which would -- we would continue to have to respond to forcefully at times and certainly rigorously.  But I don't think it would be notably harder.\", \"And as far as Islam and the Arab world, or for that matter in the South Asian world, I don't know that it's particularly, you know, relevant to this problem.

It might have some short-term psychological impact, but it -- you know, I mean, the  United States successfully waged a war that got -- that three the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan employing Pakistani and Afghan surrogates.

I would certainly acknowledge that the risk of miscalculation and a nuclear exchange is higher if the countries have nuclear weapons than if they don't.  It's high enough to be very concerned about.  And so, going back to my proposition, Israel shouldn't have to live with a nuclear Iran if it has a better choice.  I'm just arguing that there aren't better choices necessarily than those that we're already pursuing.  I mean, I will get into whether it's relevant or not, but a whole literature on the concepts of deterrence, on means of deterrence, on mutual signaling, on avoiding escalatory instability by making sure that you weren't subject to a first strike, and thus tempting your adversary to make that first strike in rising tensions. There are ways that one can minimize the risk of escalation by the way one constructs and hides and disposes of one's nuclear forces.  There are technical ways that one can avoid unauthorized use of these kinds of weapons.  And there's a long history of literature on that.  The United States, for instance, has sought to help Pakistan establish physical mechanisms and procedures that would make an unauthorized or accidental launch of a nuclear weapon more difficult.  I'm not suggesting we necessarily get into such a relationship with Iran, but we might hope someone did.\", \"Well, I'm old enough to remember when in elementary school we were taught to hide under our desks under nuclear attack.\", \"Duck and cover.  And, you know, sirens would go off, and we would hide under our desks, so, you know, some level of fear and concern is natural enough in a society that Intelligence Squared U.S. - 59 - faces that kind of threat.  And if you can avoid the threat, by all means, do so if you have a better choice.  We didn't have a better choice at the time.  Reuven has suggested that a nuclear Iran will not be the end of the Jewish state.  And I'd have to say most Israelis agree with him.  The Times of Israel published a poll last week, a poll done in the context of their election campaign, in which they asked the Israeli populace what were the issues that most -- that created most anxiety, what were they most worried about.  Was Iran the number one issue?  No.  Economic issues were their dominant concern.  Was Iran the number two issue?  No. Actually, and perhaps rather healthily, the deterioration in relations with the Palestinians was the number two concern.  Was Iran the number three concern?  No. The third concern was the state of their education system.  Iran was the fourth in this list of six, with 12 percent of the Israeli population thinking that the Iranian threat was their principal concern.\"]\n",
      "[\"There was no reaction whatsoever, because you should know that in Israel there are no public debates on nuclear issues; it's taboo, so there was no reaction. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 -\", 'The same.', \"You know [unintelligible] Israel eye would like to know what's in Netanyahu's head. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - [laughter]\", 'Good evening.  Where are the results?  No results yet?  Anyway, can Israel live with a nuclear Iran?  The short answer is yes.  Any questions? [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - Okay.  But the real question is not this one.  The real question, do we have another choice?  And unfortunately, the answer is no.  Because it\\'s possible, despite all pressures and sanctions and even if there will be an Israeli military attack that in this decade, Iran will have nuclear weapons. So the question is for the Israeli policymakers, what then?  What will be our policy in this case when Iran will have the weapons?  Unfortunately there is -- as I said, there are no public debates on this, so we don\\'t know what they think over there about future policy.  What should Israel do when there will be a hostile Iran with nuclear weapons? The most effective and maybe the only way to deter Iran is to abandon our ambiguity, nuclear ambiguity and to move towards unconcealed nuclear deterrence.  And since, in Israel, we have censorship, as you know, I have to play the game.  And when I refer to Israeli nuclear deterrence, Israeli nuclear weapons, Israeli nuclear submarines with nuclear missiles, it\\'s all according to foreign sources.  I don\\'t know anything.  And I have to use this phrase, \"according to foreign sources.\" But Israel has to change its policy and to move, as I say, to nuclear deterrence -- with new rules of the game.  And the other side should know what are the rules of the game. There will be red lines so the Iranians will understand it.  For example, if Israel will detect a ballistic missile launched in Iran going westerly, for Israel, it will be the nuclear missiles.  And in this case, Israel will not wait to see whether it is a nuclear missile or not.  Automatically Israel will launch its nuclear missiles, according to foreign sources, and it, Tehran-- [unintelligible], it\\'s fine and so on and so on.  And it should be clear for the other side what will happen. And then the Ayatollahs in Tehran will have to decide whether to launch their missiles when they know exactly what will happen.  What will happen, that Iran will be destroyed, and we\\'ll go back to the Middle Ages.  And I don\\'t see any Iranian national interests that justifies this cost.  So I believe that we can deter them. I believe that the other team will use the argument of irrationality.  We cannot deter these extremist Muslim Ayatollahs.  And if this is the case, we cannot deter them, then Netanyahu is right, and we have to attack. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - But I don\\'t think this is the case, because if we have a very clear policy of nuclear deterrence, then the chances that the other side will use the weapons are very slim or not existent.  For this, we\\'ll have to change not just the policy.  We have to show and declare our second-strike capability in order to show the Iranians what we have.  And again, according to foreign sources, we have submarines, dolphin class with nuclear missiles.  So we have second-strike capability, probably. So when they use the argument of irrationality, everybody goes to the Cold War and say the Ayatollahs are not like the leaders of the two super powers.  They are not rational. They are not going to act like the Soviet leaders or the American leaders, which is wrong, I believe, because if you can remember, during the Cold War, Stalin was perceived, even in the states, as a madman -- whenever he has the bomb he is going to drop the bomb.  And the Ayatollahs are not like this.  And it seems from professional and sober analysis that the Iranians will -- if we\\'ll learn their way of thinking, their culture, their history, they are going to act like real rational leaders. We should understand that the development of the Iranian nuclear weapons is not against Israel.  It\\'s based on their experience during the war, the Iran-Iraq war in the \\'80s, not against Israel.  And it\\'s very important to understand it, what is the base of their thinking about their nuclear program.

      "[\"I'm eager.\", \"Do you think that's provocative?\", 'Well, I think provoking people and ridicule and satire is incredibly important in the world today.  Nothing should be above ridicule because it gets people to think and least of all, religion.', 'Michael Shermer.', 'Yeah, you bet.  You can take all the time you want. [laughter]', 'Thank you.  I actually wore this t-shirt for the subject of the debate.  And it\\'s the center of the debate.  And it\\'s clear.  The motion is science refutes God.  And Michael and I have the distinct advantage here of arguing in favor of the motion because in fact we have evidence, reason, logic, rationality, and empirical methods on our side, whereas the opponents have vague hopes and fears, and they\\'re arguing in favor of a motion that\\'s hanging on for its existence by mere shreds of emotional and ideological spaghetti, much like this type provided by the flying spaghetti monster, one of the equally irrational gods which science provides no support for. But I first want to begin by clarifying the nature of the motion, because the motion isn\\'t science disproves God.  It\\'s science Refutes God.  And that\\'s very important because you can\\'t disprove a notion that\\'s basically vague and unfalsifiable.  I could not -- there\\'s no way to disprove the notion that God didn\\'t create all of us 15 seconds ago with the memories of the amusing comments we heard before that.  There\\'s no way we can disprove that, okay.  And that\\'s really important to recognize that those kind of unfalsifiable notions are unfalsifiable, as I say.  But we can ask, is it rational to expect that that\\'s likely.  And tonight I want to emphasize that 500 years of science have demonstrated that God, that vague notion, is not likely.  It\\'s irrational to believe in God. Now, to refute God means refuting several claims.  Onethat are all based on faith, not evidence.  One, that God is necessary, two, that there is evidence for God; and three, that that belief is rational.  And the point is that the progress of science has shown over and over and over again that the answers to all those three questions are no.  No, no, no.  Now, my own scientific field is cosmology.  And that\\'s the study of the origin and evolution of the universe as a whole.  And it\\'s where science and religion sort of confront each other.  And creation myths have abounded throughout human history, and science confronts those creation myths.  And we\\'ll talk about that, I\\'m sure, at some point in the debate.  But I want to point out that our opponents, I\\'m pretty sure, are Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - going to argue first that one aspect of science that supports perhaps the belief in God is this notion that the universe is apparently fine-tuned for life.  I hear that a lot, and because it was fine-tuned so life could exist.  That is a remarkable and, in fact, cosmic misunderstanding, because it\\'s the same kind of misunderstanding that led people to believe in special creation for life on earth before Darwin. It looked like everything was designed for the environment in which it lived.  But what Darwin showed us was that a simple proposition, namely that there\\'s genetic variation among a population combined with natural selection meant that you didn\\'t need supernatural shenanigans, that in fact all the diversity of life on earth could arise from a single life form, by natural law.  And he didn\\'t know -- what he showed was it was plausible, based on the evidence -- he didn\\'t know about DNA.  He didn\\'t know about the details of genetic replication, but he showed it was plausible.  And as I\\'ll say, that\\'s where we\\'re at now as far as the understanding of the universe is concerned.  Now, our -- my opponents, I suspect, will argue the universe is equally fine-tuned for life, and they -- in fact, they will point out that certain fundamental parameters in nature, if they were different, we couldn\\'t exist. Or they may boldly assert that, in fact, certain of these parameters are so strange and unnatural that they must have been established with malice aforethought to ensure our existence.  This too is an illusion.  Just as bees need to see the color of flowers but they\\'re not designed to do it, if they couldn\\'t see them, they couldn\\'t get the nectar and reproduce.  So what we\\'re seeing is a version of cosmic natural selection.  We would be quite surprised to find ourselves living in a universe in which we couldn\\'t live.  In fact, that might be evidence for God. [laughter] But I want to point out that in fact the universe isn\\'t particularly fine-tuned or conducive to life.  Most of the universe is rather inhospitable to life.  And in fact -- perhaps the biggest fine-tuning problem in my own field of cosmology, something I\\'m, in fact, very proud to have proposed in a sense is that the energy of empty space is not zero.  The weirdest thing you can imagine, that empty space weighs something, but remarkably the energy of empty space is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than we would navely predict. And if it were much bigger than we measure, it\\'s true that galaxies couldn\\'t form, and planets couldn\\'t form, and Intelligence Squared Debates couldn\\'t happen.  So the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - universe appears to be here because Intelligence Squared is here.  Now, that suggests religion perhaps, but the point is not that that claim of fine tuning is ridiculous because, in fact, if the energy of empty space was zero, which is a -- by far a more natural value, the universe would be a better place for life to live in.  We all thought it was zero when I was a graduate student, because that was a natural value.  If it was zero, the universe would be a better place.  In fact, you can show the value that it has now makes the universe the worst of all possible universes to live in for the future of life.  So, so much for a universe created for us. [laughter] Now, once Darwin had removed the apparent need for God in evolution of life, the last bastion for God was the creation of the universe, how you can get something from nothing.  And what -- we\\'re in a remarkable situation of being in is precisely the same situation that Darwin existed in 150 years ago, namely, we have a plausible explanation of how a universe could precisely come from nothing. If you asked, \"What would be the characteristics of the universe that came from nothing by natural laws?\" it would be precisely the characteristics of the universe we observe, and it didn\\'t have to be that way.  It could have been another way.  And by nothing -- and it -- the -- my opponents will say that by nothing, I\\'m not talking about nothing, but I\\'m talking about nothing, no particles, no radiation, no space, no time, and even no laws of physics.  Our -- [unintelligible] my opponents might argue that the multiverse, which our universe might have spontaneously been created in, was created by physicists because they don\\'t like God, because it\\'s eternal and exists outside our universe, those same characteristics that God is supposed to have.  But it wasn\\'t created because we don\\'t like God, although I don\\'t like God.  It was -- we\\'d been driven to it by measurements.  In fact, I don\\'t even like the multiverse, but I\\'ve learned to force my beliefs to conform to the evidence of reality. That\\'s where science differs from religion.  There do remain deep philosophical and seismic questions that are unanswered, but God is not required or useful to explain any of them.  And, therefore, to conclude, science has taught us that we don\\'t need God to create a universe, that there\\'s no evidence for God, that the specific sides of the claims of those who require God disagree with empirical evidence, and it\\'s irrational.  Science refutes God, so clearly you should vote for our side.  Thank you.', \"That's ridiculous. [laughter] In fact, it's ridiculous to the science that you do.  When you do science, you're presuming that the results of an experiment in your laboratory apply in another laboratory. The fundamental claim that -- if you just -- miracles in your particular religion -- it's kind of remarkable that these violations of the laws of nature only occurred before video cameras and Intelligence Squared and the internet, and that you have these remarkable violations of the laws of nature in a book, which I was really surprised to hear Dinesh call a scientific document, the bible.   I hope he really didn't mean that.  St. Augustine would be very upset with you, because he said the Bible wasn't scientific.

But you use the keyword, \"experience.\"  We wait then for an experience that contradicts the known laws.  So if tonight when I looked up at the sky, the stars rearranged themselves that I am here in Aramaic or ancient Greek or whatever you want, then I might say, you know, there\\'s something to it.

Science determines the consequences of your Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 - actions.  So a precursor to determining to what's right or wrong is to know how the world really works. For example, if you thought the person was pushed on the train would be hit by the train and then get up and walk away, you'd have very different actions.  And so that's what I mean by ultimately understanding how the universe works as a precursor to making decisions to making moral decisions.\", \"And the point is when you say the experience, you mean a personal -- some internal perception that God exists.  And -- and the fact that something is maybe relatively universal suggests that we may be programmed to believe in certain things.  But it doesn't mean -- because that doesn't mean they exist just because as Michael was talking about earlier, our evolutional history programs us to have certain tendencies. And there's no doubt -- you'd be crazy to suggest that humans don't have a tendency to be religious.  That would violate evidence of reality.  So the fact that humans have a tendency to be religious is not -- or a belief in God is not proof that God exists.  It's just proof that humans have a tendency.\", \"As I said, in science we talk about likely and unlikely.  In science, of course, and in life, we do, I agree, make decisions based on incomplete evidence.  But the wonderful thing about science, the thing that makes science so much better than religion is our faith is shakable.  I am proud of the fact that there's something I can believe with all my heart to be absolutely true and the minute there's a bit of evidence that shows it isn't true, I throw it out like yesterday's newspaper.  In fact, that's the one thing I recommend, I hope every student has in their experiences sometime in their life, something that they profoundly believe in to be true based on faith shown to be wrong because that opens their mind.  And that's what science does that religion doesn't. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 56 -\", 'Human beings were clearly programmed by evolution to impute intentionality to the world around them.  Meaning and purpose was infused in all everyday events to make sense of a dangerous, difficult, and uncaring world, so we had rituals behind the sun, the moon, the planets, the wind, the earth, the oceans, in all societies.  The rise of our physical understanding has slowly caused us to do away with those many gods; we no longer have Mars, the god of war, Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, Thor, the god of storms.  As Michael has said, everyone here, or maybe everyone, is now an atheist with respect to those gods, and there\\'s a reason for that.  Science has taught us that instead of capricious beings, there\\'s an order to nature, and that order does not appear to involve a divinity. There\\'s no need for a divinity; laws of nature describable bymathematics make predictions that allow us to -- not only to predict the future, but control it, without the need for any supernatural shenanigans.  And, in fact, it amazes me that asking the question, \"Is God necessary?\" is somehow an evil thing.  When we stop asking questions, that will be an evil thing.  Science has taught us also that we want to believe, in the words of Fox Mulder. [laughter] And we should be skeptical of those desires.  As the physicist Richard Feynman told us, the easiest people to fool are ourselves.  As scientist, we have to train ourselves to be skeptical of wanting to believe.  And we should try and overcome our natural tendency to assume special significance to events.  And human being are also inevitably programmed to ask, \"Why?\" as we\\'ve heard it.  But the \"Why?\" question is ill-posed, because it presumes purpose; it presumes the answer to the question before you ask the question. What if there is no purpose?  Does there need to be purpose?  And science tells us there\\'s no evidence of purpose.  So the \"Why?\" question is ill-posed.  Our opponents want to keep the clock from ticking by avoiding the evidence of reality; and, therefore, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 60 - science, by telling us there\\'s no need for purpose, has refuted the need for God, and that\\'s why you should support our position.

      "[\"Well, I'd be happy to talk to her about it for you if you like, but -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 -\", 'Well, I was a born-again Evangelical.  I went knocking on doors to doors to tell people about Jesus.  And then later when I became a born-again atheist, I went back to those same houses and knocked on their doors I was wrong.', \"Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm going to start off with a thought experiment.  Imagine you're a hominid on the plains of Africa 3.5 million years ago.  You're a tiny little Australopithecus afarensis, little brain.  Your name is Lucy.  Thank you.  A lot of people in the Midwest don't get that. [laughter] Evolution, what?  Not that Lucy, the other one.  And you hear a rustle in the grass.  Is it a dangerous predator, or is it just the wind?  If you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator, and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made a type one error in cognition.  A false positive.  You thought the wind was connected to something, and it wasn't.  A was connected to B, and it wasn't.  So that's a false positive.  But that's relatively harmless.  But if you think that the rustle in the grass is just the wind, and it turns out it's a dangerous predator, you're lunch.  Congratulations.  You've just been given a Darwin award for taking yourself out of the gene pool early before reproducing. And we are the descendants of those who are most likely to make type one errors, false-positives, versus type two errors, false-negatives.  That is to say, why can't you just Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - stay in the grass and collect enough data to get the answer right?  And the answer is that predators don't wait around for prey animals to collect more data.  That's why they stalk and sneak up on their prey animals, so they can't get enough data. So we evolve the propensity to make snap decisions and make one kind of error more likely than another kind of error.  And that kind of error, that false positive, that's superstition.  That's magical thinking.  That's assuming A is connected to B.  It's a true pattern, and it isn't, and you're wrong.  That's the basis of finding false patterns like gods.  Now, what's the difference between the wind and a dangerous predator?  The wind is an inanimate force.  A dangerous predator is an intentional agent.  And his intention is to eat me, and that can't be good.  So what we also do in addition to finding these meaningful patterns is infuse in them agency.  That is, it's alive.  It's real, it has intention, and its intention is not good, so I better assume it's real.  And this is the basis of animism and spiritism and polytheism and monotheism and the belief in angels and aliens and demons and spirits and poltergeists and gods. Gods are invisible agents who run the world, who control things, who create these patterns, who are these patterns that we use to explain things.  All cultures everywhere in the world have created god beliefs.  Gods with these intentional -- that are intentional agents.  So my question tonight is not like in my book, why do so many people believe in God, here is a theory, which I just outlined for you. But for tonight, I want to ask, what's more likely, that our opponents here happen to pick the right God and the right religion among all the -- about 10,000 different religions and about a thousand different gods the humans have constructed socially, anthropologically, psychologically in the last 10,000 years.  10,000 different religions, a thousand different gods. Our opponents agree with us that 999 of those gods are false gods.  They are atheists like we are atheists.  What I'm asking you to do is just go one God further with us. [laughter] So here's what happened.  About 5,000 to 7,000 years ago, these small bands of hunter- gathers began to coalesce into chiefdoms and states.  As long as the numbers are small, informal means of behavior control and moral enforcement operate quite well.  As soon as the numbers are too large for these informal means, shunning, making people feel guilty, gossiping about them, making them feel embarrassed for their bad behavior, as Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - soon as the population are big, there's too much opportunity for free riding and for cheating the system and taking advantage of it and getting away with it. So two institutions evolved, government to set up a set of rules, and everybody gets a copy; and religion in case you think you got away with it, you didn't because there's an eye in the sky that those all and sees all and keeps track of this.  So this is the second part of how humans construct religions and gods, because we need it for moral enforcement.  It just so happens, by contingency and chance, religion and government was the first on the scene. Now, what's happened in the last several centuries, since the enlightenment, in addition to the trajectory that professor Krauss outlined for you, science displacing religion as the primary means of explaining how the world works, something else has also happened. We've slowly but ineluctably replaced religion as the primary source of our morals and came up with the clever idea that you actually have to have a reason why you have certain moral principles, and we're going to write certain laws.  You actually have to give evidence for why you think this is a good law or a bad law or a good moral principle or a bad moral principle. And that has been the trajectory of the enlightenment since about 200 years ago.  And so again, what's more likely, that one of them happens to be the one true religion, and the one true God, and all those others that have been constructed are false gods or that, as we can clearly see, anthropologically, socially, psychologically and so on, this is what people do to get along.  They construct religions.  They construct moral systems and so on.  We now know that we can do this without gods.  In fact, we do it quite well without gods.  Northern European countries do just fine with much lower rates of religiosity than we have.  It is possible to do it, and that is what we've been doing. Now, I want to finish with just one comment on the resurrection since Ian brought that up.  Let me just -- leaving aside the scientific evidence for this, just think about what it is that is being said here.  They are monotheists.  They believe that there's just one God and that Jesus is God manifest on earth.  And he is your savior, and you accept him for redeeming us for sins we never committed.  Somebody else in the past committed them.  So as I understand this, God sacrifices himself to himself to save us from himself. If that sounds as incomprehensible to you as it does to me, I urge to you vote for our side.  Thank you. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - [applause]\", \"Right.  So like a popular thing in Skeptic magazine, there's psychics and people that can Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 - telekinetically move objects with their mind or so on.  And there's an example of this where there's a man who can move the cursor on his computer just by thinking about it. Now, it turns out he's a quadriplegic, and he has a chip in his brain that enables him to do this.  But if you don't know about the chip, it looks like a miracle.  Once you know the technology, it's no longer miraculous.  This is Arthur C. Clarke's third law.  Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  I contend that there's no such thing as the supernatural or the paranormal.  There's just the natural, the normal and the stuff we haven't explained yet.  And when something unusual like that happens, we should go searching for the mechanism behind it.  Is there a chip in the brain?  So if it's true that, say, God heals cancers or whatever due to prayer, this should be a measurable thing because this is what we --\", 'Okay.  Fine, fine, fine.', \"But even so, even if there was one, aren't you curious as a scientist how God performed the miracle, what forces of nature she used and so on to make it happen?\", 'Thank you.', \"Let's say, Ian, that petitionary prayer actually works.  Again, as a physicist --\", \"Petitioning to the deity to, say, cure my cancer or whatever.  And it happens.  Wouldn't you be curious to know how the deity or whatever it is reaches into the world, stirs the particles, reconfigures the DNA so the cancer cells quit replicating so rapidly and so on. And the moment you figure that out as a scientist, it would no longer be a miracle.  It wouldn't be supernatural.  It would just be part of nature.  It's like, so if I recant this prayer six times between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m., this is the effect.  It's a measurable, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 - determined thing.  That's just now incorporated as part of science.\", \"Well, so where do we get our morals from?  It can't be from the Bible because almost nobody obeys certainly not the Old Testament.  And most of the New Testament-- I mean, death penalty for adultery, there goes half of Congress.  I mean, nobody -- [laughter] -- nobody is going to do this, right?  So we pick and choose.  We cherry pick from the Holy Book based on something else, something else that's happened that I referenced in my opening statement of there's been this other change that's happened, this secularization of morality.  That is, you have to actually have good reasons for why you hold certain moral principles, and you should be able to articulate them.  And so that's been the changer.  So even if you and I both listen to the still small voice within to decide what's right or wrong, Dinesh, I'm claiming you're not getting it from the Bible and I'm not either, we're getting it from somewhere else.  I think we've evolved this propensity to have moral emotions, and then culture tweaks them, and we've been getting progressively more moral.\", 'Yeah, where do you get it? [laughter] I mean, does God -- does God speak to you and tell you?', 'Yeah.', \"Just to clarify the point just briefly.  So you just eloquently described the geography of religious beliefs of India.  When Lawrence goes to lecture in India, he doesn't discover that they do physics differently in India.  They do physics everywhere around the world the same.  There's just one physics.  There's not, you know, Indian physics and Australian physics and so forth.  There's just one physics.  That's the larger point.\", \"Well, we have an -- we have good answers to that. Female Speaker: Okay. Michael Shermer: I mean, the evolution of flowering plants is there in coevolution with insects.  There's a reason why orchids and other flowers look like insects, to mimic insects so that the real insects try to mate with them and move the pollen around.  And so what we perceive as aesthetically beautiful or so on, of course, looks very different to the eyeball of an insect.  It has a different worldview, in that sense, because evolution selected for it to do a certain thing.  Otherwise it wouldn't look that way. Male Speaker: But were you [inaudible] you actually create -- [talking simultaneously]\", 'Well, in a way we do measure beauty.  The marketplace of people that buy flowers, essentially, determine how the breeders create them, based on the ones that most people find really beautiful.  There actually is a measurable way for that.', \"Yeah.  So we get this a lot.  You know, how do you explain this or that?  I think people's experiences are real, absolutely.  I think most people don't just make up stories, although some do.  Most people when they experience what they describe some miraculous, fantastic spiritual experience that they've had, they really mean it. Now, so the question is, what does it represent?  Something out there in the world or something inside the brain?  Well, we now know enough about neuroscience to know that the brain does generate a lot of these kind of spiritual experiences, near death experiences, out of body experiences, sense presences, hallucinations, delusions. There's whole books about this.  And so the experiences are real.  What we want to know as scientists is what do they actually represent.  I mean, we know we can replicate these in the lab by doing certain things and causing people's brains to have these experiences.  So most likely, the what's more likely question, that it's out there or that it's in here.  The overwhelming evidence is that they're in here. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 -\", \"The quick answer is that there are Bills, and we've seen Bills.\", \"So the that's different than an invisible God that may or may not exist.\", 'When I was a Christian and I matriculated at Pepperdine University, I was in what I call the \"bubble.\"  I was in the bubble where everybody around you believes.  And in that bubble, the Christian worldview like any other worldview is internally consistent.  It\\'s inherently logical.  It\\'s reinforced by everybody around you until you step outside of the bubble. What happened with me is I went to graduate school and I started to study social psychology, anthropology, psychology, and beliefs, and so on.  And there I realized that none of those arguments actually make sense in and of themselves, the arguments for God\\'s existence.  What became clear to me is that what happens is, is you arrive at beliefs for non-rational, non-smart reasons, and then you back into it after the fact with rational reasons to justify it.  We call this the \"confirmation bias.\"  And so for me I think there\\'s overwhelming evidence that I\\'ve given you tonight that there\\'s good anthropological social science reasons why people believe in God that, that doesn\\'t prove there\\'s a god, that it proves that we create gods in our heads.  In addition to that, I don\\'t think there\\'s any evidence to support that there actually is a god out there separate from our beliefs. But finally my final point is this, is that I don\\'t even think it\\'s possible for there to be a God, at least not a supernatural God in this way, if God is supernatural, that is, outside of the space and time, there\\'s no way for us to know it.  Therefore, whatever God is, it would have to be a natural being or at least some kind of a being that reaches in to stir the particles, and if he does, then we should be able to measure it, because that\\'s what we do as scientists.  We measure the motions of particles.  And so far we have no Intelligence Squared U.S. - 58 - evidence of that.  So, therefore, I think that the most we could hope to find would be some kind of a natural being, in which case it would just become part of science, and that would be the end of the whole God concept.  So if you agree with me that the evidence points in that direction, that we constructed gods and not vice versa, I would urge you to vote on our side for the proposition that \"science refutes God.\"']\n",

      "['So somebody forgot to tell the police about all those credentials.  And I got arrested for a crime I didn\\'t commit.  It was when I had the most high profile case as a prosecutor, I was prosecuting a U.S. senator, and, again, I got locked up.  You can read all about it in the first chapter of my book, \"Let\\'s Get Free, a Hip-Hop Theory of Justice.\" [laughter]', 'My partner is Nick Gillespie.', 'Thank you.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  My name is Paul Butler, and I represent the people.  When I was a prosecutor, that\\'s how I would start my opening statements.  I put a lot of people in prison; I was a soldier in the war on drugs, and tonight I\\'m going to give you a soldier\\'s perspective on why that war is a colossal failure. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - Later, Nick will talk about how the war on drugs has compromised our democracy and made us all less free.  And he\\'ll also talk about what legal regulation of drugs would look like.  Will you be able to go into Whole Foods and buy cocaine?  Nick will tell you about the experiences of countries all over the world that have safely legalized drugs.  As a prosecutor, I learned that as many people as I locked up, we weren\\'t making a dent in the drug trade; we were actually making neighborhoods less safe.  I was prosecuting a lot of 19- and 20-year-olds for nonviolent drug offenses.  Locking up these young people with a bunch of hardcore rapists and murderers was like sending them to finishing school for criminals.  When these kids came home, they had learned how to be really good bad guys.  If we legalize drugs, we will stop the counter-productive practice of treating kids the same that we treat violent criminals, and we would all be safer. Maybe my work as a prosecutor would\\'ve been worth the enormous social cost if it was getting drugs off the street, but we all know the war on drugs doesn\\'t do that.  No country has ever found a way to prevent people from using drugs. The United States locks up more people than any country in the history of the world. We have 5 percent of the world\\'s population and 25 percent of the world\\'s prisoners.  It costs us billions of dollars that we just cannot afford, and it\\'s just as easy to get drugs now as it always has been. What about drug addicts?  It turns out that the small percentage of people who use drugs who become addicts, we know that treatment is a more effective solution than punishment for those people.  Most of us are lucky, we don\\'t have a crack head or a meth addict in our family, but everybody\\'s got an alcoholic in the family; tobacco might be a close second, but I think we all agree that alcohol is probably the worst drug, right? If you think of it in terms of dysfunctional families, laws, economic productivity, health problems, the people who commit crimes under the influence.  But is the answer to make using alcohol a crime?  Of course not.  We tried that during Prohibition and it just did not work.  All we did was create this illegal, violent market for liquor just like for other drugs now, and we didn\\'t stop anybody who wanted to, from drinking, just like we don\\'t stop anybody now from using drugs. So I\\'m speaking based on my research as a law professor, my work as a prosecutor, and also, my life experience.  Ladies and gentlemen, there\\'s a lot of hypocrisy in the war on drugs, but I want to respect you enough to keep it real.  Like most Americans, I have used illegal drugs.  I wasn\\'t introduced to them at my all-black public elementary school Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - in Chicago, and at my Catholic high school, a lot more kids drink than smoke weed.  The first time I was around a lot of people who used drugs was actually at Yale, where I went to college. [laughter] And then at Harvard, where I went to law school.  I\\'m glad I never got caught when I smoked pot, and I\\'m also glad that Barack Obama was not arrested and prosecuted for any of the times that he used cocaine and marijuana.  My opponents are honorable men, and it makes me wonder if they really practice what they preach.  As you listen to the good doctor Theodore, here\\'s one thing you should keep in mind.  He has actually prescribed heroin to addicts.  He did it because he knows that addicts need to be treated, not punished.  As a practicing physician, he understood that drug dependency is a medical issue, not a crime.  And I read a profile of Mr. Hutchinson and he\\'s a wonderful family man; I had the pleasure of meeting his wife, Susan.  And I wonder what a father, a great father like Mr. Hutchinson would say if one his children called and said she was using cocaine. Would he really say, \"Wait a minute, honey,\" and whisper to his wife, \"Quick, dial 911, tell the police they need to arrest out daughter; she needs to be prosecuted and locked up.\"  Of course not, none of us would do that to our family or friends. So my final point, ladies and gentlemen, is, respectfully, what is good enough for our children and our friends is good enough for African-Americans.  We call it a war on drugs but it\\'s mainly a war on black people; they\\'re the people who get stopped and frisked. Last year in New York City, 50,000 people got arrested for marijuana possession, 50,000, almost 90 percent were black or Latino.  That\\'s not who really uses drugs.  The National Institute of Health tells us that black people don\\'t use drugs more than any other group.  They\\'re about 12 percent of drug users. What about sellers?  Most drug buyers report buying from someone of their own race. White kids in Scarsdale, they dont have to go to the hood to buy.  They get their weed and Ecstasy and Adderall from other white skids in Scarsdale.  But who gets locked up for drug crimes?  Almost two-thirds are black, 12 percent of people who do the crime, 60 percent of people who do the time.  And that\\'s selective prosecution, and it\\'s devastated the African-American community.  We have one black president and one million black people in prison.  The book \"The New Jim Crow\" tells us that because of Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - the war on drugs there are more African-Americans under criminal justice supervision now than there were slaves in 1850.  Think about the catastrophic effect that has on families.  In the black community, we have a lot of women and children who are doing time on the outside. So, again, the most responsible way to deal with the problems of illegal drug use is to not punish people for using drugs.  The reality is, for my opponents, this will never -- this is just a nice rhetorical debate.  The odds are that their children will use drugs, and they will never be touched by the criminal justice system.  The odds for African-American children are very different.  And that just seems profoundly unfair.  My friends, as a civilized society, we shouldn\\'t punish people for being sick.  We shouldn\\'t put anybody in a cage based on what they put in their mouths.  There\\'s a better way.  It\\'s to legalize drugs.', \"Yeah.  It's just not true.  Asa makes it sound like blacks use drugs more than anybody else.  And as anyone who's been to college or high school knows, it's simply not true. We really shouldn't be talking about legalizing drugs.  We should be talking about re- legalizing them.  For most of our history, drugs have been perfectly legal.  You can go into a drugstore in the 1800s and buy opium.  Coca-Cola started out with a cocaine derivative in it.  So what made them become illegal?  Nothing to do with public safety. It was all about race.  First drug criminalized, opium.  San Francisco, 1890, the concern was that Chinamen were using it to seduce white women, can trace it right down the line.  Marijuana, Mexican field hands.  It was making them lazy.  With blacks, it was that Coke and ice.  Negroes were running rampant in the South.  So our war on drugs is about race through and through.  It always has been, and it is right now.\", \"I don't think that that's the only motive.  But I think that when we look historically at how the drug laws have been used -- what happens to white people who use drugs?\", \"But why don't prisons look like America then?\", 'But in -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 21 -', \"Well, I think addiction is a medical issue, and I think Nick and I agree that only a small percentage of people who use drugs become addicted to it.  So most people are able to use marijuana and other drugs recreationally and go to work the next day.  Most people are also able to do that with alcohol.  For the percentage of people who have substance abuse problems with it, we know, the good doctor knows, that's a health issue.  Police, prosecutors, they make lousy doctors.  Jailers make even worse doctors.  So the way to treat that problem, the way to heal those people is to use what we know about, and not what we know about locking people up, because what we know about locking people up is, it doesn't work.\", \"You think it's a moral problem?\", 'Wow.', \"So the reason that most people don't smoke isn't because smoking tobacco is a crime. It's because we know it's not good for us.  That's the same reason why even a regime of legalization, the vast majority of us are not going to use heroin or meth.  But it's public health that will be responsible -- the most responsible way for treating people who abuse those substances.\", \"I'm not, in part because we have to do our cost-benefit analysis.  We have to ask if that's true, is it worth it?  The costs have been 2.5 million people in prison, the costs have been one in three young black men with a criminal case, more African-American young men in prison than in college.  The cost has been billions of dollars that we can't afford, money away from our schools, away from our healthcare system, going straight to prison.  So especially if we understand that those are people who are locked up for using drugs.  I don't have a problem.  If you steal, if you rob, then yes, you should be punished. But when we're thinking about people who are locked up, 500,000 people, those are Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - nonviolent drug offenders.  And again, entirely selective.  They're African-American and Latino two-thirds of them.  There're some states where 80 to 90 percent of the people in prison for drug crimes are black.  And we know that's not the reality of who's using drugs.  That's selective law enforcement.\", 'How can you separate those?', \"-- it's not an issue then -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 -\", 'So --', \"-- I am concerned about this nanny state that the government is creating where we can't have -- it started with certain drugs, and it seems to be going down the road to trans fats, right, to smoking in parks, smoking tobacco in parks, and even big gulp cans of soda. So if we buy this idea that people aren't responsible enough to make intelligent decisions for themselves, which my opponents don't seem to think people are, we ought to be concerned about these draconian laws, and we ought to especially be concerned about who they're going to be applied against.  I guarantee you that white people -- very few white people in New York are going to be arrested for smoking in parks.  It's going to be African-Americans and Latinos.  That's the reality.  We can't divorce the reality from this rhetoric.\", \"In your world, for somebody to get help, they have to admit that they're a criminal.\", \"And admit that you've broken the law? Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -\", \"Nobody thinks that about tobacco.  Nobody thinks tobacco is okay because it's legal.\", \"True.  And if we listen to the leaders of the Latin American countries, they're calling for more responsible drug policies, including for us to consider legalization, because they know that the violence is sparked by the illegal market which is sparked by the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 - enormous demand for drugs from the United States.  So if we get rid of that illegal market, including by having drugs regulated like we regulate tobacco and alcohol now, we'll get rid of the violence.  Again, that's exactly what happened during prohibition.  Al Capone wasn't nothing but a drive-by shooter.  And again, when we got rid of that illegal market, we got rid of the violence.\", \"And so there are fewer coffeehouses because there's less of a demand.  It turned out in Amsterdam, when they made smoking pot legal, fewer kids wanted to do it.  It wasn't as cool.  So, respectfully, Dr. Theodore and Asa, if you really want kids to stop smoking pot, you should go on TV yourselves and fire up a big juicy blunt. [laughter]\", 'I had a --', \"-- a member of my family go through the same experience.  He was dying of lung cancer, and his doctor told him that marijuana would be the best thing.  He didn't live in a state where medical marijuana was available, and so our family faced the difficult choice of becoming lawbreakers, risking arrest and prosecution, or watching my relative live and die in pain.\", 'Thanks first to my great partner and my very worthy opponents.  It sounds, though, like I was wrong about how Asa would respond to someone who he cares about who has a drug problem, because it does sound like he thinks the best thing to do is to call the police, because he said that\\'s the only way that they\\'ll get help.  I just fundamentally disagree with that.  I don\\'t think that in order to get treated for a drug problem you should have to admit that you\\'re a criminal.  I agree with President Obama when he said, during the first campaign, that it\\'s blind and counterproductive to lock up nonviolent drug offenders.  If it worked, if it got drugs off the street, then maybe I\\'d support it.  But we know that it just doesn\\'t work.  Clarence Thomas, before he became the first African-American on the Supreme Court, was a judge in D.C.  And he said, when he would look out of the window of his chambers and see all these young black men filing into the criminal court in chains, he would think, \"There but for the grace of God go I.\"  My friends, the determination of who goes to criminal court in chains should not be so fortuitous.  It should not depend so much on the color of your skin or how much money your parents make.  As long as it does, we need to legalize drugs.']\n",
      "[\"I'm guilty.\", \"I'd say the only danger is that oftentimes you run out. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - [laughter]\", \"Well, I'm going to try and channel the methamphetamine that Asa was talking about, so hopefully I'll need only about three minutes.\", 'You know --', 'Thank you. [applause] I do want to point out in all fairness that being among the foremost libertarians in America means that myself and my coauthor, you know, that\\'s basically it. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - [laughter] So, you know, you\\'ve heard from a self described soldier in the drug war.  You\\'ve heard from a general, a commander, former Drug Enforcement Administration personnel in the drug war.  You\\'ll hear from a medic in the drug war.  I present myself simply as a conscientious objector in the war on drugs. [laughter] Let me explain a bit of why I think we should legalize drugs.  And the first -- I want to make two large points.  First is, let\\'s look at this war on drugs which is supposedly -- you know, the light is at the end of the tunnel, we\\'re going to bring the troops home by Christmas.  This is what Asa Hutchinson was saying, essentially, when he\\'s saying, \"Look, you know, it\\'s been working pretty well these past 30 years.  Drug use is down.  If we get rid of the war on drugs, drug use will go up.\"  So I want to talk about that.  And then I want to address some of the things that Paul previewed for you.  And, first and foremost, I want to make this statement.  And half of you in this audience, if you are representative, are with me in your action in what economists call revealed preference. You know, using drugs is not immoral.  It is not addictive for 99 percent of people.  And there\\'s nothing wrong with it or to be ashamed about with it.  Look, any program -- it\\'s not a war on drugs, it is a war on racial, ethnic, and age-based minorities, because it\\'s kids who get wrapped up in the war on drugs; it\\'s not old people.  Any program that has such disparate impacts as the ones that Paul was talking about should come under scrutiny regardless of its intentions and its champions.  As a 2005 cost benefit analysis of the war on drugs, by the super conservative American Enterpriser Institute, which looked at the effectiveness, the conclusion by David Boyum and Peter Reuter was American drug policy has little to show by way of success for that $2.5 trillion that John mentioned at the beginning of the program. And they claim it is surely reasonable to ask those who would maintain the status quo for some basis for believing the additional expense and suffering of putting hundreds of thousands of people a year in jail are justified.  Another AEI scholar -- and AEI, you\\'ll remember it from the Iraq and Afghanistan war, this is a think tank that has never met a war it doesn\\'t like -- Mark Perry, an economist at AEI, has pointed out that between 1970 and 2010 annual spending on drug control has gone up 10 times, adjusted for inflation, while the addiction rate has remained flat.  In other words, we have become the world\\'s largest jailer nation without seriously getting better outcomes.  The only Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - other place where we stand for that kind of massive increase in spending with flat or declining results is public education, which is no model for any kind of program going forward. [applause] Across every conceivable front, the war on drugs is losing the battle for hearts and minds.  A recent Rasmussen  poll just -- you know, which is a right leaning pollster, 8 percent of people think we\\'re winning the war on drugs. A century of failure, because it starts with the 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act or Controlled Substances Act, has finally woken Americans up to the simple fact that prohibition exacerbates all of the social problems it is supposed to ameliorate.  It doesn\\'t make things better, it makes everything worse.  Despite attempts to control -- to stem the supply of drugs, the amount and quality of drugs continues to go up while the inflation adjusted price goes down.  As Washington State and Colorado were voting to legalize marijuana, Californians voted to change its mandatory sentencing laws that grew out of concern about drug crime because its prisons are choked by non-violent drug offenders while they have to let rapists and murderers out.  The Rand Corporation and other think tanks have found no consistent correlation between a nation\\'s legal regime towards drugs and use rate. So in some countries you have lax drug laws and high use rates or low use rates.  In places like America we have stern drug laws and high use rates.  It\\'s not clear what\\'s going on; we do know in Portugal, which decriminalized all drugs, that use rates and addiction rates went down, because people got better information and they were more willing to come forward before they developed problems. So, if you\\'re concerned on the effects of drug use on a society, you should reject the failed policies pursued by often well-meaning, but seriously misinformed drug warriors, also known as the loyal opposition here. [laughter] Well, such basic empirical scrutiny alone should convince all observers to consider an unconditional surrender in what is rightly called America\\'s longest war.  I want to make a brief case for what I call pharmacological freedom, or granting adult Americans the broadest possible rights to choose what substances we put into our bodies.  And here is where I go into the meth round, because I\\'m running out of time. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - [laughter] This should be recognized.  Pharmacological freedom should be recognized as a basic right.  Over the past several decades, we have become a drug-taking culture, and we all believe in what DuPont used to advertise as \"better living through chemistry.\"  We take drugs to change our cholesterol levels, to change our work habits, to change our moods. None of this is going away, nor should it.  We do all sorts of things to make ourselves look and feel better.  To the extent that we might be able to use drugs that are currently arbitrarily deemed illicit, not just illegal, but illicit, by the government, the better.  Ladies and gentlemen, if we don\\'t have the right, literally, to change our mind through our personal choices, what rights do we have that are worth a damn?  Now, drug legalization is not a scary prospect.  It\\'s not the radical change that its champions claim not its opponents fear.  And let me -- as I\\'m winding down, how many of you have tried an illegal drug?  Raise your hand. [applause] Anybody carrying? [laughter] And if so -- okay.  I\\'ll talk to you later. Male Speaker: Nick, for our radio audience, how many hands did you see up? Nick Gillespie: I think it was about 100 percent. [laughter] For use, not carrying, okay.  Because otherwise I think I see Asa hitting \"911\" under the table. [laughter] Look, according to government statistics, fully 47 percent of Americans over the age of 12 have done so.  A population that includes, at least, the last three presidents of the United States, which, granted, may constitute the strongest argument against using Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - drugs -- [laughter] -- but drug use is a normal phenomenon, very few people become addicts.  So when we are talking about what drug legalization would look like, first off, it\\'s all marijuana use. Vanishingly small people -- percentage of people use drugs other than marijuana.  But let me just say, I\\'ll close with -- there\\'s not a single dimension across which pot is more dangerous than alcohol, which is pretty much all you need to know about a post- prohibition American society. It would be a lot like today, except that you would have one or two more choices in your medicine cabinet, and about 400,000 fewer people a year would go to jail; police would be able to focus on actual criminals and Monday mornings would be a lot easier to face. [laughter] So, please, think about legalizing drugs.  Thank you.', 'Well, let me --', \"You know, I side with Paul in a sense that the origins of drug prohibition, and many of the continuum policies are inextricably and I think incontrovertibly linked to race or other out group stigma.  LSD became associated with young people in the '60s.  It was bad.  There was legal effectivelyuntil 1967 --\", \"Not by old people, you know? [laughter] And the same thing happened with ecstasy.  How many of you -- I mean, if you're over 50, you had the opportunity to use ecstasy legally until 1986.  It was then demonized as a youth drug, first, one that made you antisocial, then one that made you prosocial and you'd go out to a rave and have sex all night or dehydrate.  But more importantly -- [laughter] -- you know, well, hydration is very important, you know.  It's the skin. [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - More importantly, we need to dial back the hysteria.  So, for instance, I just want to focus on one point that was being --\", '-- wait, just --', '-- methamphetamine, one-tenth of 1 percent of people in America report having used it in the past 30 days.

[laughter] [applause] But in Colorado, you know, the initiative that was passed for marijuana legalization was basically, I mean, it was out there, and it's a similar thing in Washington State, to treat marijuana like wine, beer, and alcohol.  So it's not a question -- and, Theodore, I think your opposition is --\", \"-- is a false -- yeah, well, it could be.  That remains to be seen actually because each -- Washington State has about a year to figure out the technical implementation and Colorado has about six months, but it's not a choice between anarchy and, I'll ratchet it down, regulatory system, but there will be laws.  There will be customs.  There will be traditions.  There will be advertising.  There will be information available.  And I -- the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - real question is about legalizing drugs.  Do you consider alcohol to be legal?  Let's have a regime that is very similar to that for currently illegal substances.\", \"I think there's a major, kind of, conceptual error when we're talking about crime here. When -- we know that Mexican drug cartels are killing people on both sides of the border.  When's the last time you heard about a Dos Equis shoot out? [laughter] Where a beer distributor crossing the border --\", \"The last time you heard about that sort of thing was during alcohol prohibition.  And so, it's not that --\", \"Sure.  You know what?  We already do.  What would happen is, if we had a legal one, the other social harms would be reduced.  I'm not a utopian, what I do believe is that not only would responsible individuals have a broader palate of things to make their life better, but also, many bad things would diminish.  When we're talking addiction or substance abuse -- you know, I don't drink anymore, because I was a bad drinker; I tried my hardest to drink and drink and drink, I gave it up.  If I had to admit that I was a criminal as well as having a substance abuse problem, I doubt that I would've gotten there quite as fast as I did, which was long enough. [applause]\", 'Can I ask --', \"I mean, I'd like too defer to the experience and the expertise of the opposition to legalization.  But I'm left wondering what world we're talking about here.  So they're talking about how bad Oxycontin is.  Oxycontin is a prescription drug that is already legal and regulated.  I don't see how that really has a lot to do with talking about a legalization debate.  It's already legal.  And here are the stats that are important.  The government runs something called the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.  And basically, 30 -- in the past month use, they ask people, have you used this drug in the past 30 days, which is kind of a proxy for, you know, a regular user or a casual user. About 7 percent of people over the ages of 12 -- 12-year-olds by the way, you know almost a hundred percent, they say yes to everything. [laughter] But about 7 percent of Americans say that they've used pot in the past month.  That by far -- by a factor of three or more, that's the most widely used illegal drug, or legal drug that's used illegally. The next one is opioids, the prescription drugs that Theodore was talking about, which comes in at 2.7 percent.  When you're talking about things like meth and heroin, one- tenth of one percent.  Hallucinogens covering a wide range of things, five-tenths of one percent.  Crack or cocaine, including crack, six-tenths of one percent.  These are nonfactors.  And as Paul was suggesting, if they're made legal, who out here is going to be like, finally, heroin is legal, you know?  You know, let's go.  Let's try it.  No.  Okay, that's not going to happen.  It's about pot.  And we all know that pot is not a dangerous drug, that pot is not a gateway anymore than mother's milk, you know, is the ultimate gateway drug because everybody who uses heroin started out with mother's milk.  But it's about pot, and we need to focus on that.\", \"-- the incarceration of 500,000 people, you know, that's about how --\", \"That's a good question.  Why do we now?  Because most people who get drug tested, you get drug tested when you're applying for a job and that's it.  It's a joke.  It's a hurdle to weed out people who -- you know, on other grounds.  The people --\", 'Of course.  And what airline, what airline or trucking company, or whatever, is not going to regularly test people, because it puts them at enormous insurance risk?  These things are handled and -- to talk about another market mechanism, we don\\'t need -- and this is the libertarian in me speaking, we don\\'t need the government to test and testify to the purity of methamphetamine, we will have fair trade methamphetamine -- [laughter] -- you know, private certification agencies, just like with coffee or biodynamic wine or organic foods -- [laughter] -- will spontaneously spring into being.   And, just to follow up on one point, the reason why I\\'m stressing marijuana, it goes back to some things that Paul is saying, and I don\\'t think that the other side is fully acknowledging, which is that we live in a world where school kids tell everybody who asks them, \"You know, you can get drugs easier than you can get beer, any kind of drug you want.\"  The use ratios are pot, very much--much less, prescription drugs, and these tiny vanishing statistical errors of things like heroin.  Even if you double or triple the heroin use, it goes from -- one-tenth of 1 percent to three- tenths of 1 percent.  I don\\'t think that\\'s a reason to hold everyone else hostage who can act responsibly.

      "[\"Well, I am always succinct.  To the partisan, I guess I'm old enough to remember when Bill Bradley and I collaborated on an idea that's not too far dissimilar to tonight.  And President Obama's housing plans follow work by me and by a colleague at Columbia.\", 'My partner is Art Laffer.', 'Thank you.  Thank -- [applause] I\\'d certainly like to thank Intelligence Squared and the Richmond Center for an event on topic this important.  My partner, Art Laffer, the eponymous economist, will follow with some great thoughts on why raising tax rates is the wrong place to start.  But I just want to make two points this evening. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - First, raising tax rates on the rich is both counterproductive and unnecessary to fund the government that Americans have traditionally had.  I\\'ll come back to that point.  Second, if we do want a larger government, and that\\'s a political choice, the extra taxes to pay for that government will largely come from the non-rich.  Now, let\\'s start with how high tax rates are.  If you look at survey data and ask Americans what they think is fair that about a quarter or a bit more would be fair in taxes paid.  If that\\'s true, the current and projected marginal tax rates -- that is the tax rate on the next dollar that you earn -- are very high for upper income folks, 35 percent for ordinary income.  And, if you\\'re New Yorkers in this audience, you know that by omitting state and local taxes, I\\'m leaving a lot on the table here.  And 15 percent for dividends and capital gains, but of course corporate taxes were already paid there.  And, on top of that, there\\'s an estate tax that taxes money that had already been taxed once or twice in someone\\'s lifetime. All of these taxes are set to rise substantially next year, 40 percent for earned income, 44 percent for dividends, 24 percent for capital gains, and beyond.  Now, the calls for higher tax rates really raise two concerns.  First, if you step back, they treat the nation\\'s income as an already big pie, and it doesn\\'t really matter for the size of that pie how it\\'s sliced.  An economic observation of that is that ignores a lot of incentives that taxes have on the decisions we all make.  Those sorts of incentives would lead to lower activity, lower jobs, and lower incomes.  The second choice here is that the real fiscal policy choice facing the nation is really about the size of government.  And here my observation isn\\'t economics, it\\'s just arithmetic: if we want the larger government, we all will have to pay for it. The bulk of the taxes will come from the non-rich.  Now, let\\'s start, first, on the cost of raising tax rates.  Now, I can look out and tell that your favorite course in college was, of course, economics, and you remember, from the public finance lecture in that class, you can boil it down to a simple sentence: if you tax something you get less of it.  And economists worry, particularly, about tax rates that are already high.  Now, some of the somethings we get less of are work and saving.  And, here, I just want to offer you a forecast, and I should be honest with you that President Bush once said about me that \"Glenn can\\'t even forecast the past.\" [laughter] And I think what the president meant was data get revised, but you take that for what it\\'s worth.  But economists, like me, and my own academic research, have forecast changes in taxable income from changes in tax rates.  The responses of high income tax Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - payers are not only absolutely high, they are much higher than the responses of other tax payers. Of particular concern in this regard is the taxation of business income.  High business taxes discourage investments in machines and ideas and jobs.  More than half of Americans who work in the private sector work for businesses whose owner pay taxes at individual rates.  Raising taxes on those business owners discourages hiring, discourages investment.  If you make a comparison of next year\\'s tax law, with higher rates, to the much bally-hooed Bowles-Simpson plan, you\\'d find that the lower tax rates in Bowles-Simpson that are financed by broadening the tax base, would raise investment in businesses by 54 percent, and raise hiring by 14 percent.  And high tax rates don\\'t necessarily produce revenue.  The fact that revenue shares and GDP haven\\'t varied substantially across periods when the top marginal rate was more than 70 percent, from when it was less than, or about, 28 percent, suggests that we have a lot of lost taxable income and a lot of wasteful tax planning when we have high tax times. The right answer is tax reform to raise money from upper income households by broadening the tax base, and to seek expenditure reform that also reduces benefits for those tax payers.  Now, what about the larger government?  Before the financial crisis, federal spending in the U.S. averaged about 20 percent of GDP for many decades.  What if we decide we\\'d like a bigger government?  Let\\'s say 25 percent, or maybe a larger number, like many European countries.  Shouldn\\'t raising tax rates on the rich pay for that government?  Well, the simple answer is no.  Or, more accurately, it can\\'t.  If you look across the OECD, the club of rich industrial nations, you\\'ll find something that may surprise some of you.  The U.S. has the most progressive tax system. And, in fact, the U.S. tax system actually decreased inequality more than any other country\\'s tax system.  So you think to yourself, \"Well, how can this be? We\\'re thinking of European nations with large government and social welfare programs.\"  But the answer is simple, for reasons of arithmetic, that is, there\\'s just not that much income at the top, and economics, consequences for investment and for jobs would be too grim, those nations actually use broad based consumption taxes, like a VAT that are borne by all citizens to fund their spending.  So the real choice is the size of government.  That\\'s the debate we need to have first.  Taxation should be fair, but it should also seek to advance growth and living standards.  The right tax system for this country can accomplish both. And so, for the government of the size that we all have been used to before the past few years, we can, we should, accomplish both fairness and growth without raising tax rates on high income individuals. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - If we, the body politic, want a larger government, we all must pay.  The rich are not a plug number in a budget gambit for a free lunch.  For the proposition, The Rich Are Taxed Enough, the answer is clear, and it\\'s yes. [applause]', \"Three quick points here.  First of all, there's been some discussion of Bowles-Simpson, but I think it's important for everyone to understand the marginal tax -- the top marginal rate in the Bowles-Simpson compromise plan is 28 percent.  And that's financed by broadening the tax base.  If we have a healthy tax system, the growth that that engenders will, in fact, raise revenue, yes, but it's not by raising tax rates. Second point, in fairness, is the OECD point that I made.  If you look across industrial countries, the U.S. actually has, by far, the most progressive tax system.  We rely much more on taxes that affect high income individuals that peer countries, and we do so for the reason I suggested.  The third point I want to mention, if you add up all the tax increases on the rich that are currently being discussed in Washington, it's about 1 percent of GDP.  The Congressional Budget Office has come up tonight.  They would tell you that the long-term problem in Social Security and Medicare alone is on the order of 10 percentage points of GDP.  Anybody who's selling you that taxes on the rich are going to get us out of the fiscal hole doesn't know the math.\", \"I'm saying it's more progressive, I think it's -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 -\", 'We need a progressive tax system.  The question is, can we balance progressivity and growth?  We definitely can.', \"No, well, that's just not true unless it's a parallel arithmetic because the marginal tax rates are coming down at the same time.  So, what you're doing is raising revenue in a more efficient way.  Some individuals may pay more.  And, if the economy grows, virtually everyone will pay more, and that's just fine.  But, raising marginal tax rates, which has been the siren song of the tax debate, is just wrong. Male Speaker: No, can I -- Art Laffer: Do you agree that we should lower tax rates on the rich?\", \"You can't do that either in the short-term or the long-term.  So, let's be clear.  The current budget has spending full three percentage points higher than traditional levels in the country.  It is proposing to raise taxes on high-income people by 1 percent of GDP, and we just don't know what happens to the other two.  In the long term, as I've said, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 - just Social Security and Medicare alone are 10 times the cost, even of the most optimistic tax increases.  So, taxes aren't even an important part of this conversation. And, to the extent that they are, they would have to follow the European model, which is to raise them on everyone, a consumption tax.\", \"Yeah, again, if you look both at shares of income and shares of taxes paid, the U.S. is the most progressive, the CBO, not to get too much into the weeds here, really is not attributing the corporation income tax in any way that's really going to change those numbers, and on tax reform and growth it is certainly the case that if we broadened the base and lowered the rates we would get growth.  Otherwise, why are we going to do tax reform?  And that's fine, but that will raise revenue.  But we are not arguing for non- revenue neutral tax changes. It's up to you to argue that raising marginal rates, which you've referred to a few times this evening, actually is the way to go. Male Speaker: Yes. [talking simultaneously]\", \"Mark very helpfully, earlier, referred to a lot of structural problems facing the country. Those are problems that are subjects of another debate, but it is very important to ask the question to you, Mark, or to you, Bob, how is it that raising marginal tax rates on high income people gets at any of those structural problems?  You referred to globalization, there are skill gaps among low income people, I'm not connecting the dots, from your tax policy to dealing with the problem that actually should concern America.\", \"I think it's important to know that there is actually a lot of work in economics, and pretty conclusive about the positive effects of tax reform.  It's one of the few not --\", \"Lowering rates, broadening the base, that's one of the most fundamental results in economics.  And I think the beauty has been -- or the difficultly, the politicians are normally scared.  But, frankly, as an economic matter, I don't think it's controversial.  If you had the size of government that we had before the financial crisis, the normally functioning tax system would, roughly, fund that size of government. If you'd like, in your description of more for education and more for infrastructure, if what you mean is, you'd like a bigger government --\", \"I'll come back to the point I made before, you can't fund that on taxing the rich.  That's just math.\", \"Because the -- if you look at all of the tax increases that are currently being proposed, and I havent heard any politician on the left say they'd like even more, that's about 1 percent of GDP.  The present budget has an elevated spending level of more than 3 percent of GDP, and that's before the entitlement programs --\", \"I think there's a lot of pushback, both from economists, and probably more important, from politicians, on the tax increases that are being proposed now. [talking simultaneously]\", \"That's actually -- let me just correct the numbers.  Bowles-Simpson actually would raise - -\", 'This is when economists really get down and dirty.', 'Three quick points, first of all, again --', \"Yeah, well, what Art and I are arguing is to the extent that revenues come from faster growth from a reform system, we're fine for that.  You keep moving the goalposts, but you're talking about marginal rates and not that.  Second, there are significant real effects of raising taxes on business owners.  There's a huge body of research out there. You might not like it, but it is there.  And the third -- the question to you about your aspirations, again, Social Security and Medicare, these two programs are on track to rise 10 percentage points of GDP. Now, if you want to tax, finance that, you mentioned that a healthy --\", \"-- healthy revenue share in GDP is 19 percent, you'd have to raise every tax -- [talking simultaneously]\", \"You can't get there from here.\", \"We're everywhere. Male Speaker: Wait till you hear the question. [laughter] My question is to Mr. Laffer, he just took the example of Warren Buffett, who's on a stated income of 40 million paid 7 million in taxes, whereas you think his income was 12 billion. So if whichever way, the loopholes are closed or the rates increase, don't you think the rich man should be paying more and, therefore, don't you think this motion -- [talking simultaneously] Glenn Hubbard: Warren is a Columbia Business School graduate. Thats how you answer this question.\", \"The reference to small numbers, small businesses being at the top misses the fact that about half of the people in the top 1 percent are business owners.  And, if you look at the calculation that I made for you, if you compare what's going to happen to investment and hiring by those individuals as they're paying taxes at individual rates, you're looking at changes on the order of 50 percent in investment, 14 percent in hiring, in an era when the economy is struggling.  You know, there's a reason the president took a pass on raising marginal rates the last time.\", \"Actually, he gets dividends, but thats okay-- Female Speaker: Don't you think -- please let me finish.  Don't you think the capital gains tax should equal the marginal tax rate?  And doesn't Mitt Romney feel guilty that he pays the same --\", \"There's no question from a tax fairness or social justice point of view that we need a progressive tax system. The wealthy in our society should pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden, and I don't think any serious -- at least economist -- has suggested otherwise.  But, to me, there's a strong element of social justice that's forgotten in that conversation, and this goes back to the conversation Mark and I were having earlier.  We really need a society that helps put people back on the ladder, and that's not a discussion of whose marginal tax rate is X or Y, but a discussion of how as a country we're going to help those people succeed.  That's the social justice.\", \"First of all, it's useful to know that the tax system in the U.S. does actually lean against in a very powerful way some of the forces that Bob and Mark have mentioned. I've already mentioned that in the context of the OECD.  It's also the case, though, that there's a pretty poor link between changing marginal tax rates at the top and accomplishing much of any of this.  It's really a question of setting priorities in government.  Do we want to be a country that has a few entitlement programs that have all of our spending dollars, or do we want to invest in the future?  That's a very legitimate discussion, but it has nothing to do with taxing the rich.\", 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 - But put differently, the skewing is a pretax phenomenon.  It relates to real phenomena out there in the world, and we can address those phenomena ', \"Okay, that's not the view of the rest of the table, just so there's no misconception.\", \"The optimal tax on savings is zero. [applause] Carl Pope: Im Carl Pope and Dr. Hubbard I sense a deal, and I want to offer you the deal, but I think the other side would take, but I'm not certain you would.  The four of you together come up with $2 trillion in cuts, you each have $500 billion, but you come up with $2 trillion together, you and Dr. Laffer then have to come up with some package of your choosing, unhampered by politics, of a trillion dollars from cutting marginal rates, closing loopholes, whatever you like, with the sole condition being that the trillion dollars has to be paid by the upper 1 percent and then --\", \"Well, if I understand the question-- [talking simultaneously] Glenn Hubbard: --then I can give a pretty simple answer to it.  There's a recent study that Harvey Rosen, who's a professor at Princeton, has done, it is possible to lower marginal tax rates substantially, broaden the base, get down to a 28 percent rate, with the growth, still have the high income people pay exactly the same tax share, that is, the money is coming from them, if that was your question, that's the answer.\", \"You've moved the goalpost several times tonight, but it is the case that -- [talking simultaneously]\", \"I like your question a lot, because sometimes we slip into the use of a word like deficit, which is an accounting term, when what we really mean is taxes and spending. Now, your question gets to the core of why it's important to separate those two parts. There's a big difference between changing the path of fiscal policy by raising taxes and cutting spending.  And I think the bulk of the evidence would suggest, yes, that the tax increase way would be more costly on the multipliers.  I'll tout my intermediate macro textbook, you can turn to the table of multipliers and you'll see that point pretty much from the literature.\", 'Yeah, basically, just to try to really answer your question.  There are two things that are on the table being discussed, I think, by tax reformers.  One would be some sort of cap on deductions -- that could be a dollar, that could be a percentage of your income. Another would be an approach Bowles-Simpson took, which really cut back a lot on the deductions of affluent people, but left the more in place for moderate income people. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 57 - Either one of those would get you there.', \"Thank you.   You know, just as Oliver Wendell Holmes famously observed, that paying taxes is actually the price we pay for living in a civilized society.  And a civilized society defends itself, it educates its citizens, it cares for those in need, but it's also got to be a society of opportunity and growth, a society of entrepreneurs and businesses, of seeing the fruits of one's own investment in time and in talents, of encouraging investment for tomorrow and not just consumption for today. Tonight Art and I have argued that confiscatory success taxes are wrongheaded, but they're also wrong.  I'd ask two questions of our partners tonight.  First, what evidence suggests that the economic consequences of higher tax rates on the successful could improve the employment or the income prospects of the rest?  And, second, is the nation better off by raising tax rates on high income people or by balancing fairness and prosperity, asking sacrifice from the affluent through the growth consequences of tax reform, and reforming our spending programs to be a safety net?  The question at hand tonight is a broad one and an important one.  This country has long identified with equality of opportunity.  And I worry a lot right now in our country about economic opportunity. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 60 - I'm fond of an example that illustrates my worry with an image of the nation as a tall building with the bottom flooded out, the penthouse doing fine, and the elevator broken.  We could throw rocks at the top or we could fix the elevator.  I think most Americans make the latter choice viscerally.  And to the points Art and I have made tonight, throwing rocks doesn't fix the elevator, and to torture the analogy, can't pay for it.  We need to think about growth and fairness.  The case for the proposition tonight is very strong.  Tax rates should not rise.  The rich are taxed enough.\"]\n",

And you\\'re going to create prosperity.  Those are the other two.  And I\\'m going to land on the last two and look at the facts if I can.  I mean, in the 30 -- if you look at the growth rate there, we can go back in time, but, you know, if you look at the periods let\\'s say from the Roaring \\'20s, we cut tax rates back then from 73 percent to 25 percent in the Roaring \\'20s.  It was called the \"Roaring 20s\" for a reason.  We had enormous expansion of growth, output, and employment.  The top 1 percent of income earners, now, we have great data on the top 1 percent of income earners.  The IRS really likes to know how much you owe them. And we have great data.  The top 1 percent of income earners, their taxes as a share of GDP soared during the period of the Roaring \\'20s.  If you look at the 1930s, we raised the highest margin -- well, we first had [unintelligible] May of 1930 we had the Smoot- Hawley Tariff. Then Hoover raised the highest tax rate on the rich from 25 percent to 63 percent.  Then Roosevelt on January 1936 raised it from 63 to 79 percent and then up to 83 percent. There\\'s a reason why it was called the Great Depression.  The economy was in a shambles in large part because of the tax increases.  The revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners as a share of GDP went down during this period.  You look at the Kennedy period where we cut the highest tax rates from 91 percent to 70 percent. We also put in the investment tax credit, accelerated depreciation, cut the corporate rates, did tariff reform as well -- the Kennedy-run tariff negotiation, tax rate -- it was called the -- it was called the \"Go-Go \\'60s,\" if you remember, a boom in the economy, and tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners went up during that period as a share of GDP.  We then had the four stooges, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter. [laughter] Which I consider to be the largest assemblage of bipartisan ignorance probably ever put on planet Earth. If you look at that period, we had stagnation for 16 straight years.  The stock market collapsed during that period.  Tax revenues for the top 1 percent of income earners went down as a share of GDP.  Then we had -- then we had Ronny -- oh, excuse me, the sky is opened, the sun shone forth on the planet, the grass turned green, the animals, they multiplied, the children danced in the street, but we cut the highest tax rates of everything we could find.  We had Steiger-Hansen in \\'78, then we cut the -- I mean, under Reagan, cut it from 70 percent to 28 percent.  If you look at the whole period Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - from 1978 all the way to 2007, we cut the highest tax rate on earned income from 50 percent to 35 percent.  We cut the highest tax rates on unearned income from 70 percent to 15 percent. We cut the capital gains tax rate, we cut all of these tax rates across the board.  We had a boom, and it wasn\\'t just Ronald Reagan.  Robert, your president, by the way, cut the capital gains tax rate dramatically; he got rid of capital gains taxes on owner occupied homes for everyone, he also got rid of the tax on retirees working, which was the group between 65 and 72.  He also put in welfare reform, he also cut gtovernment spending as a share of GDP by more than the next four best presidents combined, and he had the greatest secretary of labor of all time -- [laughter] But he was a big taxer.  We had huge growth during that period.  If you look at what happened to the tax revenues from the top income earners -- you know, in 1980 tax revenues as share of GDP from the top 1 percent was 1.5 percent of GDP.  By 2007, tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners was 3.2 percent of GDP, it more than doubled. Let me tell you really honestly, you\\'re not going to get the money from these guys. You\\'re not.  They can hire lawyers, they can hire accountants, they can hire deferred income specialists, they can hire congressmen, they can hire senators -- [laughter] They can hire -- when you see a group of people hanging with the president, don\\'t for a moment think it\\'s a group of street people trying to explain to the president what it\\'s like being poor.  They\\'re in there for some reason and they find it.  You know, what you really want to do is get a low rate, flat tax, where you have no exceptions, no exemptions, no deductions, none of that stuff.  And get them out of the business of trying to finagle their tax codes, get them out of the business of trying to influence government, get them into a position where they create prosperity and economic growth.  And that is the way you got to go.  We all want increased tax rates on the rich, but we want to do it not by raising rates, which won\\'t work, we want to do it by lowering rates and broadening the base.  And if I can correct one other little mistake, Robert, just a little one. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 17 - Simpson-Bowles lowers the highest tax rates on the rich, and so does Rivlin-Domenici. They lower rates, they broaden the base.  In \\'86, we cut tax rates on the rich dramatically, from 50 percent to 28 percent.  In the Senate, 97 votes for that, three against it, including Joe Biden.  What was his malarkey comment?  Excuse me, maybe he was looking in the mirror.  But you also had Bill Bradley, you also had Howard Metzenbaum, you had all of these -- and you had Chris Dodd and you had Teddy Kennedy.  Everyone knows that you don\\'t create growth by raising tax rates on the rich. You can\\'t love jobs and hate job creators. [laughter] And you can\\'t tax an economy into prosperity, it ain\\'t going to happen.  Thank you very much. [applause]', 'Yeah.  No, it\\'s not.  It\\'s totally not.  And let me use an example if I may, Warren Buffett. He was sitting there asking my friends and I need to have higher tax rates, and I looked at his letter to the New York Times, and he said he paid a little less than 7 million in taxes, and he said his tax rate was 17.4 percent, which I did the math, hold back, I\\'m a wiz, but I divided it.  He had adjusted gross income of $40 million in that year. I then went to Forbes.  His wealth increased from 40 billion to 50 billion.  I went to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and what you found there is he gave 1.75 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, not counting his sons foundations or his daughter\\'s foundation.  Now, as a definition of \"income,\" to me income is what you spend, what you give away, and your increase in your wealth.  It s called the Simon definition of income.  If you look at Bill Gates -- I mean -- if you look at Warren Buffett, his income that year was $12 billion, and he paid 7 million in taxes.  That is a tax rate of six 1/100th of 1 percent on his true income.  That is obnoxious.  But it\\'s not because of any rates raising would change that tax.  You\\'ve got to broaden the tax base by getting rid of all these exclusions, deductions, eliminations, and tax true income at low rates. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - And that is what\\'s fair.  The guys who play the game, and you look at the Forbes 500 and you see all of them with their tax exemptions, look at all the 501c3s, all the loopholes. That\\'s what we\\'ve got to go after, not raising tax rates on the last three people who actually pay it.', 'Yes.', \"No.  I'm not -- I thought we're talking about tax rate increases here.  We've all gone to that it's tax rates we're talking about.  Everyone wants to raise taxes by creating prosperity, it would be stupid not to.\", 'We are talking about tax rates here.  At least me. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 -', \"Come on.  You got tax rate reduction.  If you did tax rate reduction, broaden the base, and you created prosperity, of course we all want more revenues, we don't want deficits.  I mean, no one wants it.  How do you get it?  The way you get it, by the way, is the Reagan, Kennedy, Clinton, and also Harding and Coolidge did in the U.S., lowering tax rates and creating prosperity with a broad base.  That's what this proposition is.  The tax rates -- [talking simultaneously]\", \"Let's just talk about it.  Of course you do.  I mean -- and there's nothing wrong with the rich paying more in taxes if -- with the prosperity, which is exactly what happened, what I showed in the numbers there.  During the Roaring '20s, the rich paid more as a share of GDP by lowering rates dramatically.  If you look at the Kennedy period, the rich paid a lot more as a share of GDP by lowering rates dramatically.  Under the Reagan/Clinton period, the rich paid a lot more by lowering rates dramatically and creating prosperity. That is the dream, and that's where we go.  You cannot balance the budget on the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - backs of the unemployed.  You just plain can't.  And that's what you have to do.\", 'There he was almost nice, but seriously, I mean, the point of it here is \"Let\\'s take the \\'20s that you\\'re talking about.\"  We had those tax cuts.  We had that growth.  We have the rich becoming very prosperous.  There\\'s nothing wrong with the rich being rich.  The problem is when the poor are poorer.  The dream has always been to make the poor rich, and during the \\'20s, when we had the Roaring \\'20s, no other country did the tax codes we did.  After World War I they all stayed in depression the whole time.  That is the key here.  There\\'s nothing wrong with the prosperity we had from the \\'80s on.  But I\\'ll tell you what happened in the 1920s -- and they paid a lot more in taxes.', 'Yeah.', 'And it will and I am. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 -', \"These are exactly the problems we had in '86, and that's exactly what we did.  We took all of these loopholes and dumped them all, and we got a broader base.  Reagan said he would not -- he would veto the bill if it were either tax-raising or tax-lowering.  It was a tax reform bill that went across.  We lowered the highest rate from 50 percent to 28 percent.  And, in the Senate, we got 97 votes, three against us, and all these others voted with us.  It was obvious for all those politicians.  And they did it.  It's quite obvious right now as well.\", \"But let me answer two things, there are two ways of raising revenues.  One is to broaden the base and one is to lower rates, not raise them.  And that is the way to get your prosperity.  As you looked at every time, you go back to the Kennedy period where rates were much higher and all that, when Kennedy lowered those rates, guess what happened to revenues?  They went up as a share of GDP, not down from the top 1 Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - percent of income earners.  Not only did those revenues go up, but there were secondary and tertiary rate -- revenues going in, for the jobs that they created the output, the employment, the production, all of that.  They're huge revenue raisers. That is not true of any other income group.  It's not.  You raise tax rates on the poor or the middle income and you collect more revenues, but not on the rich.  You want more revenues from the rich, which I do, what you do is you broaden the base and you lower the rates, and both of those will bring you more revenue, period.\", \"Well, it doesn't go to zero, let's put it there.\", 'I will stipulate today --', 'Yeah.', \"And, you know, we did an '86 down to 28 percent.  That's a good number, or leave it where it is.\", 'How about --', 'You could maybe go lower.', 'If you broaden the base enough --', \"-- if you were -- I mean, I will -- none of you guys will agree with me here, but if you taxes unrealized capital gains and raise the bases, you could get it really low.  If you wouldn't allow all the 501c3s and have football tickets at Oklahoma, be tax exempt, I think you'd get it really low.  There's a huge amount of income out there that is not taxed at all, that. And then you lower the rate like I did with Gerry Brown -- [talking simultaneously]\", \"Well, my view is it should be flat rate across the board, just the way it was -- we raised capital gains tax rate in 1986 from 20 to 28 percent. We made it the same as every other.  I think that's the way you should go.  I think you should get it so that all forms of income are the same. [applause] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 -\", \"But that's true.  I am truly for a flat tax across the board, and get the hell out of the way, and let people produce --\", 'Let me just say --', 'My turn? [laughter]', \"I did Jerry Brown's flat tax when he ran for president in 1992, we got rid of all federal taxes.  You should look at every tax, not just income taxes.  We got rid of the income taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, employer and employee; we got rid of excise taxes, capital gains, estate taxes, tariffs.  And the only ones we left were sin taxes, which are really small.  And, in there, said we had two flat rates, one of business net sales, value added, and one on personal unadjusted gross income.  If you did that at full employment, you could have a flat tax rate of 11.8 percent and have it statically revenue-neutral, that's it.  You end up --\", '-- [unintelligible] --', \"Everyone's in the base.  They're all forms, where you tax Warren Buffett on his $12 billion income that year, not on $40 million, which is what he had in his AGI after all the legal tax deductions.\", 'What? Intelligence Squared U.S. - 56 -', \"Yeah, but she'd have a job.  That's the whole point.  Come on.\", \"I don't mind her paying for her cigarettes.\", \"Thank you.  First of all, I'd like to congratulate Bob and Mark for trying to change the proposition to get a different one.  The question is tax rates and, frankly, what Glenn have been arguing are, why would you ever want to raise tax rates on the rich if you know it's going to give you less revenue and a less prosperous economy?  It's as simple as that and the evidence out there documents that time and time again.  One of the ways I would do is lowering tax rates, but doing it by broadening the tax base to keep revenue neutral but creating the growth, prosperity, which would give higher revenues, but with lower rates.  If you believe in lower rates and a broader base, you must vote for the proposition that the rich are taxed enough.  Thank you. [applause]\"]\n",

      "['Arthur Kellermann:', 'Peter Singer:']\n",
      "[\"John, we save a lot more lives than we lose, but we deal with the issues we're going to debate tonight far more often than anyone realizes. John Donvan Okay, and your partner, Peter Singer. [applause] Peter is a professor of bioethics at Princeton, and you wrote in the New York Times a few years back that a system of rationing care should include measures of the quality of life but not judgments about moral character or social value.  Why not?\", 'As you hear from each of us tonight, I urge you to not only listen to our arguments, but consider our different backgrounds and our different interests.  Since 2010, I\\'ve worked for the RAND Corporation.  RAND is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization that\\'s dedicated to objective analysis of some of the toughest policy questions confronting our country and the world.  RAND analysts are expected to be dispassionate and detached.  That\\'s not a good way to win an \"Intelligence Squared\" debate. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - [laughter] So this morning I advised RAND I was taking a day of annual leave.  And I\\'m here tonight not as a RAND analyst but as an ER doctor. Who, as John said, worked for 25 years taking care of severely ill, injured, and dying patients in some of our nation\\'s busiest ERs.  The goal of emergency medicine is always to save lives.  But you would be surprised how often we have to make decisions in consultation with patients and their families about whether or not initiating heroic measures is, in fact, the right thing to do and what the patient really wants.  It happens when a critically ill patient is rushed to the ER in the very last stages of a terminal illness. And that usually happens when the patient\\'s personal physician, well, they never got around to having the conversation.  They never got around to talking with the patient about, \"What will they want us to do when they reach that point?\"  So we end up having that conversation with the patient or with their loved ones at 2:00 in the morning in a family conference room or at the bedside. Now, from a medical or a business perspective, the easiest thing to do, by far, is just full- court press.  Start resuscitation, incubate the patient, roll out the breathing machine, put in IV lines.  But, you know, it doesn\\'t always accomplish what we want.  And rather than prolonging life, it simply prolongs the process of dying.  That\\'s why when \"Intelligence Squared\" called me and asked if I would do this debate tonight, my answer was an immediate yes, not only because of what the patient goes through, but what their family goes through too. Now, to clarify what we\\'re debating tonight, I think it\\'s important for us to define just what we mean.  What kind of end-of-life care are we talking about?  Medical and surgical treatments that do not achieve a reasonable goal of medicine should not be used. Limiting this type of care is not rationing; it\\'s good medicine.  Many treatments are used to achieve goals that patients did not want or were not proportionate to the burdens that the treatment imposed, because there was either ineffective communication about the disease prognosis, there is a failure to achieve adequate informed patient consent, or there was no advanced care planning.  Avoiding these treatments is not rationing; it\\'s simply rectifying poor-quality care. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - And some treatments are deserved, but they\\'re extremely costly and have a very low chance of success.  Declining to pay for such treatments is what most people would consider rationing.  And my teammate, Professor Singer, will have more to say about that in a minute.  But I do think there is one type of end-of-life care that is not used often enough. It\\'s relatively inexpensive.  It\\'s highly valued by patients.  And it\\'s effective.  It\\'s palliative care.  Palliative care is specialized care that\\'s focused on relieving pain, relieving the burden of symptoms, helping the patient to be as comfortable and as functional as they can be as they approach the last days of their lives.  Now, two years ago, a group of cancer specialists published an amazing study in the \"New England Journal of Medicine.\" They took a group of patients with a very serious type of lung cancer.  And they randomly assigned them to two treatment groups.  One treatment group got palliative care and standard cancer treatment.  The other group got very aggressive, advanced cancer care.  And they followed the two groups.  The palliative care group not only had a better quality of life and less depression prior to their death. They lived longer than the group that got aggressive treatment.  This past August another team followed nearly 400 cancer patients during their last months in life.  Those that avoided hospitalization and avoided the intensive care unit were less worried. Those who prayed or meditated, those who were visited by their pastor in the hospital or in clinic, those who felt they had a strong bond with their doctors were happier, had higher quality of life and did better in the last days that they had on this earth.  So at the outset of this debate, let\\'s assume that our opponents did not come here to defend bad medicine.  And you can be confident that Professor Singer and I did not come here to advocate limiting access to palliative care.  So that leaves us with a pretty narrow set of situations in a highly charged question:  Do patients in the last stages of terminal illness have an unqualified right to extremely costly treatments of uncertain value for as long as they want? Because if the answer is yes, the rest of us have to be prepared to pay the price. Despite remarkable progress of medical science, the global death rate is still 100 percent. [laughter] So the question is not whether we\\'re going to live or die.  The question is where and how we\\'ll die and who will be with us when we do.  Most of us don\\'t want to die in an Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - intensive care unit strapped to a bed under fluorescent lights separated from our loved ones.  Yet that\\'s precisely what happens to too many of us because all too often our healthcare system is too focused on making money, too preoccupied with its technical prowess and too busy to sit down with a patient and have an honest, thoughtful, candid conversation about prognosis and the patient\\'s wishes at the end of life.  As a physician, my goals are simple:  To save as many lives as I can, to ease pain and suffering when I cannot, and always, always treat my patients with compassion and respect. That\\'s why at the end of this evening I urge you to vote for the proposition.  Thank you. [applause] John Donvan Now, arguing against the motion, Sally Pipes.  She is president and chief executive officer of the Pacific Research Institute.  She also writes a weekly health column for forbes.com and is the author of \"The Pipes Plan:  The Top Ten Ways to Dismantle and Replace Obama Care.\"  Ladies and gentlemen, Sally Pipes. [applause]', \"I just got to get a couple of things sorted out here.  I'm easily confused. [laughter] First of all, I want to make sure I came to the right debate tonight because I came here to debate whether -- how we approach end-of-life care.  I did not -- I just want to make sure I'm at the right debate, because I'm not here to debate Solyndra, Wall Street, ObamaCare, or the presidential election. [applause] I'm just confused, but I'm southern, and we're easily confused.  So second question is are we here to debate an elderly person's right to super expensive care paid for by the government versus simply very expensive care that we all agree is probably a reasonable deal, or are we here to debate whether or not poor people and other folks can get decent care versus no care, because I personally believe in the sanctity of life, but I think the sanctity of life extends beyond birth and goes all the way up and doesn't sort of kick in again the last few weeks before death. It extends throughout life for the uninsured, the poor, and working class folks, too. And they should be part of this discussion.\", \"I'm real glad I got a chance to talk. [laughter] Arthur Kellermann: Let's talk for just a moment about exhibit A, Sally.  As a doctor, I've got to tell you, I've heard that story before.  And I don't think \", \"Oh, yes.  The story earlier about your mother not getting the colonoscopy she needed. And I feel badly about what happened.  But I have to tell you, I don't think a government bureaucrat was the one who made the mistake.  I think you got a bad doc. And the fact of the matter is -- I know this may come as a shock, sometimes Canadians screw up.  If they didn't, we'd never win the Stanley Cup. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - [laughter] Arthur Kellermann: And Mr. Connor --\", 'Yeah.', \"Yeah.  Mr. Connor -- I'm with you, brother, on the market incentive.  So let me suggest a market-based solution to what we're talking about.  I think there's a big difference between deciding what we as a society can afford to commit folks to get, whether it's in ICU at the end of the life or whether it's at 25 years old when you're trying to get your first job and starting a family.  And let's commit to that level of financial protection and coverage that we all kind of want to buy into.  If beyond that, whatever that is, whatever we as a country decide we are prepared to shoulder, you can buy it.  Sally, you could buy it.  If you want Avastin, and it's worth $100,000 a year to pay for it out of your pocket, and you want to use your children's inheritance, go for it.  It's okay with me.  But I've got a problem with you using our inheritance to buy your Avastin if we don't have the evidence that it makes a difference. [applause] So let's have a market-based solution.  That's the deal today that 50 million uninsured Americans get, except they don't even get a basic level of coverage.  It's all out of pocket, or it's on the charity and mercy of individual doctors and hospitals.  That's a pretty lousy deal.\", 'I know we take care of them.', 'Well, the only problem is that\\'s not how it works, and that\\'s not what we\\'re talking about. John Donvan That is what we\\'re talking about. Arthur Kellermann: I mean, we\\'re talking about, again -- John Donvan No, it is -- but, Art, it\\'s -- we are talking about having to make these hard choices and saying no to some people. Arthur Kellermann: Yeah, well, no, what we\\'re saying is we want to give everybody good, decent, high- quality, evidence-based medicine and care, including and especially palliative care at the end of life.  But if you want a super expensive drug or an unorthodox treatment, it costs a freaking fortune. And it is way beyond what we think as a society private insurances actuaries or the government\\'s actuaries or the institute of medicine says is reasonable, then we should not, as a society, be obliged to go along for the ride.  You should be able to pay for that out of pocket or in any other way you want to do it.  That\\'s a fundamental difference in saying, \"No, you can\\'t have it at all.\"  And let me remind you, we talked about wasteful spending earlier -- John Donvan But wasn\\'t Peter describing a situation in the U.K. where they do look at specific treatments and they say, \"If you want to stay in the national health, you can\\'t have it at all\"? Arthur Kellermann: Well, I\\'m sorry.  I thought we were in the United States.', 'Well, yeah, but let me just mention something that I think weve got to put on the table because I don\\'t know how much time we\\'re going to have, a cynical colleague of mine once said, \"Americans don\\'t mind throwing people overboard, they just don\\'t like to hear the splash.\" [laughter] And there\\'s an awful lot of people that are getting thrown overboard every day in this country that we\\'re not debating about tonight. [talking simultaneously] No, no, it\\'s really important.  Sally told a story -- I\\'ll just briefly tell a story.  Early in my career, I saw a woman in her 30s, a mother of three, who rolled in the door with a hemorrhagic stroke, her blood vessel burst in her brain, she was neurologically devastated.  We incubated her, we did everything that Sally and Ken would want.  We gave her a full court all out best we could humanly do, and we could not save her life.  I went to break the news to her sisters, and they told me that three weeks earlier she\\'d lost her job, lost her coverage, could not afford her three blood pressure medicines, and was forced to choose between groceries for her kids or medicine for herself.  She chose her kids like any mother in this audience would choose, and she paid for it with her life. Her life had value.  She died.  We spent more money in the last three hours of a completely futile effort to save her life that could have kept her in blood pressure medicine her whole life, raised her kids, paid her taxes, contributed to our country. Those people matter, too! [applause] John Donvan I want to take questions from the audience, but I just want to finish this up.  Should she have been denied that service since it didn\\'t make sense economically? Arthur Kellermann: What? Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - John Donvan The extraordinary effort -- Arthur Kellermann: No, because early on you don\\'t know how things are going to turn out and you -- but at some point you say -- and, again, what we said -- opening conversation here is the most important discussion to have is between a physician and the patient with an honest sharing of information, not get pulled into an industrial complex of modern medicine. Just remember, we were talking about the Affordable Care Act or Obama Care earlier. One of the first provisions that got knocked out of it was one that would have given doctors a little money every six months to encourage them to have a conversation with their patients. [applause] And you know what we called this, folks?  We called it a \"death panel.\"  What the hell was that about?', \"I don't know 10 doctors in America that thought that was a good idea to knock that out. John Donvan I'm going to let Ken respond.  I think you're going with the question, so, yeah, make it a question --\", \"Absolutely.  Sign me up.  And you know what?  And while we're at it, let's cut out the $750 billion a year that the Institute of Medicine says our health care system, the one I work in, is wasting due to inefficiency, wasteful management, missed opportunities for prevention, and fraud, $750 billion, folks.  We could do a lot of good with that money. John Donvan And right then and, if you'll wait a second, a mike will come to you and you can stand up, if you wouldn't mind telling us your name, and just wait for the mic.  Thanks. Female Speaker: I have a question for Sally.  Sally, you -- John Donvan Can you just identify -- Female Speaker: Right.  Oh, I'm sorry, John.  My name is Judith Alexander.  Sally, you were running through how many people are uninsured who could actually receive government assistance if they applied for it.  But aren't you being inconsistent, because aren't you against a single payer and yet you seem to be advocating that many of the uninsured take advantage of the programs that really are single payers?\", 'No, just -- we don\\'t do a really good job of giving chemotherapy and doing a lot of other stuff in ERs.  I mean, I love practicing emergency medicine.  That is the last place that poor and uninsured Americans should have to go to get their health care.  It doesn\\'t make any sense, and it never has. [applause] And it just boggles the mind.  I\\'m sorry.  I\\'ll have to recalibrate.  I\\'ve heard some things that have really got me spinning on this side and I need a moment to figure it out. John Donvan All right.  Sir. Male Speaker: My name\\'s Patrick Bachelor [spelled phonetically].  First, to Sally.  Your story was both tragic -- I think it\\'s irrelevant, unfortunately.  Obama Care is very different than the Canadian model, both in terms of who pays for it as well as how it\\'s structured.  But to the other side -- John Donvan Don\\'t debate the debaters, please.  Just ask your question.  Put the question. Male Speaker: Yeah.  The trick part of the question, I think, tonight is, do we really know what end-of- life is until we get there? Arthur Kellermann: There are many, many cases -- I never try to predict for an individual patient.  But what I do tell a patient is, \"This is the situation.  This is what could happen.  What do you think is the right thing to do?\"  And I respect their wishes, and I respect the family\\'s wishes. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 - But you\\'ve got to give them honest information.  You\\'ve got to give people a sense of odds.  Everybody is one or zero as an individual, but the odds and the outcome and the prognosis really matter, and people need to understand what they\\'re signing up for. Ken talked earlier about cruel and unusual punishment.  If we took prisoners on death row and subjected them to a week in an American ICU, the Supreme Court would rule that unconstitutional.  So it\\'s important to make your choice based on your values.  And my advice to you, sir, is to go home tonight and talk to your wife and kids and tell them what you want at the end of the life, so they\\'ll be there to represent your views. [applause] John Donvan I just want to understand, was the thrust of your question, \"Who knows what a procedure is going to produce?\" Male Speaker: No, it\\'s, \"How do you know when you\\'re at that point, at end-of-life?\" John Donvan Okay.  All right, so I think he just answered it.  Thank you.  Sir, go ahead. Male Speaker: My name\\'s Tom Oldfield [spelled phonetically].  Great job, everybody.  It was very entertaining.  I\\'m holding my phone because I wrote the question on there, but -- John Donvan Could you move the mic a little closer? Male Speaker: Yeah, absolutely.  Sorry about that.  Thinking in two hypotheticals.  One, we\\'re thinking 60 years down the road, and the other being that the stereotype that Gen-Y all think theyre special is true.  Which scenario do you think would be more likely? \"A,\" as a result of our lives being so special, that the pool of end-of-life candidates would become so extreme down the road that we have no choice but to make reforms, and have this discussion and ration life care?  Or \"B,\" would -- as a result of having such a comfortable life, would the -- would the effect of the suffering that goes on during end-of-life become so extreme where the conversation actually switches to people -- do people have the capacity for -- to choose euthanasia, for example?  Would there be a demand for that? Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 - John Donvan Let\\'s take Ken Connor first on that.', \"I'm glad you brought that up.  I really believe that if we focused on getting rid of bad medicine and eliminating the kind of errors in communication problems that I discussed and reinforced the sustained palliative care, that takes care of 90 percent of this issue. And the rest of it really does come down to a doctor, a patient and their family and what is meaningful and mattering to them.  There may well be in a point in society where we have to say that if the other certain amount of dollar value you can pay for it yourself that Medicare or private insurance or whatever won't go past that point.  But I'm never going to get between an American and their wallet.  It's my wallet or your wallet I'm more concerned about in that very unusual circumstance.  I just want to double back to the comment about euthanasia and say as a doctor, I'm not ready to go there.  But if a patient tells me, in their terminal condition, that they don't want an oxygen mask because they want to kiss their wife, I want to let them kiss their wife. John Donvan Okay.  Ken Connor.\", 'You just lost me there, Ken, because I thought you said earlier that what we wanted to do was to get government out of the business and let doctors do whatever the heck they want.  But you just told us we were wasting $750 billion, so I --', 'Okay, John -- John Donvan Oh, okay, Art, yes, sir.', 'I want to take your question as an opportunity to bring up another key point which we spent a lot of time tonight talking about economics, and we spent a little time talking about the uninsured and the underinsured.  But there\\'s another group that really suffers under the current system.  And those are the folks who are lining the hallways and in trauma centers and ERs waiting for the ICU bed that they can\\'t get into and are there for two or three days.  The ambulances are diverted from a trauma center to a non trauma center because all the beds are full.  We are not a country of unlimited money or of unlimited critical care capacity. And so my perspective, and I think my colleague\\'s perspective, is given that we live in a finite world, we want to do the most good for the most people possible.  And that should be our fundamental mission.  You can call that rationing, you can call it rational Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - use of resources.  But every life has worth.  And the fact that somebody got there first shouldn\\'t be ultimately the prevailing decision.  We\\'ve got to maximize the benefit and the value and the system to society -- John Donvan What\\'s the system then, Art?  Then what\\'s the system that -- Arthur Kellermann: The system is, again, you have to make decisions.  You work with families.  You have to figure out where -- John Donvan But if it\\'s -- does Medicare get to set up a panel to say we\\'re going to provide this particular procedure or not because it\\'s evidence-based medicine suggests it\\'s not cost effective.  Does Medicare get to say we\\'re not going to do that? Arthur Kellermann: I think Medicare gets to say we\\'re not going to pay for it. John Donvan That\\'s what I mean. Arthur Kellermann: Yeah.  I think if you say you\\'re not going to pay for it, people will go, \"Ah, never mind.\"  I mean, we know that.  The RAND Grant has done work for 40 years that showed that if people have to put their money on the table, they tend to make more careful decisions. And that\\'s just human nature. [applause] John Donvan Do you want to respond to that, Ken or Sally?']\n",
      "['', 'Well, I think that\\'s not the business of physicians.  I think they can judge.  There are ways of judging quality of life and life expectancy, but moral character is something different.  It\\'s too subjective, I think.  I wouldn\\'t like to see it used as a criteria in there. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - John Donvan All right, Peter Singer.  Our motion is this, \"Ration end-of-life care,\" and here to argue against the motion, first, Ken Connor. [applause] Ken, you are chairman of the Center for a Just Society, and you played a major role in perhaps the most well known case that centered on end-of-life issues, the Terri Schiavo case, in which the nation and the family was divided over the question of whether to remove the feeding tube from a young woman.  The governor of Florida was empowered by the law called \"Terri\\'s Law\" to become involved in that.  What was your involvement in that story?', 'Thank you very much.  It\\'s the position of our side that we are already rationing health care, so in a sense we can\\'t really debate whether we should do so.  The question that we can discuss is whether we should be open and explicit about what we\\'re doing, and, therefore, try to do it in the best, most thought-out way possible, which essentially means, \"Do it in the way that gets the best value for the health dollars that we\\'re spending now,\" or whether we should continue to do it in a way that we don\\'t bring out in the open so we cover up, that we don\\'t really dare to discuss. And we can see that politically it\\'s not really a topic that people dare to discuss openly, and as a result, more people will die who could be saved than will die if we use the money we\\'re spending effectively. Now, it\\'s clear that we are not spending our health dollars effectively in this country at present.  We spend about between 17 to 18 percent of everything we have, of our gross national product, on health care.  That\\'s about 50 percent more than other comparable countries, the other industrialized countries that we compare ourselves with.  There is no evidence, no evidence that we get any better outcomes for the extra 50 percent that we\\'re spending, the extra 7 or 8 percent of GDP that we\\'re spending, than those other countries. And Dr. Kellermann will give you a more detailed rebuttal to what Sally Pipes just said when she specifically focused on cancer in those remarks.  When we looked at not just what the health system does  but at health outcomes in America, we\\'re actually terrible.  It\\'s the combination of what the health system does and our general health. We rank in terms of health outcomes somewhere around the level of countries like Slovenia and Costa Rica.  They are countries that are much poorer than we are, and yet their health outcomes are comparable to ours.  And the other industrialized nations have better health outcomes, including, incidentally, Canada. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - It\\'s also true -- it\\'s also true that when you ask Canadians, as Gallop did a couple of years ago, and Americans, and Britons, people in the U.K., do they have confidence in their health care system, the Britons and the Canadians, 73 percent of them, just coincidentally the same number, say, \"Yes,\" they do.  When you asked Americans, only 56 percent of them say they do.  I think that there\\'s a general feeling that this health care system is not delivering what we want.  But as I said it is rationing.  It rations in many ways.  For example, we about 44 million people, Americans, now, who are not insured at all.  That number will drop significantly when Obama Care comes into effect, but it will not unfortunately drop to zero.  Now, not being insured means that you are more likely to die if you have a serious illness or accident.  In fact, Joseph Doyle, a MIT scientist, looked at people who were brought into emergency care as a result of road accidents, seriously injured. And found that those who were uninsured died at a higher rate even when adjusting for other variables than those who had insurance.  And when he calculated how much it would have cost to save these people\\'s lives, it would have been about $280,000. Reasonable amount of money.  But that was how much more was spent on saving the lives of the others.  But given that these were mostly fairly young people, in terms of how much it would have cost to extend their lives for one year, it would be about $5,500.  These people\\'s lives were lost because we were not prepared $5,500 for each year of life that we could have saved.  Compare that with the amount that those much criticized bodies Sally Pipes mentioned NICE, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom. What they say is too much to spend.  Apparently, NICEs figure is around $49,000.  In other words, almost 10 times, nine times as much as would have saved the lives of these young accident victims.  And of course, we ration in a lot of other ways as well, because some people can\\'t afford copayments.  We have long waiting times.  We don\\'t pay doctors enough for Medicare, and so they don\\'t take Medicare patients, or they don\\'t take so many Medicare patients.  So we are losing lives, and we\\'re losing lives that we could save quite cheaply. So I think we ought to be more explicit about this.  We ought to be prepared to say, \"Let\\'s use the dollars --\" maybe we should spend more dollars.  I\\'m not necessarily opposed to spending more dollars.  But let\\'s use the dollars we spend in the most effective way in order to save the greatest number of lives. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 16 - Something has to be done, because health care costs are rising here much faster than the economy is growing.  They\\'re rising at 9.8 percent per annum.  We all know the economy is not growing at anything like that amount.  So as that keeps happening, what\\'s going to happen?  It will eventually soak up all available spending.  But we know the government has to spend on other things.  On the [Intelligence Squared] website, in the articles that were posted.  There\\'s a very moving piece by Ken Connor about the plight of elderly citizens in our country, how they are neglected, and how because of the demographic changes, there\\'s going to be more of them.  Effectively, we need to spend a lot more to give our senior citizens a comfortable and dignified life when they can no longer look after themselves.  That costs money, and it\\'s going to cost more money. We cannot increase health care spending indefinitely and also spend more on the elderly and spend more on the environment, on education, on all of the other important things that we need.  So, like it nor not, we are rationing health care.  We are arguing that, indeed, we should.  That\\'s obvious.  But whether we should be more explicit about it, because we want to get the best results we can.  We want to save the most number of lives that we can.  And the way to do that is to be explicit and vote yes for this motion.  We should be rationing health care.  Thank you. John Donvan Thank you, Pete Singer. [applause] And our final debater will be speaking against this motion.  It\\'s Ken Connor.  Ken is chairman and founder of the Center for a Just Society.  He is a successful trial lawyer. He represented Governor Jeb Bush in the long-running Terri Shiavo case, and for several years served as president of the Family Research Council.  Ladies and gentlemen, Ken Connor. [applause]', \"It's very difficult to agree on dollar numbers.  I mean, healthcare economists try to do it because really what they're doing is they're comparing what you get for your money if you spend it on one thing, let's say saving young people's lives and what you get for your dollar if you spend it on something else, perhaps let's say for cancer where it can only extend life by two or three months at significant expense.  And I think what they can clearly say is we get better value in some cases rather than others.  We extend lives for longer for the same amount, or we extend lives for an equal amount for less money. John Donvan You said in your opening remarks that younger lives are less expensive generally speaking to save than older lives with the outcome of a longer life lived because the person's younger rather than older.  Am I reading you correctly? Peter Singer: Well, I think most of us would agree that it's a greater tragedy if a 20-year-old dies because they're in an accident and didn't have health insurance than if an 85-year-old dies.  I think, you know, we would feel that people have lived most of their life, achieved most of what they're going to achieve when they die in their 80s, let's say.  It's still sad, of course.  I know it's sad.  But it's a greater tragedy.  It's worth spending more to prevent if we can save the life of somebody who still has most of their life in front of them and still has a lot of things that they can achieve. John Donvan All right.  Sally Pipes I'd like your response to that in light of your saying in your opening remarks that each of us has the right to live as long as we can.  Does age come into it? Do the young -- do the younger have more of a right to live as long as they can than the older?\", \"But we haven't said their dignity is less or that their personhood is less.  What we said is that they have less years to live.  And that's a different question.\", 'Point of order.', \"Point of order. This is not the topic we're debating tonight, but I'm happy to debate it some other time. [talking simultaneously]\", \"That's not a very likely scenario. John Donvan No, it's unlikely to happen for anyone.  But do you have a system?  Or do you have the outlines of a system?  Do you have a philosophy about how this should be approached? Peter Singer: I would try to look at the number of years that we can expect to extend people's lives for a given number of dollars.  I would also try to look at the quality of life as well.  Now, that certainly may be affected by dementia, but, in addition, especially with older people, I would hope that they would be encouraged to state their own wishes as to what should happen to them if they become demented, or if other things happen to them. John Donvan But, Peter, assuming that you're correct, that you're not going to get the job, what body do you see making the decisions? Peter Singer: So I think, actually, although it's much criticized, I think that the U.K. model of setting up -- they have a National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Sally referred to it by its acronym, NICE.  Not everybody thinks it's nice.  But what they do is, they try to cost the various treatments that are out there, and they try to get expert data on how long those treatments extend life in a variety of different conditions, and they make recommendations.  They're not binding, but they make recommendations to the local area health authorities throughout the United Kingdom to suggest that this treatment does give value for the money; you should be providing it. But perhaps this treatment for this specific condition is above the bar that we think reasonable, and you may consider not providing that.  And the health authorities then reach those decisions. John Donvan And how often -- if you happen to know -- how often is there a recommendation not to use a particular intervention or treatment?  Is it uncommon, or is it pretty common? Peter Singer: It's relatively common that there are some treatments for some specific conditions that are considered too expensive to provide.  And I think that that's going to be inevitable, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 - because medical technology really has no limits to how much it can cost, and the drug companies can charge more.  In fact, drugs are much cheaper in the United Kingdom because the manufacturers know that if they price them very high, they're not going to be recommended by NICE, whereas here they can basically charge whatever they like, and they're still going to get users. John Donvan Let's hear from your opponent Sally Pipes.\", \"Yeah, but we don't support that system.  I mean, that's not --\", \"Well, let me just say, I mean, I've spent most of my life in Australia as you can probably tell from the funny way I speak.  And we have universal health coverage, but we also have private insurance.  It's not like Canada.  You're not out of the Medicare, as we call it.  You're not out of that scheme by taking out private insurance.  It just gives you, if you want to do that, extra coverage for various things that you can do.  So it's an option and Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - -- John Donvan All right.  I don't feel I'm doing a very good job as moderator tonight. [laughter] John Donvan I'm sorry.  Because I want to shape this back to what we're talking about as a tradeoff of what you get for what you pay, and are you willing to pay it, and is it wrong to deny that payment?  And I -- you know, Ken Connor, you actually did put your finger on it when you said that, he who is paying the cost gets to call the tunes on this.  And right now we are in a world where Medicare is taking care of an awful lot of people.  And it's very expensive.  We know a crisis is coming. Given where we are on that, their argument that at some point you have to say no, and let's figure out a way to say no, and let's make it fair for everybody, which is the principle of rationing, that if there's not enough of something to go around, you set up a system so that everybody gets an equal shot at it.  But everybody doesn't get all of what they want.  Just -- just that concept, what do you think of -- what is wrong with that? Because I know you think that it's wrong.\", 'No -- [applause] [talking simultaneously] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 - John Donvan But Peter used the United Kingdom system as an example so I think its on the table --', 'Well, if I can comment on that, I think what we are increasingly finding, and we will in the future, if you\\'re looking to the future, is that more people want to have the right to make their own decisions about when they die, about when they\\'ve had enough. [applause] Peter Singer: At the moment, people generally can say, \"I don\\'t want any more treatment.\"  But if there isn\\'t treatment that\\'s keeping them alive, they don\\'t have that choice.  Now the citizens of Oregon, the citizens of Washington state, have voted in favor of having that right, at least to get a physician to prescribe the medicine that they know will be lethal that can end their life.  The courts in Montana have said that citizens there have that right as well.  There are several nations in Europe that allow that and also allow -- some of them allow a doctor to give a lethal injection as well on the request of the patient, satisfying certain conditions like a second opinion.  Those countries are satisfied with that.  In the Netherlands, for example, that\\'s been the case for at least 20 years now. And through different governments, through liberal governments, through conservative governments, through a Catholic prime minister who never tried to repeal that law because he knew it was too popular and would be political suicide if he did. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 - So I think that that is actually something that probably is increasingly going to happen as people start to see that this is something that they want for themselves.  But that\\'s a matter of choice.  That\\'s not a matter of rationing. John Donvan I want to remind you that we are in the question-and-answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.  I\\'m John Donvan.  We have four debaters, two teams of two, who are debating this motion:  Ration end-of-life care.  Peter Singer, I had the sense that Ken Connor\\'s point wasn\\'t about voluntary euthanasia, and I think the question was also about a culture in which euthanasia becomes a suggestion overhanging the elderly as they become more and more in number and as they become more difficult to take care of, that this sort of -- I think the question is, will we get to a world once we open the world to explicit rationing where an old person will know that it\\'s time to get on the ice flow and get the pushout. Peter Singer: No, I don\\'t believe so.  I think there\\'s still going to be the possibility of choosing, providing, of course, as you\\'re saying, that you\\'re not imposing a huge burden on other people by opting for something very expensive and of doubtful benefits.  So there are going to be limits there.  But I think otherwise people are going to be able to make their choices in accordance with their own values, and there will be some people who\\'ll want to hang on to life as long as possible and other people who will say, life has lost whatever quality is had that I think makes it worth living, and I think it\\'s time to go.', \"Yeah, I entirely agree.  The decisions about living and about voluntary euthanasia should be matters between doctors and patients.  And that's why I think they're separate from decisions about costs and about when treatment is imposing so much of a burden on Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 - others and on the general health budget that it's not something that the public should be paying for. John Donvan So are we, or I, confusing euthanasia, which is a deliberate act to end life, with the withdrawal of an extraordinary measure which the patient hopes will save his or her life?  Are those two different things? Peter Singer: They are somewhat different things, certainly.  Again, I think patients should have those choices, and patients might choose that they don't want life support even though that is considered sufficiently cost effective to be worth providing.  But that should be a choice. John Donvan Okay. Peter Singer: But they are different. John Donvan Ma'am, sorry.  I didn't see you. Female Speaker: My name is Julie Goldstein.  I am a palliative care physician and educator.  And my question is to all of you, but particularly Dr. Kellermann.  I see first hand all the way till that happens, particularly at the end of -- John Donvan Sorry.  Could you move the mic just a little closer? Female Speaker: Sure. John Donvan Thanks. Female Speaker: And my question is, do you think that if we were to address the waste head on by education, et cetera, that we might save enough money that we wouldn't even need to feel -- we wouldn't have the need to ration? Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 -\", \"But it isn't just fraud.  I mean, the problem is that the financial incentives in the market system, that the opposition are defending all the way, provide incentives to do more. Here is an example.  The national rate of cesarean sections is 34 percent of births. There's an outfit called Intermountain in Utah healthcare that has a cesarean rate of 20 percent.  It saved $50 million by doing fewer cesarean sections.  But it cost it money.  It lost money by doing fewer cesarean sections, by saving the system $50 million it suffered a financial hit itself because the financial incentives are to do more and you get paid more, and you can pay -- you can build up your financial base, expand, stop, et cetera.  So this is the problem with allowing this to be done through the free market. We need something that puts a lid on not just fraud but also the incentives to do more medical treatments. [talking simultaneously] [applause] Female Speaker: Thank you.  I'm Peggy Lester. And I've been a nurse for 30 years in an emergency room here in town.  My question for everyone on the panel is if -- you know, the profit issue of all of this is what seems to me is what the issue is.  And so eventually I see it that insurance companies, if we privatize everything, insurance companies will come to a point where they're not making a profit, and that they will then begin to ration care, which they actually already do.  So I would like you to speak to, I think, any time we have a health care system that depends that everybody's going to make a profit off of it, we really don't do the best thing for everybody involved.  So if you could just comment on that. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 - John Donvan Do you mind if I tweak your question slightly? Female Speaker: Go ahead. John Donvan I don't think very much, but to ask Sally Pipes just, to your point, that ultimately, if you do go to an all private system, that private companies would have the same -- exactly the same motives to ration as anybody else, and that there would be rationing under the program that you're talking about.\", \"We've actually reached a surprising amount of agreement in this debate because both sides agree that rationing occurs.  Sally said there's always going to be rationing.  Ken said we are all in agreement that rationing occurs.  The question is he went on to say, is who should ration?  He says he favors rationing through markets rather than government.  But you should read that article that he wrote that I mentioned before on the website about the problems of the elderly because his approach from that article, all-profits nursing homes have on average 32 percent fewer nurses and 47 percent higher deficiencies than their nonprofit counterparts. This increased emphasis on profits has led to a distressing rise in neglected end of use seniors.  So I have to ask, why does Ken have such confidence in the market, solving the problem of the allocation of medical resources, when he is broadly, I believe, critical of what all-profits nursing homes do to abuse seniors.  We think that there has to be a better way than allowing profit maximization to determine how we are cared for. Let me just conclude by referring to the case that Sally began with, the sad case of her mother, and say that although that is a tragic case, obviously we cannot generalize from a sample of one.  I spent most of my life living under single-payer systems, either in Australia or in the United Kingdom. I or rather my wife, had two of our children in the United Kingdom and one of them in Australia.  I think that the quality of care that we have received in Australia has been outstanding.  I've obviously had medical care in this country.  I don't think that it's better than it is in Australia.  And I don't think that it's even more a respectful of individual choice because Australians can insure themselves in addition to Medicare. John Donvan Peter Singer your time is up. Peter Singer: Thank you very much. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 54 - [applause] John Donvan And here to summarize his position against the motion, Ken Connor.

      "['Painfully.  I was two inches taller back then. [laughter]', 'It\\'s a pleasure to be here.  Last time I did IQ Squared in London, I actually laughed so hard during the debate, I pulled a muscle on stage.  I will endeavor to be more restrained this evening.  I also notice that it\\'s impossible they didn\\'t give me a glass of wine.  In London you could actually drink wine will you did the debate. So let me just say, one, it\\'s an honor to be here with Daniel Pipes.  I read Daniel\\'s dissertation -- I think it was over 30 years ago now -- on slave soldiers, which actually is a very important and unappreciated part of Islamic history.  Daniel and I have actually debated this issue years ago, when a little book I put out called \"Islamic Paradox\" came out.  So it\\'s good to be here with him again. And let me sort of restate the resolution.  I think what Daniel and Zuhdi are really saying is that better dictatorship forever than allow the Muslim common man, woman to elect Islamists in a free vote.  Now, that\\'s a pretty, I think, ironic position for them to take, because what they\\'re essentially saying is they want to perpetuate the political systems which have allowed Islamic fundamentalism, including its most radical offshoots, jihadism, most famously al-Qaida, to actually grow stronger. It is no accident that Islamic radicalism has grown enormously during the period of dictatorship, secular dictatorship, throughout much of the region.  It has been jet fuel for that cause.  The societies that have been ruled by dictators and kings with ever coarsening, I think, rigor have very -- have harmed their societies, have caused, more or less, an ethical collapse. I mean, a good personal anecdote of this is when I was in Cairo and I was a student there at the American University of Cairo in 1980.  I can say that not a single woman at that school was veiled.  And that was a good thing, because they were babes.  I mean, they were hot.  I\\'ve never seen so many beautiful women in one spot. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - And 20 years later, I think it\\'s fair to say, under Mubarak, that probably 20 percent, or even more maybe, were veiled.  Now, why is it the social composition of that school hasn\\'t changed at all, these are women of the elite.  Why would women of the elite actually start veiling themselves?  Because they should be the ones who should embrace the dictatorship because it has allowed them certain social liberties that would not exist under an Islamist system.  I think the answer to that is that they were protesting.  They were protesting the political order.  They were protesting the social order.  They were protesting the ethical order, that it had become disgusting. And I think if you -- it\\'s interesting to then- to look North and look at where, I think, Daniel, and perhaps Zuhdi too, would once upon a time have said were the best hope for the Islamic world, and that would be Turkey. All right?  Because Turkey really had the model that everybody in the foreign policy community on the left and the right really liked.  That was the model that you would have enlightened dictatorship.  You have someone like Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.  He would come in and, through force of arms, literally, change the society, create the social basis for a more liberal order, and, boom, down the pike you would have liberal democracy.  Now, guess what\\'s happened in Turkey?  You haven\\'t seen the triumph, actually, of liberals yet in the ballot box.  For the last almost 10 years, you\\'ve seen the Islamist party win.  As the elections became ever freer, as the generals moved off, guess who became the dominant party, the AKP, the Justice and Development Party, which is an Islamist -- I think Daniel would call it an Islamist party. So what that ought to tell you is that under no circumstances are you going to create a liberal order in the Middle East without bringing along the faithful.  You cannot have a dictatorship who will take the traditions of the past and will take the ulama, the religious scholars, and throw them in the dust bin or throw them in jail. The only way you\\'re going to get a more liberal order in the Middle East is through people of faith.  It is through the fundamentalists participating in the system that you\\'re actually going to develop the jousting ethic that is going to allow liberals to have greater chances.  It\\'s only through them participating that you\\'re going to have people become responsible for politics.  Now, Daniel  another good book that Daniel wrote was actually about conspiracy.  And if all those who know the Middle East at all, you know that the Middle East is hobbled by conspiracy.  It\\'s known as toovtdie [spelled phonetically].  In Persian, they call it toovtdie jewy [spelled phonetically] conspiracy mongering, searching for conspiracies.  It is literally, as Daniel would tell you, it\\'s a Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - cancer on society.  Now, why do they have that?  They have that because the political order is dictatorial. It is what -- everything that is important that happens happens, as the Iranians say, pushte powde [spelled phonetically], it happens behind the curtain.  Only by people becoming responsible, by having, as they say in the Arabic and in Persian, masuliat [spelled phonetically], can you drive away conspiracy, can you create a more healthy order.  There\\'s no way you can have that under dictatorship.  You are always going to have dependent people.  You\\'re always going to have people who are ridden with conspiracy.  So if you want to create that order, perpetuate that order, what Daniel is in fact saying is he\\'s going to create an order, there\\'s going to be more conspiracy.  It is you have to bring in some type of Democratic system and allow these people to evolve.  And they might also say evolution is not possible with Islamists.  Well, we know, at least looking in the case of Iran -- and we don\\'t know yet what\\'s going to happen in the Arab world.  We don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen in Egypt.  We don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen in Tunisia.  But we can tell that in Iraq under a theocracy, under a dictatorship, there has been a profound change that you have fallen revolutionaries everywhere. I do not have time to go into the number of them, but it is an ocean.  It is a tidal wave of people who were once hard core Islamists who have abandoned the faith or who have evolved their faith and have become pretty profound Democrats, if not liberals.  They still exist in the dictatorial society.  But they are -- you have seen the explosions in 2007. You saw them in 2009.  You saw it in 1997, Mohammed Akbi [spelled phonetically].  So I suggest to you if you want to see evolution, you cannot be in favor of -- create a dictatorship which can only promise you stagnation.  Thank you.', 'Yeah.  It\\'s pretty hard to find an instance where you can find the United States successfully encouraging a dictatorship to evolve liberally in the Middle East.  Daniel said, \"I wish we had.\"  Well, of course I wish we had.  I wish we had taken the Shah -- had we put more pressure on him so he could have evolved and developed elections so you wouldn\\'t have had a revolution.  I mean, I just have to say this, Daniel\\'s premise is Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - that by the mighty hand of the United States, we\\'re going to discover these hidden liberals in the Middle East.  And suddenly, through America\\'s nurturing, these liberals are going to come forward and defeat the people of faith. I just don\\'t -- that\\'s not the Middle East I know.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  You cannot import into the Middle East liberal ideas and liberal codes of justice, Swiss legal codes and create liberals.  It has to come organically.', 'It has to be through the ballot box.', 'And who won the election?', \"No, I think you can push.  But let's just take Turkey.  I mean, Turkey is the ideal.  They elected an Islamist party.  I mean, what would you have done differently in Turkey?  As you just said, the 1990s created a more liberal order.  Guess what happens?  The people freely vote and bring in the Islamists.  So I don't see -- if Turkey's not going that way, how is Egypt, which is far less Westernized, which has been much farther from the European tradition.\", 'Yeah, I mean, one, the Sharia has been the rule of law for much of the Egyptian population all over the place for decades now. [talking simultaneously]', 'In the sense that the central governing structure had collapsed.  It wasn\\'t there.  I mean, one reason the Islamic fundamentalists were to come -- able to come in and have such growth is because the social order from the central government, it just basically ceased to exist and also because there are a lot of Egyptians out there who don\\'t have a problem with much of the holy law.  And I don\\'t think you get to take the holy law, as tried -- as you tried to do in other places in the Middle East, and just suddenly throw it -- Ben Ali tried to do it, just take it, throw it away -- you have to have it organically evolve. There is no other way, and I think you will.  I mean, you suggest with Mubarak that you could have nudged him.  But every time we tried to nudge Mubarak -- and the American government did try to nudge Mubarak -- he would say, \"If not me, then the Islamists.\"', '[unintelligible] make a quick response to that. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 -', 'My old friend and teacher, Olivier Roy, made the -- I thought the pithy remark where he said, \"If France had to wait for the development of a democratic culture, France would still be a monarchy.\"  The notion that you are somehow going to push off into the distance four or five years, and you get to four or five years, another four or five years, that you\\'re going to have suddenly liberals become strong and the dominant party I think isn\\'t serious.', \"Ayman Nour couldn't win an election in Egypt right now if the CIA had paid every single Egyptian $5,000.\", \"Well, Iran came to power through a revolution.  It was a revolution against the Shah.  I mean, it was a complete, total overthrow, in fact, within a very short -- the thing that you would want to ask in Iran is, have the individuals who initially supported Khomeini, who supported the idea of theocracy, had an enormous change?  You have.  You can't find a halfway intelligent cleric who actually supports the idea of --\", \"No, but they didn't -- they haven't arrived.  They have stopped elections.

What you\\'re doing is closing down the option.  You\\'re basically saying, \"You don\\'t get to have the right to have a democratic process.\"  And by the way, the Western democratic process, if you recall, was not terribly pretty.  It was really ugly, took a long time.  They\\'ll have to go a really long distance before they actually have as bad a time as we did.', \"I think that's all great and fine, and we should support liberal democrats everywhere. I'm -- you know, I've been in favor of covert action programs all over the place. [laughter] But I just don't see that you've got the traction.  And I don't see if you go to Mubarak -- Mubarak made a real hobby out of squashing liberals like he made a hobby of squashing everybody else. And Mubarak says, no, I don't want to do that.  And what's the United States going to do?  All right.  Take the money away.  Take the money from the military, and then he Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 - says, all right, you're going to weaken me.  The Islamists are coming.  You've already said the Islamists did come.  So I don't think you can create liberals in the Middle East out of sand.  There has to be a process, an evolution.  In the West, liberals were not born overnight.  They came into being.  It was -- I don't want to go through Occidental history here.  It was a very ugly process.  What he is saying is that, no, you don't get to have that process.  We had that process, but no, not you.  Muslims don't get to evolve.  You have to be born liberals now. [applause]\", \"I'm not sure I followed that at the end. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 - There are Islamists out there who are hell on earth.  And I can't think of a single good Islamist.  It's impossible.  That's really not the point.  The point is how you bring about --\", '-- how do you bring about a political system where you have evolution, where you have some chance -- if you are going -- you\\'re not going to get a situation -- and I think we\\'ve seen that since the Arab -- great Arab revolt started.  You\\'re not going to get a situation where liberals are going to win an election.  People of faith are going to win the election.  Islamist parties are going to win the elections.  So you\\'re going to have to take that as a given.  You\\'re not going to be able to have the United States come in there and dictatorially essentially say -- I mean, Kissinger made the great line, \"Democracy is great, but I really want to know who gets to win.\"  You don\\'t get to know who gets to win. You\\'ve got to go through the process.  You have to set up a system where you have a jousting ethic.  Fundamentalists have to fight with fundamentalists. In Egypt, the Nour party of the Salafis is absolutely morally repugnant, all right?  No doubt about it.  But they are actually in the process of collapse right now because they haven\\'t figured out how to handle the pressure of democracy yet.  The Muslim Brotherhood is having serious internal debates because they haven\\'t figured out how to handle -- this is all new terrain for them.  That\\'s what we want.  We want them to fight it out.  It\\'s not going to produce something pretty in the short term.  But what they\\'re suggesting, having dictatorship and somehow having the United States, oh, I\\'m going to create a liberal here and a liberal there and a liberal here, it makes no sense.', \"I'm enjoying Daniel being the neocon.  I'm enjoying this enormously.  You know, the --\", 'No, I agree with him. [laughter] For me, that\\'s a compliment.  You know, I have to say this.  It\\'s not a question of imposition.  I mean, what we\\'re talking about here is, in fact, people in the Middle East have absorbed, profoundly, western ideas. They haven\\'t, by any means, absorbed them perfectly, ideally, to the level that we would like.  But one of the things I\\'m arguing is, in fact, the idea of popular sovereignty has been absorbed through a wide body politic, including the faithful, including within those that we call Islamic fundamentalists.  If you can -- when I was in Najaf in Iraq and I was having discussions with one of the elder sons of Grand Ayatollah Hakim, and we were discussing what democracy was, I mean, he understood to be, in his own conception, ma\\'ruf, that it something that was sacred, that popular sovereignty was sacred.  Now, in the next breath, he said, \"I don\\'t know where the red lines are.\"  He had no idea where they are.  We have red lines, too, in democracy, whether they be about abortion or other issues.  We\\'re not quite sure where certain issues in our ethics collide, where we don\\'t want to compromise.  They have, for the very first time, this problem. It is great that an elder son of one of the senior clerics in Iraq has this problem.  That\\'s where you want to take this.  And it\\'s not a question of imposition.  It\\'s a question of they, themselves, taking the imports that they have voluntarily taken in and trying to figure out how they work out a more humane society.  In their case, it\\'s easy, given where they came from with Saddam Hussein, because they could screw up for a long time and it would still be more humane than what they had before. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 -', \"I think the best answer to that is, and the simplest one is, revolutions are bad.  You don't want to have a revolution.  You don't want to have the violence that comes with a revolution.  What you want to have is the transition that goes through elections.  You want to avoid, at all cost, the triumph of the military men, the militarists, the -- I would say in the Middle East, the real danger in the Middle East still in most places is not the Islamists.  It's actually still the military.  In that you want to have folks become responsible for their faiths as quickly as possible. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - There's only one way you do that.  There's only one way people become responsible, and that is through elections.  It is process of elections.  I mean, take Iran.  Iran has just - - they've had controlled elections.  But the simple fact of having controlled elections in Iran has inspired people to actually take them seriously.  There was a promise in the Islamic -- when the Shah fell, there was the Islamist strain under Khomeini, and there was also the democratic strain.  They are in constant tension.  And I would argue that actually the democrats have done far better in at least taking the intellectual train.\", \"No, I'm --\", \"No, I'm not a fan of Iran.  All I'm telling you is that it the Iran case is very interesting is because it shows evolution.  It shows, as we saw in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, you can have lots of fallen communists.  The notion that Daniel is suggesting that in fact Islamists stay as they are is false.  It's all depending upon the political circumstances. No one stays as is.\", \"We don't know until it happens.  I mean, you can't know this in advance.  There is no way right now that we can be certain that you're going to have many elections in Egypt and Tunisia and where else democracy spreads to.  That is going to be, you know, trial by error or by experiment so -- but unless you get there, you'll never know.  So you have to go down that path before we can even answer that question.  Now, I can give you a religious discussion of this, how I think on the Shiite side and the Sunni side, how Western ideas about democracy have penetrated that can give you some hope there. But I -- we just don't know until it happens.\", \"I think it's highly likely that if you have more than one election, that what you're going to see -- and you always see it with democratic politics, is that your aspirations become much more localized.  And I don't think that you're going to see any Caliphate.  I think the notion of that is a bit farfetched.  I think it runs against the most successful Western export to the Middle East which is nationalism which has profoundly affected even Islamist movements throughout the area.  So I don't think that's a big problem.  Now, you could find common purpose.  It's entirely possible that you will have Islamists in one country look fondly and affectionately at Islamists in another country and seek to support them.  That's --\", \"It's a mess.  I mean, the --\", 'Well, that\\'s because the primary -- the OIC is really about them saying, in a rather childish way, you know, \"Here we are; here we are.  Notice us.  We\\'re not the West, et cetera, et cetera.\"  The OIC is -- has been, in the past, sort of a concoction of dictatorships that, virtually, the only thing they could agree on is how much they dislike the United States, how much they dislike the Israel, and other, you know, less concealed forms of anti-Semitism. It\\'s -- I don\\'t really see that the OIC actually has anything to do with the democratic process.  It has a lot to do -- it\\'s sort of like an Islamic version of the United Nations, which I don\\'t recommend.  I don\\'t think it\\'s a moral paragon.  Most of the time, it\\'s not very serious.', \"You know, I think Daniel started off by talking about tactics.  And I have to say this is the part I simply don't understand.  I mean, he says we have dictators to push around and make evolve.  But we've -- they didn't evolve, and we did push them around.  I don't understand how you actually make a dictator become -- allow liberals to win in a democracy and deprive everybody else.  I mean, would that were possible.  But it's not possible.  Doesn't actually make any sense.  If liberals are going to triumph, they're going to have to triumph in a free election sometime. You're not going to be able to hold off an election and know -- you only get to have that election when you know that they are going to win.  And until that moment, you can't have the election.  Now, I think that's a recipe that any dictator can look at and say, I think I'm a dictator for life.  And I think I have to be honest here.  I think that's what Daniel is saying too.  I think what he is really saying is it's just too big a risk, so we're just going to have to keep the dictators more or less forever because unless you actually are tested at the urns, you're never going to know how popular you are.  And I would suggest to you it's only by being tested at the urns that you're actually going to begin to develop a liberal framework, a liberal process that makes sense.  It's only by defining yourself against those who are not liberal that you're going to be able to gain votes. I don't see how in the Middle East, where the region has been defined by faith, increasingly so under dictatorship, that you get to imagine a scenario whereby suddenly, through American pressure, intelligently applied, of course, because Americans always Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - apply pressure intelligently, that you are going to create a liberal order without coming to the ballot box and testing yourself. [applause]\"]\n",
      "[\"Absolutely.  It's like watching gravity take place.  You have a young population there, and what we're seeing right now is the start of something that's going to unfold for years to come.\", 'Absolutely.', \"Thank you.  It's really great to be here tonight, and I can promise in this debate we're not going to talk about the debt, I'm not going to talk about my grandmother, I'm not going to talk about your tax rates, we've got a really juicy topic. And I'm going to break it down into three main points, why you should vote in favor of the proposition and not against us.  Number one, no dictatorship can maintain the status quo that we see in the Middle East right now.  A vote for the proposition would be a vote to accept reality.  A vote against the proposition is a vote to stick your headiu Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - in the sand.  Although I suspect much of the debate tonight will focus on the Middle East and North Africa, it's important to note that this region of the world actually represents a minority in the vast Muslim world.  It's about 20 percent of the entire population of Muslims in the world.  Six in 10 Muslims actually live in the Asia-Pacific region.  Muslim majority countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have activist Islamist political parties and systems that work.  So the debate over whether Islam and democracy is compatible is the persistent charm of an irrelevant question, one that's no longer relevant. In the Middle East right now we're in the very early stages of a transition that I think will last for years.  And a year and a half into these uprisings we've only seen four leaders fall out of about 19 or 20, depending how you add them up.  And you've seen only serious infighting in the five or six countries, but you look at the crushing demographic political and economic conditions that these countries face, no dictator can hold that back.  And I think you look at the political dynamics in places like Egypt and Tunisia, it's quite natural to see why Islamists did very well for reasons that were well explained.  They were suppressed, and the debates in these societies were pushed to the dark corners of the mosques.  And that debate was radicalized, and, yes, there is a threat from radicalized Islam.  But it is the consequence of dictatorships, the very thing that if you vote against the proposition you will be voting in favor of that and continuing that sort of system. It's simply not sustainable.  Number two, elected Islamists will change in response to the politics.  And I think tonight we'll talk a lot about statements that elected Islamists will say.  What I'm focused on are the people, and I lived over there, and I understand that the basic needs, basic security, jobs, and other things will drive politics, maybe not in the early stages, maybe when things get a little rough they'll be a little ideological, but, by and large, Islamist politicians will be politicians, and we will need to support this long effort to actually push them to face the same pressures and constraints that other politicians face around the world.  And the open debates that we have like the open debate we're having here tonight in Intelligence Squared, I think this forum is phenomenal.  I've watched it now a number of times.  And these sorts of open debates expose the voices of fear, expose the voices of hatred and demonization in ways that I think clarify. And this is what these societies in the Middle East are just starting to experience.  So, again, a vote for the proposition is a vote for the possibility of change in these societies. A vote against it, it's for the status quo, which, as we said, is unsustainable and has harmed us.  Now, I hope we get into this debate over a liberal democracy.  You talked about it a little bit early on.  And certainly we shouldn't be nave.  There's a very real risk Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - that if we simplistically define democracy as the ballot box and going to the ballot box, you could see Christian minorities, other religious minorities, women see their rights suffer.  But my argument, again, against that and against the arguments of one man, one vote, one time, which is often brought up, is that that threat in the context of this debate tonight, the proposition you have to vote for or against, there's an inherent contradiction there, because if the biggest threat resulting from elected Islamists is a dictatorship that imposes upon the human rights and basic rights of individuals, you've got a dictatorship. So at the core of the argument of our opponents tonight is that contradiction we need to deal with.  Third point, elected Islamists, not dictators, will defeat the radical ideologies of groups like al-Qaida.  Now, I think we've done a damn good job over the last three or four years going after al-Qaida, and I know that's a debatable proposition among a lot of people.  But I think the targeted strikes and other things, that's a separate debate, which I hope Intelligence Squared has.  But if you look at what's going on ideologically in the battle of ideas, al-Qaida, over the last three decades, essentially, has tried to build its ideological platform on two core pillars.  Number one, tapping the popular discontent with dictators.  Number two, anti-Americanism.  That's a combustible mix, and breaking that, and having the people in the region break that, I think, is extremely powerful. The fact that al-Qaida and its affiliates had virtually nothing with the removal of leaders in places like Egypt and Tunisia and the widespread calls for political reform and the battles that are still going, I think, is telling.  The fact that Ayman Zawahiri, the head of al-Qaida, wrote a book attacking the Muslim Brotherhood for actually participating in democratic politics is telling.  Looking ahead, it seems that al-Qaida's popular appeal, I think, will remain low, given that many of the protesters are out there supporting democratic reforms.  People are going to the ballot box, the very thing that radical jihadists are opposed to. So I'm going to close up here.  I must say that we're faced with a great opportunity here. The popular uprisings in the Middle East.  And, again, we'll probably focus on that, because it's the hot topic, and it's the most uncertain, and Reuel and I agree that there's no clear path forward.  And I think we're probably going to have a couple of steps back. We're going to see these countries fight with this all along.  But tonight, if you vote against this motion, your vote is essentially saying -- remember those good old days when Muammar Gaddafi was in power in Libya?  Remember those good old days? Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - Remember when he repressed and killed thousands of his own citizens, when he actually used the veil of Islamism at different times and passed laws in the name of Islam to try to establish his credibility?  Remember Muammar Gaddafi used terrorists who actually bombed airlines and killed hundreds of Americans around the world, setting off the sorts of things that I think we're debating here tonight.  Remember that? Then vote against the proposition.  A vote for the proposition, is it a clear, certain proposition that we're going to see liberal democracy appear?  I can't guarantee you that.  But I actually think it's a better pathway forward than sticking with dictatorships. Thank you.\", \"Well, I think the notion that we could work with dictators today in 2012 and pressure them and things like this, it's quaint to me.  It sounds like the Cold War.  It sounds like a 20th century idea that worked back then but doesn't understand statecraft as it is today, doesn't understand power as it is today.  And I think we see this on full display with our colleagues here who are debating against this motion.  Zuhdi equated fighting against theocracy with fighting against elected Islamists.  And Ive got to tell you, there's a big gap between those two.  And I also got to tell you that I think when I listen to them present their arguments, not only do they think that the people of the Middle East are foolish and will just listen to elected Islamists and reelect them blindly, I think they think you're foolish tonight because I think the biggest argument that could be made is -- -- and it's not about the leaders or what Morsi says and what he might not say -- when I see Egypt today, Egypt after Mubarak is an Egypt where there're multiple centers of power that are competing for this.  And they're fighting with each other.  And, yes, Islamists did well in the first round of elections.  But guess what?  I actually think in the next round of elections you're going to see even more competitive space here.  You stick with dictatorships, you don't let Islamists go out there and make fools of themselves in the way that I think elected democracies open up that space --\", \"-- then we're going to have the same old, same old.\", 'Can I --', 'It\\'s absolutely incorrect.  We\\'re not saying vote for these Islamists.  We\\'re saying, \"Vote for the possibility of competition in these politics.\"  And that\\'s an oversimplification right there.  And I think it\\'s an oversimplification to say that this current U.S. administration supported Islamists over any other thing.  They\\'ve supported the openness and people having a voice in their own debates.', \"It wouldn't have happened.\", \"Which is the result of a dictatorship.  If I take your formula -- and I respect your formula. I don't agree with it.  But if I take your formula, Zuhdi and Daniel, you got to rely on the goodwill of Bashar al-Assad to sit down with secular liberals and give up power and actually open up the political system.  That's your formula right now.  You've been relying on that for years.\", \"And the al-Qaida elements which I'm worried about in Syria, in the opposition, are the product of decades of that dictatorship that you're arguing for tonight.\", \"Yeah, I started out my presentation talking about the vast majority of Muslims living in South Asia.  Indonesia, the number one largest Muslim country in the world.  Prime examples of where Islamists ran as political parties and they failed. They failed.  And their populations actually voted them out.  You have -- they are weakened, because they didn't deliver, and I think the central premise that you guys have is that elected Islamists don't change or morph, or somehow don't become like other politicians.  Well, guess what -- they do, when you actually have open systems. We see this in Turkey too.  And I think there -- steps forward and steps backward on Turkey's democracy, but by and large, Turkey, I think, is a much more sustainable proposition than what Daniel was talking about back in the Cold War era, back in the 20th century.  We're in the 21st century.\", \"We've got to deal with these realities.\", \"Oh, absolutely not.  I mean, especially elected Islamists.  And again, we're at the early stage of an experiment here in many of these countries. But just look at the facts.  Look at countries that are Muslim majority.  And again, I hate to bring up Indonesia again.  But bring that up again, and they change.  They morph, they modify.  I see it in Egypt already.  And again, we're in the early stages.  It's hard to Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - game this out.  But you have different strands of Islamism even within the Muslim Brotherhood, which we paint Islamists.  And this is sort of like a nice tactic people like to do is lump 1.6 billion Muslims all together and talk about sort of political Islam in some sort of way and make us believe that these people, the constituents, are fools and that they'll just blindly follow some sort of theology here.\", \"They're not at all, and [unintelligible] modify --\", \"Look, I think they have a greater possibility to morph now than if they were facing Saddam Hussein who killed hundreds of thousands of people, more possibility in places like Tunisia to morph than they did in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi, when you had organized mass murder. And let's be clear about this.  I want to stress this.  The transition in the Middle East is in the very early stages, sorts of violence that we saw and we've been talking about, that killed our ambassador in Libya, those extremists that killed him and murdered him, those sorts of things -- we need to recognize that those threats have not been completely eradicated.  We also need to recognize that the large protests against those extremists in Libya would never have actually happened under Muammar Gaddafi.  We need to recognize that there's a space there, that I'm not in favor of elected Islamists or liberals or anything.  I'm in favor of systemic change that has legitimacy.  And I think this is a key distinction between what Reuel and I are saying and what the other team is saying.  We can't implant this. We need to recognize the reality that because of the dysfunction caused by dictatorships for decades, you're going to have this first early result.  And, yes, there's still going to be violence and risks, but I actually think it's less than what we saw in terms of the hundreds of thousands killed by the dictators in these countries.  And I actually think the more that you have popular reaction of the sort that we saw in the streets of Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 - Benghazi against those murderers, you have I think a possibility then to push them and further marginalize them in that debate.\", \"Actually, I didn't say that there are no innate liberals.  And I lived and worked for five years in the Middle East.  I go to Pakistan frequently.  I talk to them all of the time. They're fighting that struggle.  And I'll tell you right now, Pakistan's at an interesting moment that everybody's negative about Pakistan and what's going on.  There's an interesting dynamic that's been underplay there.  And you've seen this.  And I was there in 2009 when there was Sufi Mohammed, the head of Pakistani Taliban group, extremist group. He said that courts are un-Islamic.  He said that elections are un-Islamic.  And this was at a time, a territory called Swat, about an hour outside of Islamabad, was taken over by Intelligence Squared U.S. - 39 - those very same extremists.  And I was on the ground there.  And the national outcry against Sufi Muhammad and the national protests against a video of a woman being beaten in that very same territory, the liberal and democratic response was there.  And you saw it in the previous elections in 2008, the MMA.  You know it very well, an Islamist party that said that they were going to ban cable television in northwest frontier Pakistan.  You know what?  You know what a lot of men love watching WWE wrestling in Pakistan.  These parties tried to rule theocratically and by a basis of religious ideology, and they failed. They were voted out in the ballot in 2008.  And as you know, not end of story, not end of story at all, because Pakistan is at a dangerous place.  But yes, there are liberals there.  And they are fighting against those radical Islamists.  They are going to have an election.  Guess what?  Next year.  And they are having an open debate.  That did not exist under Zia.  That did not exist under the dictators that ruled, the military dictators that quite frankly were backed by the United States, like these gentlemen want us to do.\", 'And that did not exist at all.', \"I agree with that, and I don't know where that -- I agree with that, and I don't know where that straw man is sitting.  The chair's not here.  I mean, that -- I agree with that notion.\", 'And I\\'m all in favor of that because I spent five years of my life in the Middle East working with liberals, with people pushing for human rights, working for women\\'s rights in the West Bank, in Gaza, in Egypt, across the region. And I\\'m in favor of it, and I think it\\'s a nice idea.  And I was against the war in Iraq, but the reality is -- and this is what we\\'re debating tonight is that good intentioned Americans who want to go in peacefully and try to orchestrate the politics of these places won\\'t produce the sorts of results that you expect.  What you need is the rough and tumble, the jousting that Reuel talks about.  We can help.  We were trying to help with the tools of, \"How do you organize?\" and I think this is a fundamental struggle in the next wave of Egypt because there will be a next wave.  The Islamists swept in this first round of elections.  There\\'s still a lot of uncertainty about the constitution, but there\\'ll be another round of elections.  And I do believe that American, European, and other organizations have a role to actually support these groups to become better organized.  That\\'s not what we\\'re arguing.  We\\'re not arguing for elected Islamists. We\\'re opening -- we\\'re arguing for open politics in these places, and it doesn\\'t come by invading these countries, and it doesn\\'t come by simply trying to negotiate with some of these dictators and say, \"Please open up.\" It comes through an organic process, a political process, that what Reuel and I are saying that in the first waves are likely going to lead to elected Islamists -- but that\\'s not going to close off the debate.  It\\'s going to open it up and lead to multiple centers of power in these countries.', \"It's a red line, and I think we see the dictatorship of Saudi Arabia as one of the worst offenders of women's rights.  And I think you see the places that have -- again, Muslim majority countries, Malaysia, Indonesia, and other places with Islamist parties -- respect for women's rights, like everything else. In places like Morocco too, where you have space for a discourse and a debate about this.  And in Morocco, they had Mudawwana, a code to improve the status of women's rights.  So a big debate is happening here.  And I don't believe, for a moment, that the rights of women under Saddam Hussein were a lot better than what we have today inside of Iraq.  I don't believe that at all.  And I think there's a fight that women, as long as they can go back to the ballot box, as long as there are institutions there, as long as there's accountability in the system, as long as women have a voice in those debates, I believe that you'll see, eventually, a more sustainable and legitimate foundation for women's rights in these countries. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 48 -\", \"This debate tonight has made me think a lot about the previous century and our century, the 21st century.  And I think we see a worldview on contrast here.  And when I hear our opponents tonight speak, I think about the 1950s in this country when we talk about -isms and Communism and lump large categories of people under one big banner and say that this is an ideological crusade; we can't deal with them; we can't talk with them; they're all lumped together, and no matter what, you can't do anything about that.  And I started out by saying that you -- we really have a choice here tonight.  It's either to accept the reality, a reality that the dictatorships in the Middle East and in parts of South Asia have fostered the sorts of ideologies that led to the deaths of people in those societies and right here in Manhattan on 9/11. And we've got a choice here today.  We can stick with that old system that is crumbling, a system in countries that have a population where more than half of the population is under the age of 25.  And change is coming, whether we like it or not.  And we can pretend like the system of dictatorships that we see in Saudi Arabia or in Iran or in other places, that we can work with them somehow and they'll open up, and that we'll actually whisper in the ear of liberals, and they'll bring about change in those societies. We can continue to pretend that that's the pathway forward.  I believe that the rough- and-tumble jousting of politics in these societies are the only thing that's going to produce the sort of legitimate change that comes from within.  It's going to take a long time.  It won't be simple or easy.  But I actually think we stick with the process of democratization as it's unfolding, or we continue on the current path that produces the sorts of extremists that we've seen.  Thank you.\"]\n",

      "[\"Well, that's simple.  The election laws.  The tax laws are a model of clarity and simplicity. [laughter]\", 'Yes.  And the IRS is reasonable compared to the Federal Election Committee.', 'Well, thank you.  I think largely what we have tonight is a debate about the First Amendment and what it means and whether we still value the First Amendment.  Do we want to keep the First Amendment the way it was written, or do we want it to say something else?  And who will say what that \"something else\" is?  First, let\\'s review what it says.  It\\'s pretty simple actually.  The part that we\\'re talking about tonight is Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech.  Well, I\\'m sorry to inform that we have a lot of laws abridging freedom of speech and regulating speech. The Supreme Court has said there are now 30 different types of regulations on political speech.  We have laws and regulations that come to -- close to 400,000 words.  But these words are not clear enough so the Federal Election Commission has already issued close to 1,900 advisory opinions that you must review to know what the law means. And on top of that, there have been nearly eight -- 7,000 enforcement actions by the Federal Election Commission during its history.  To really understand the law, you need to understand all that.  And the fact is no one does understand what the election law means.  In fact, if you want to speak out about politics and elections you have to hire a lawyer like this one over here.  I don\\'t know how much he charges, but most grassroots groups probably can\\'t afford it. And if they don\\'t have a lawyer, they\\'re probably going to make mistakes.  I lived under this, working at a political committee.  I saw the regulations firsthand, and we -- a lot of this we\\'re getting very upset with how complicated it was and the fact we couldn\\'t get an answer to many of our basic questions.  On top of that, in 2002 Congress passed the McCain-Feingold Act, and for many of us that was the last straw.  A portion of that -- not all of that law was bad, but there was one portion that many of us found offensive no matter what our views on politics.  Part of it said that within 60 days of an election, a group that you were a member of could not run an advertisement mentioning the name of a congressman if it aired on radio or TV.  That was illegal. Now, the court has overturned that, but it took them a number of years to do that.  I thought that was outrageous.  And there is no group fighting on the political front for the First Amendment. We hear about groups fighting for Second Amendment rights but not First Amendment rights.  That\\'s why I started SpeechNow.org because I think we need a group to fight for our political free speech rights.  Now, I designed this group in a way that I thought Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - would allow us to be effective.  In fact, one of our panelists who doesn\\'t support free speech -- unfettered free speech has adopted the SpeechNow.org model, which is now called a super PAC.  And basically here\\'s how it works.  It\\'s Americans getting together and pooling their money.  I talk to you.  I make the case as to why you should donate money, so then we can talk to other Americans.  That\\'s what the SpeechNow model was.  There was only one problem with it.  It was illegal to do that.  So the SpeechNow.org with the assistance of a couple of public interest law firms sued the FDC, to make a long story short, we won. That case, SpeechNow.org versus FDC, is what created the super PAC.  Now, let me explain how these groups are actually functioned, because these are different from normal PACs.  These are different from political parties.  These are literally Americans getting together independently.  The Federal Election Commission calls these groups \"independent expenditure only committees\" because that\\'s all they can do.  We don\\'t make any donations to candidates.  We dont make any donations to political parties. We don\\'t coordinate our speech with the candidates.  We don\\'t coordinate our speech with the political parties.  All of our donors over $200 are disclosed to the public on the Internet on the FDC website.  And all of our spending is donated -- is reported as well. That is what the media has come to call a \"super PAC.\" So when you think about it, what\\'s wrong with that?  It\\'s basically a group of people getting together and saying, \"Hey, we want to speak to our fellow Americans about what direction we think the country should go, what leaders we should elect, who should represent us, and we\\'re not going to give any money to the candidates or the parties.\"  That\\'s what a super PAC is.  Now, this model has been so popular that there are now 805 of them that have formed since June of 2010 when super PACs first became legal. Now, I want to tell you a story of how important money can be in making speech.  And I will go back to 1967, when a U.S. senator named Gene McCarthy wanted to run for president.  The incumbent president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, was a very powerful political figure.  Today most people would think it\\'d be impossible to take down a sitting president in a primary, especially if you started in November previous to the election year. But Gene McCarthy did it.  And you know how he did it?  He went to a handful of people, about five people, and they gave the equivalent in today\\'s dollars of $10 million, $10 million. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - Now, that\\'s the kind of money that we\\'re talking about in super PACs, but back then, the money went directly into Gene McCarthy\\'s campaign committee.  Gene McCarthy was opposed to the Vietnam War.  He wanted to make his run for president based on opposing the Vietnam War.  And he wanted to help build a movement to help end the Vietnam War. He couldn\\'t have done it without those contributions.  He couldn\\'t have done it.  And you know what?  He did it.  He didn\\'t win the nomination, but he forced LBJ out of the race.  And it\\'s the only time since -- since we\\'ve passed these campaign restrictions, we have never seen a sitting president removed by a challenger. And I daresay it probably won\\'t happen for many, many years.  So if you believe in the right of the people to change their government, we have to give people the right to do everything they can to speak to other Americans.  And independent political groups are the way to do it.  Thank you.', \"Well, there is really no evidence that votes can be bought.  The voters still -- [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - No, come on.  We -- out of 58 candidates who used 500,000 or more of their own money in federal races in 2010, fewer than one in five won.  So my point is simple: That money does not control the outcome of the election.  I'm not saying money isn't important, but it's just one factor.  I do also want to point out a lot of what you just heard from Jonathan is just simply wrong about the regulations.  He said, for example, we don't know how much is spent in the election.  That's simply not true. Any independent expenditure that is run in the election needs to be reported to the Federal Election Commission.  That is a law.  Now, you can argue about whether people are abiding by the law or not.  But they -- I think, by and large, people are reporting their independent expenditures.\", 'Now, there are other things, perhaps, that are not --', \"We're talking about a couple of different things here.\", \"What we're talking about here is the ability of Americans to get together as -- in groups together to speak to each other and to speak to other Americans.  And you can't point to a single member of Congress, to a single independent expenditure where they have felt this kind of pressure.  It hasn't happened.  And it's not going to happen.  Now, we can argue about the rules we may need to ensure the independence of these groups. But we think these groups should be able to independently raise as much and speak as much to the American people.  The difference between Americans getting together and speaking to other Americans is one thing.  Americans and contributing directly to candidates may be a separate issue. I'd also like to point out that before the SpeechNow decision and the Citizens United decision, there were many states, in fact a majority of states in the country that allow unlimited contributions not only to independent expenditure committees but to the candidates themselves. I think what we should be looking at is the quality of the government in those states.  And Pew, along with Governing Magazine, Pew Charitable Trusts and Governing Magazine, rated the states for quality of governance, efficiency of providing services.  And the states, six of the best managed states in the country were states where there were unlimited contributions allowed to these types of super PACs, and most of these states also allowed unlimited contributions to the candidates.  So good government, efficient government is consistent with people having full free speech rights.\", 'Could I just ask just a quick question?  So do we now have unanimous agreement on the panel that super PACs should be permitted -- are we all in agreement on that?  That would be great, because then --', \"You know, one of the benefits of all this new regulation and all these new laws that we've had basically since the mid-1970s is we've been able now to track how attitudes about government have changed. And what has been found is the states that have the strongest laws, the most restrictive contribution limits, the people have no more faith in those governments than the states where there are unlimited contributions.  This has no affect in the people's opinion about the appearance of corruption or the corruption of policies at the state level.  So it simply doesn't work.  If the idea is that people are going to have more faith in their government from these restrictive laws that are very complicated, burden speech, and prevent grassroots groups from forming easily, they simply don't work.\", \"Well, I would agree that we need to have more clarity about what's permitted and what is not about fundraising, candidates, and these single-issue PACs, and, I think, single- issue -- single-candidate super PACs.  And I think part of the problem is no one has asked the question whether a candidate can raise money for one of these single-candidate PACs.  My view is the candidates cannot do that, and they should not be doing that. And I think it would be helpful if that was made clear.  But the laws --\", \"No, that's -- I'm not talking about regulating the people.  I'm talking about regulating the candidates.  To me, that's a different thing. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 - When people -- let me say, the laws on coordination are actually -- they're not as weak as you make them out to be.  It's not just a matter of sharing inside information, although that's part of it.  There -- and it covers much more than independent expenditures.  It's any communication that's run within 90 days of an election is covered by the laws on coordination.  And a communication is considered coordinated if it meets one of just any one of five different tests.  One is if the communication is requested or suggested by the candidate or if you suggested it somehow to the candidate, and the candidate agreed.  You don't need formal collaboration or formal agreement to this from the candidate.  If the candidate or their committee or their party is materially involved in the decisions in any way; if someone creates the communication after one or more substantial discussions about the campaign's plans, projects or needs; or if they employ a common vendor and use any of that information, or they use someone who is previously employed by the campaign in the previous 120 days.  So --\", \"Well, I -- this is part of maintaining the independence.  I don't have a problem with that because I've said I think independent groups -- I think Americans should be able to get together and independently of the parties and the candidates, be able to speak about where the country should be headed, what candidates should be elected or what candidates should be defeated.\", 'These are the rules that exist today.', \"I think a lot of people say, oh, there really aren't any laws against coordination.  I mean, the idea that someone used to work for a candidate, it wouldn't be surprising that they would support the candidate.  They probably worked with them.  They've seen the candidate as a good person, maybe a good leader potentially. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 - It wouldn't be surprising --\", \"-- they'd want to get involved.\", 'Well, there\\'s -- first of all, I would agree with a lot of that. I do think it makes sense to allow candidates to decide when they file, as a candidate, what the contribution limit will be, if any, and let the voters decide.  So if they want to accept unlimited Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - contributions, the candidates can do that.  If the candidates will agree with each other to accept a limit, whether it\\'s today\\'s limit of $2,500 or some other limit of, say, $10,000, let them do that, and let the voters decide.  \"Do I trust this person taking these kinds of money from these kinds of people?\"  So I think that makes sense.  Now, there are lots of other laws and regulations. As I said, there\\'s -- the laws and regulations have 376,000 words.  For a lot of small grassroots groups that just want to say something about their member of Congress, as soon as they spend $1,000, they have to file with the Federal Election Commission. A lot of people just can\\'t navigate these forms and these regulations.  And then it\\'s not clear what they\\'re allowed to say and what they\\'re not allowed to say.  There are regulations describing what\\'s express advocacy that\\'s regulated by the Federal Election Commission.  But people look at the regulation and they don\\'t know what it means. And, in fact, we helped a group that had a question about a number of ads.  They submitted nine ads to the Federal Election Commission, and the Commission itself couldn\\'t agree whether it was regulated speech or not.  This is not a situation that is good for our country, where people want to speak out about what\\'s going on in the election, and they have to hire a lawyer to do it.  We\\'ve got to simplify the thing so the election law is not more complicated than the tax law.', 'Well, I -- the question is whether we should have tax funded campaigns.  And it\\'s very hard to design such a system.  I think there are a lot of problems with it.  I mean, we talk about disconnecting candidates from the people.  If they don\\'t have to raise money for their campaigns, we\\'re disconnecting them additionally.  But there\\'s also real questions of how you design such a system so that it\\'s attractive so the candidates will even want to do it. We have tax funded campaigns for the presidential candidates.  And in this election, both candidates have decided to forego that financing.  In other states where they\\'ve designed these tax funded campaign systems, they\\'ve designed them in such a way as to penalize independent groups that speak out.  Now, the Supreme Court has struck down Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - those provisions.  But it makes it even more difficult to design such a system.  So I don\\'t think it\\'s terribly workable, for one.  Second, I don\\'t think it\\'s politically possible to pass, either.  When you put together the words basically \"tax funding\" and \"politicians\" together, it\\'s not popular. People don\\'t like paying taxes.  They don\\'t like their money going to politicians.  They don\\'t like politicians generally.  So I think if we\\'re looking for solutions to try to make our government more accountable, to provide cleaner government, that that\\'s not something that\\'s probably going to work politically.', 'Well, I find --', 'Anyway, I actually --', \"-- found it kind of amusing that we're pointing to New York City's council as a model of clean government. [laughter] I mean, Jonathan -- Jonathan just described a system of tax funded elections that's the model they want to take to the rest of the country.  And we're looking at New York City's council as the model of great representation produced by this.  I, for one, don't agree with that.  You look at the quality of the law making coming out of there, and, you know, it doesn't seem to work.  So I don't think we want to copy that model.\", 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 - Well, since we passed the major campaign finance restrictions in the early 1970s, we\\'ve seen competition decline dramatically.  We used to see elections that were far more competitive than they are today.  The re-election rate has gone up not down.  But fundamentally I think what we have to keep in mind here is when -- who is going to write these restrictions?  Who is going to write the campaign finance laws and regulations?  Well, the answer is it\\'s going to be the incumbent members of Congress. There is no other way to write them.  And if there is ever a conflict of interest about how this is going to be written, that\\'s a conflict. They get to write the regulations so they probably will write them so that they will be able to have a better chance at keeping their jobs.  They\\'re not so much concerned about our freedom of speech or our ability to criticize the job they\\'re doing.  In fact, they would like to see less criticism of it.  So basically, this is a debate about who decides what you can say?  Should it be us the people getting together and deciding, or should it be the politicians?  And should it be the prosecutors who are looking to make a name for themselves?  You have to keep in mind many of these laws that are written not only have civil penalties but criminal penalties.  And if you think that\\'s far-fetched, the very first political prosecution taken under these laws was a group that took out a full-page ad urging Nixon\\'s impeachment for the invasion of Cambodia. That was the first prosecution under the campaign finance laws.  I would say free speech is messy.  But the cure of additional regulations written by politicians who want to stay in office is worse than any disease of free speech.  So I hope you will support the motion \"two cheers, or three cheers, for super PACs.\"  Three cheers for independent action by the people.']\n",
      "['I did learn a lot about politicians in my abnormal psych course. [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 -', 'Thanks.  I feel a little bit under qualified for this debate because I think I\\'m the only panelist who has not created a super PAC.  Although I briefly contemplated starting an anti-anti-super PAC super PAC.  It seemed too complicated to me, but maybe Trevor could help me out.  So I\\'m talking instead from the perspective of somebody who has been writing about civil liberties issues for about 25 years now.  And I see this as fundamentally an issue of freedom of speech.  Consider the legal situation before the Citizens United case.  Wealthy individuals were free to speak without limit.  Jonathan\\'s father, for example, spent about $24 billion during the -- or excuse me, million dollars during the 2004 election season to defeat George W. Bush.  And more power to him. Media corporations such as the ones that own FOX news and the New York Times were also free to speak without limit.  Parties and candidates could spend as much as they wanted on political messages, although the contributions for them were limited.  By contrast, unions, businesses and nonprofit advocacy groups such as the NRA or the ACLU, could not talk about their issues on the air close to an election if they happen to mention the name of a candidate for federal office.  Furthermore, as David mentioned, people of lesser means could not get together and pool their resources to use for election-related messages unless they registered with the FEC and were subject to strict contribution limits.  People often overlook what was actually at issue in the Citizens United case.  This was a documentary that was produced by a conservative group, Citizens United.  It was called \"Hillary: The Movie.\"  They wanted to air it during the 2008 election season, and they were prohibited from doing so.  Why?  First of all, it Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - mentioned a candidate for federal office.  She was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time. And two, it made her look bad.  Now, whatever you think about Hillary Clinton or about this particular movie about her, how can that possibly be consistent with a constitutional provision that says \"congressional shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech\"? The Supreme Court concluded that it could not.  And it also concluded that the First Amendment made it -- forced it to override an earlier rule that said you cannot engage and express advocacy if you are a corporation or a union, meaning you explicitly were advocating the election or defeat of a candidate.  You frequently hear a couple of arguments in response to this decision from people who didn\\'t like it.  First of all, they say, money is not speech.  Well, that\\'s literally true.  But you do need money in order to get your message across to a mass audience.  So I suppose Congress passed a law saying newspapers can exist, but they can\\'t spend any money.  Or newspapers can exist, but they can only spend up to this amount of money. Clearly, that would be abridging the freedom of the press.  Similarly, if Congress said, you can spend as much as you want if you\\'re a newspaper, but we\\'re going to limit how much you can take in from advertisers and readers. So once you understand that this is really controlling -- money in effect is controlling speech, I think you also have to recognize that loosening these regulations on speech does not mean empowering people to buy elections.  Why?  Because the messages that you pay for still have to persuade voters.  You\\'re still talking about convincing people to vote a certain way.  There are a number of striking illustrations from recent elections that show you that money can\\'t buy you love.  And I\\'ll just give you a couple of them. One from 2010, Linda McMahan is trying again this year.  She spent $46 million of her own money on a Senate campaign in Connecticut.  It was nearly a hundred dollars for every vote she received.  She lost by 12 points.  This year, Jeff Lake won the Republican nomination for the Senate in Arizona.  Even though he was outspent two to one, he won by 48 points.  So clearly, money is not the whole story. It is, nevertheless, true that in general, the people who win tend to spend more.  But it\\'s also true that stronger candidates tend to attract more money.  Well, what makes a candidate strong?  There are various characteristics that you can imagine that would make people both better able to raise money and better able to get votes, charisma, popular policy positions, but one of the most important is incumbency.  And incumbency gives people tremendous advantages in terms of visibility, the power to dispense pork, name recognition, and the reelection rates for members of Congress are Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - insanely high.  I mean, historically, in the past few cycles, 90 percent or more even in the last -- in the 2010, when Democrats lost a bunch of seats, it was still about 85 percent. So incumbents have this huge advantage and they use campaign finance regulations to reinforce that advantage.  One great example is the so-called Millionaires Amendment, which was part of McCain-Feingold Act.  It said that if you face an opponent who is spending his own money, he\\'s financing his own campaign, then we\\'re going to lift the limits on the contributions you can get. So this is clearly designed to help out incumbents who are facing self financed challengers.  Another argument you often hear is that corporations are not people. Well, that\\'s also literally true, but corporations are created by people.  I mean, they\\'re not created by robots or dolphins or extraterrestrials.  I mean, they\\'re created to achieve certain goals.  The question in Citizens United was whether people lose the right to freedom of speech when they organize themselves as corporations.  I think people tend to think when you hear the word \"corporation\" of these huge businesses like Wal- Mart or Exxon Mobile, but, you know, every one of us works for a corporation.  This debate tonight is sponsored by a corporation.  The groups that are complaining that corporations have too much influence over politics are themselves corporations, right? So you have to understand that corporations overwhelmingly consist of small businesses and nonprofits, not these huge businesses.  And they represent all sorts of points of view and take on all sorts of issues. Our moderator, by the way, works for a corporation, Walt Disney Company, correct?', \"And he had this privilege before Citizens United that most corporations did not, they were allowed to talk about politics on the air even if it meant mentioning a candidate for federal office.  Now, that was an exemption, a media exemption for media corporations, that journalists took for granted, but it's very hard to justify under the First Amendment because when you talk about the freedom of the press you're not talking about the freedom of members of professional news organizations, you're talking about the freedom to use technologies of mass communication.  That's a freedom that we all have that's guaranteed to all of us by the First Amendment.  So by lifting the restrictions on the money that people could collect and spend on political messages, these two decisions, Citizens United and SpeechNow, signal that freedom of speech is not a privilege that's reserved to billionaires or to media corporations or to Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - politicians, it's a right that belongs to all of us no matter how we choose to organize ourselves. And I think we're seeing benefits from that in terms of diversity of voices and greater competition in elections that we can talk about later.  Thank you.\", 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - Yeah.  I mean, actually, it often goes unnoted that in most states it was perfectly legal for corporations and unions to spend money on political campaigns even prior to Citizens United, and there\\'s no evidence that the states that allowed unlimited spending by unions and corporations were more corrupt than the states that didn\\'t.  You would expect there to be some evidence if it\\'s the case that money is corrupting.  That doesn\\'t seem to be the case.  I mean, it seems commonsensical that obviously money buys people\\'s votes.  But in fact if you look at the research that\\'s been done, there\\'s very little evidence that legislators are actually driven by the campaign donations they\\'re receiving as opposed to their party\\'s interest, their constituents\\' interests, things that might appeal to the voters who elected them. By the way, I find a lot of that, at least as troubling as selling your vote for money. I think that is something to be concerned about, selling your vote for money.  But I think we should be more focused on the actual policies being introduced by politicians.  And if they\\'re good policies for bad reasons, I prefer that to bad policies for good reasons.  So, you know, for a politician to do something like take other people\\'s money from around the country and spend it on some pork barrel project in his district and then go to brag to voters about this and say, \"Reelect me.  Look how great I am,\" he\\'s basically stealing other people\\'s money from around the country and using that money to buy the votes of the voters.  And to me that\\'s at least equally troubling. [applause]', 'Perfectly legal though.', 'I think there\\'s -- there\\'s a problem here with the definition of \"corruption.\"  I mean, if you take a very broad definition of it, it\\'s basically any inappropriate consideration, right, that causes you to vote a certain way. Well, some of it is actual quid pro quo corruption where you hand the guy a pile of cash and you say, \"Vote my way,\" and that\\'s definitely illegal, if you can prove it.  But if what you\\'re saying is that politicians tend to be grateful for people who support them, or to people support them, then it\\'s true, but that would apply to celebrity endorsements, that would apply not just to super PACs but obviously also to rich people spending their own money independently, which has always been legal, it would apply to voting a certain way because you like the way the lobbyist from that corporation dresses, you think she\\'s pretty.  I don\\'t think that\\'s illegal, but it seems improper.  You can vote for terrible policies for all kinds of reasons.  I think we should be focused more on the policies.  I mean, people vote for terrible policies because they have crazy ideologies that drive them to do it, you know.  So I don\\'t know why we\\'re focused on this one particular area where there\\'s potential for improper considerations when there are all kinds of other considerations that people might deem improper, and shouldn\\'t we be focusing more on the results, the performance that people actually deliver once they\\'re elected. Is it a good performance, is it bad?  And part of that whole process is being able to speak on both sides of that. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 25 -', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 - The problem with this standard -- this crazy standard -- and I grant you, it was endorsed by the Supreme Court, but it\\'s still insane -- the appearance of corruption, that we need to prevent the appearance of corruption.  So that means the more that Jonathan and Trevor go around talking about corruption and how horrible it is and how everybody\\'s corrupt and, of course, money buys votes and everybody knows it, even if it\\'s completely false, they go around talking about, now everybody\\'s worried about corruption.  That justifies whatever regulations they\\'re proposing. It has this sort of circular quality to it.  I don\\'t think it should hinge on the appearance of corruption.  Maybe it should hinge on the reality of corruption, although I don\\'t buy this argument at all that the fear of even actual corruption, quid pro quo corruption, justifies restrictions on speech.  And the Supreme Court has basically said it does.  I think they were wrong.  I think that they\\'re moving in the right direction now.  But I just don\\'t buy it.  Is there some kind of, you know, codicil that\\'s attached to the First Amendment that says, \"Except when you\\'re worried about corruption, you know, then you can restrict speech\"?', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - Yeah, I think, you know, there is an issue here.  I mean, it does look -- [break] Jacob Sullum: -- get rid of these limits on contributions to candidates then you can raise whatever money you want to raise for your own message, and you will be responsible for your own message, and you can't play this game of saying, oh, we can't coordinate.  I can't talk to them.  And you have to be responsible for your own speech.  That's not to say that you get rid of the genuinely independent voices.  But I think if what you're worried about is this sort of sneakiness, you know, it's kind of like, you know, a prostitute who pretends she's an escort, or you go into a head shop, and they got all these fancy water pipes, and it's for -- you know, for use only with tobacco or other legal herbs. [laughter] And you might say these are very dishonest people.  But in fact, it's bad laws that produce that kind of dishonesty.  So we've got bad laws we should get rid of.\", \"Well, I mean, this particular exception was just kind of pulled out of thin air.  But there are other kinds of restrictions like those that prevent fraud.  I mean, that's a kind of speech restriction, but it has to do with preventing a right violation.  And other -- you know, other exceptions like obscenity that I don't necessarily agree with.  But I just never -- have never bought this particular argument.  Seems invented from whole cloth. And I want to say one thing in favor of disagreeing rich people.  Is that how you put it, Jonathan?\", 'I mean, don\\'t knock them.  I mean, first of all, you have people of more modest means, as David pointed out, who can pool their money as a result of having super PACs.  But there is something to be said for disagreeing rich people.  You\\'ve got billionaires, you know, who favor Democrats, and you have billionaires who favor Republicans. You\\'ve got a bunch of rich guys who got together and put together a group called \"The Campaign for Primary Accountability,\" which I love, because what they do is they go around the country.  They look for entrenched incumbents of both parties, and they target them for defeat.  And I think this is a great thing.  And just to give you one example of what most people will consider to be a progressive outcome, there was a congressional race in Texas where Sylvestre Reyes, who was a long-time congressman, very comfortable, terrible on the war on drugs.  He was challenged by a guy named Beto O\\'Rourke.  I think that\\'s his name.  He\\'s a former city councilman.  And he got help from the campaign for primary accountability. And I don\\'t know how much it helped him, but it presumably helped him somewhat, and he won.  So you now have a guy who is written in favor of legalizing marijuana, written a book about it in fact.  It says we need serious drug policy reform, replacing a hard line drug warrior.  Both Democrats, right? So that\\'s an example of how rich people -- disagreeing rich people can -- can aid progressive causes. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - And of course in the Republican presidential primaries, you had Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich -- these are not the greatest examples, but they did hang in there a lot longer than they would have, thanks to rich guys who gave money to super PACs supporting them.  Mitt Romney had challengers who were different in some particular ways from him, not identical, in some ways better than him on certain issues, you know, it\\'s not a great group to pick among, but -- [laughter] -- but it -- very clearly they could stay in that race.  That race was more competitive than it otherwise would have been, thanks to the super PAC money.', 'Can I push -- I want to push this definition of corruption a little bit because I think --', \"You're talking about soft money, is that the deal?\", \"Yeah, yeah, I don't think that should be happening.  Is that the question?  Yeah, it should not be happening. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 -\", 'But seriously think about what you have in mind when you say, \"corruption.\"  There\\'s a guy, a state senator in New York, Roy McDonald, who voted in favor of the Gay Marriage Bill and the primary\\'s tomorrow, right?  So he is up for reelection, or he\\'s up for renomination tomorrow, and before he decided to vote in favor of the Gay Marriage Bill, he had assurances from gay rights activists that they would help him raise money to support his campaign.  Is that corruption?  And I think that your idea of whether that is corruption is going to hinge on your policy views to a large extent.  So keep that in mind. I\\'m -- you know, just think about it.', 'And also, how could we have done this? [laughter]', 'Well, I --', \"Yeah, just briefly, I did mention, I think, that they should get rid of the limits on contributions. I think a lot of the false independence you're worried about, this apparent dishonesty, the evasions and so forth, come out of that. And what happens historically with campaign finance regulation is, they impose one rule, people find a way around it; they propose a new rule, people find a way around that; and so on, and so on, and so on.  And speech gets more and more restricted. Regulations get more and more complex and intimidating for the average person who might want to get politically involved.  And I think we need to -- we cut our losses and make things as simple as possible.  I don't buy the distinction between giving versus spending.  I think if spending is speech, giving is also speech, or it amounts to speech if you restrict giving.  So there should be no limits on giving.  I am sort of on the fence about disclosure rules.  I think it's legitimate to require candidates, as a condition of running for office, to disclose donors, but I don't think it's necessarily legitimate to require disclosure for independent spenders.  There's an argument to be made that that chills speech.  In fact, it's designed to chill speech.\", \"Because that company is supporting a particular cause, you mean? Female Speaker: Yes.  Scott's Miracle-Gro recently -- Jacob Sullum: Well, actually, I mean, that's an issue that hasn't actually come up.  But that was one of the arguments that the Obama administration used in favor of keeping the regulations that were overturned in Citizens United.  They said there was not only this concern about corruption, but also a shareholder interest.  And I guess you're talking about a consumer interest, but it's somewhat similar. I think the answer in both cases is the same.  If you're a shareholder in a company, you don't like their political speech, you can -- you can sell those shares, or you can object at a shareholder meeting.  If you're a consumer, and you don't like the political speech of the company you're buying from, you can stop buying from them.  I mean, you can protest as well.  But you have the power to decide where your money is going based on that consideration.\", 'How many of you checked off the little box on your tax return that said you were willing to give money to that fund?', \"It looked like most people did not.  Is that accurate?  Who -- who checked off the box for that fund?  So right here in this audience, which I suspect is disproportionately in favor of this sort of thing -- you can't even get a majority here. [laughter]\", \"That's a great point because the response to the appearance of corruption is you just hide it, and then people don't worry about it.  It's not a problem.\", \"But yes, I think that is a problem because it hinges on something that may not be real. And this whole notion that underlies this, that you want people to have faith in your government ought to be controversial.  There's such a thing as having too much faith in your government.  Some people look at these declining ratings for Congress and the federal government, and they say this is terrible.  People are losing faith in the government.  Other people look at that, and they say, thank God voters are finally wising up, right?  And so obviously that's going to depend on your own views about how big government should be, what it should be doing and so forth.  But it is not an uncontroversial idea that everyone should have faith in the government.\", 'According to [unintelligible] corruption argument, yeah.', 'Well, and I think it\\'s the case, and David can correct me if I\\'m wrong, because it\\'s actually -- this is a small percentage of the money for super PACs that comes from these nonprofits. Kim Barker: I\\'m asking about the direct spending because a lot of these groups spend directly. Jacob Sullum: Oh, okay, I thought you meant donations, super, I\\'m sorry. Kim Barker: No, no, no, I mean, you look [inaudible], for example. Jacob Sullum: Right, okay.  As I said before, I think there really is a value in not having to disclose the people who are supporting these groups.  I mean, imagine somebody who supports, say, NORML and doesn\\'t want his employer to know that, or he supports NORML, or -- fill in your favorite group, whatever it is, you can imagine reasons why people don\\'t want their support to be widely known.  And, in fact, this has been recognized to some extent by the Supreme Court in a case involving the NAACP, where I think it -- was it Alabama -- wanted to force them to disclose all of their supporters. And the Supreme Court said, \"No, this is --\"', 'This hinges on freedom -- [talking simultaneously]', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 - The Supreme Court said basically, \"If you have to reveal who all your supporters are for a group that\\'s engaged in advocacy that\\'s controversial, that obviously has a chilling effect.  It chills freedom of association and freedom of speech, too.\"  So I think there is an argument -- a strong argument you\\'ve made against forcing those groups to disclose who their supporters are.', 'So during the first round of arguments in Citizens United, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart was asked, \"Well, if you can ban this movie, \\'Hillary: the Movie,\\' what Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 - about if you have very similar material but it was presented in a different medium, like DVDs or on the internet or even in books?\" And he said, \"That would be constitutionally permissible too.\"  This was pretty shocking, because it raised the possibility that the government could ban books in the name of fighting corruption.  It was widely seen as the turning point in the case.  They had a second round of oral arguments, which was very unusual, prompted largely by this revelation.  And during that round, the solicitor general, Elena Kagan, said the government had changed its answer.  She said there would be a strong constitutional case against punishing an organization for publishing a book, but that pamphlets were different because they were classic electioneering.  Well, that raised new questions. When does a pamphlet become a book?  Is it a matter of the number of pages?  Is it the kind of cover it has, the binding, or what?  Now, the media exemption that I alluded to before, upon close examination, looks equally arbitrary.  Citizens United, after all, was producing movies.  So why was that, Citizens United, not a media corporation? The NRA started a radio show, daily radio show, after McCain-Feingold was passed, and they said, \"Look, we\\'re a media corporation; we\\'re exempt.\"  If that\\'s legitimate, then why couldn\\'t every advocacy group do the same sort of thing?  Does the internet count as a medium?  Presumably it does.  Then doesn\\'t every group that has a website qualify as a media corporation?  This media exemption puts the government in the position of deciding who deserves to have unfettered freedom of speech and who does not, which is precisely the sort of distinctions the First Amendment is supposed to prohibit.  And whether you\\'re worried about corruption or you\\'re worried about undue influence, the arguments for regulation are just as strong, if not stronger, in the case of media corporations.  So while many of my fellow journalists have supported these kinds of regulations, basically lobbying to keep their own special speech privileges, it\\'s always seemed foolish to me for people who make a living by talking about politics to appoint the government as a sort of national debate moderator, because you never know when the moderator will decide that it\\'s time for you to shut up.']\n",

      "[\"That's right. My love for birds is what woke me up to the risks that climate change poses for bio-diversity. And I got involved in fracking because were not going to be able to deal with climate change unless we end our addiction to fossil fuels.\", \"To start, I'd like to bring the focus back to the motion that we've been asked to debate. We aren't here tonight to decide whether or not fracking is a gift or if it's a Trojan Horse. We are here to decide whether or not the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. So, what characterizes a boom? It's big. It's sudden. And it blows a lot of smoke. And the natural gas boom is doing all of that to an extreme. It's too much. It's too fast. And the hype is just over the top. So, why do I say that it's too much? The most serious health and environmental impacts of fracking are largely due to very intensive gas development. We have 500,000 gas wells in this country, nearly 3,000 in one county, 11 compressor stations belching carcinogenic air emissions in a tiny town of only two square miles. Our bodies and our ecosystems can absorb a certain amount of abuse and still bounce back. But at a certain point, it's just too much, and the insults overwhelm the resilience. Take Pennsylvania, for example. In the beginning, Pennsylvania was letting the frackers take their wastewater, which is contaminated with very high levels of salt, to sewage treatment plants, where it was diluted with the sewage, and then discharged into rivers and streams. In short order we had a water quality violation in the drinking water supply for 350,000 people. And what's more, Pennsylvania realized that if they continued to let the frackers take that amount of wastage through its treatment plants, they would salinate every freshwater stream in the state in a period of two years. The same dynamic operates on a global level. Our atmosphere can absorb a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions. But if we release too much, the climate warms to a point of catastrophic change. And the natural gas boom is taking us to that tipping point, because the way that fracking is done now releases very large amounts of methane into the air. And methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, almost 72 times as potent as carbon dioxide, depending on the time frame that you look at. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - A recent study showed that the leakage from fracking is about four percent of production and the scientists recognized that at that level gas loses its entire climate advantage over coal when it's burned for electrical power. The intensive development isn't really even good for the industry. Right now the industry is losing money on every dry gas well that's drilled. But it's even worse for solar, wind, and other clean energy sources, because they are displaced when the price of natural gas drops so low. The boom is not only too big, but it's way too fast. It is out ahead of the science. We do know as a result of lots of public pressure that some of the chemicals that are used in this process are toxic, but there are many chemicals that have never even been tested as to their toxicity, and we have no clue what they're going to do to our health or environment, in the short or the long term. We don't know where the wastewater that stays down below -- and that can be as much as 90 percent of the waste water in the northeastern shale -- is going to migrate in 20, 30 years or more. The development is also way ahead of the protections that we have. Instead of doing science and getting the safeguards before we move forward, we are flooring the accelerator and we're responding to crises. When you move too fast you cut corners and you have accidents, and that's particularly troublesome when you're talking about climate change, because the single most important factor for the social and environmental impact of climate change is the speed at which it progresses. We move too fast with climate change and we don't have time to prepare or to adapt, and so the climate scientists are telling us that we have to address the most potent greenhouse gases right now as fast as we can, and on that list is methane. The hype and the hoopla is clouding our vision and making it impossible for us to hear the facts. There are hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to ensure that this industry can continue to operate without the science and without the protections we need. $320 million spent on lobbying the federal government in just two years. As a result, what we are hearing now is not how we're going to end our addiction to fossil fuels, but instead, a hundred years of gas. Now, a hundred years of gas is based on extracting every molecule of gas from all of our reserves, even those that we haven't actually discovered yet, when it is well known that only about 10 percent of those reserves tend to be economically feasible to develop. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - And if we switch our power plants over to gas and our transportation systems over to gas, and our heating and cooking systems, and then on top of that we export liquid natural gas to other countries, how long is that abundant resource going to last? And at what price to our health and environment? The boom mentality produces magical thinking. The idea that this industry is going voluntarily to abide by a golden rule or a golden age of gas is just a fairy tale. This industry fights every protection we try to put in place, federal and state, often when it's even in its economic interests to comply. What all this means is that we are in the middle of an uncontrolled experiment. If we get this wrong, there is no turning back. And so we need to take the opportunity now when, we have a glut and we are not desperate for gas, to do the science and get the protections in place before it's too late and the natural gas boom that looks so exciting now goes bust in the face of the next generation. [applause]\", \"Well, let me be very clear either right from the start that neither of us have argued that it should stop right now. What we have argued is that the boom is the problem, that it's going much too fast, and it's outstripping both the science and the protections. So, we think that what -- for example, what New York has done, makes a great deal of sense, is stop for a while, when it's not necessary, we have a glut coming from other places -- and take a look at what the impacts are -- and figure out what needs to be done.\", \"Well, we learned, we have learned more recently. But the fact of the matter is, there's a great deal that we don't know. And the reason that we don't know that is that the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - industry has done everything in its power to keep us from getting the data that we need in order to really do the study. So, for example, I just submitted a Freedom of Information request to New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, asking them for the results of water quality studies that they had done in connection with oil and gas development in the state. And what they told me was, We don't have any. We don't ask for that. So, how are you going to do serious science if you don't have a baseline test of the conditions? And additional studies during operation? And follow-up afterwards? You know, we are learning something because of public pressure, but there's a long way to go.\", \"I think that we are not saying stop everything all at once and I don't think Kate is saying that either. We know that we need some natural gas, probably to keep the lights on for a while. The really big problem is that the focus on this industry and the power and wealth of this industry is actually derailing the attempts that we have been making in the past to put a price on carbon, for example, to move ourselves to an energy -- an economy that would actually be sustainable in the future. So, neither of us are saying that there aren't advantages in some situations between putting in a gas plant, say, instead of a coal plant, if we really knew what the lifecycle methane emissions were. And both of our opponents have admitted that we don't. And we actually --\", 'May I respond to that?', \"So there's not one study, but there is a variety of studies, and they rely on estimates of emissions that have information that comes principally from the industry. I know of only one study that actually went out into the field and measured the emissions from the gas well, and that study showed that our methane emissions are about four percent of production. Now, I agree that we could reduce those if we had better regulations in place, but the industry is out there fighting those regulations. We just had a new EPA rule  that was designed to address the emissions from the fracking system, and there was a new rule put in place that would decidedly make it better in terms of methane emissions because they would put the gas pipelines in before they actually let the gas go, and the industry successfully delayed the implementation of this green completion system for another three years.\", 'Eighty years of fracking is not okay. We need to get off of fossil fuels a lot faster than that.', 'Well, I would say first of all Joe was very careful to talk about national -- or energy security and not energy independence, and I don\\'t think that most economists and energy experts think that what we want is independence in the sense that we aren\\'t going to do any trade on energy issues with any other country. What they are talking about is we want to be doing that trade with people who are our friends. And part of what has happened because we\\'ve been so focused on gas -- and again I really object to the idea that the alternative is, \"Stop it now or 100 years.\" That is not what we\\'re -- that\\'s a straw man -- that\\'s not what we\\'re arguing here. But what we have done is we have ceded a lot of the industry that is developing, for example, photovoltaic solar energy, to China. And so if we are not going to actually speed up our development of the renewable energies here, and instead we\\'re going to be diverted into a 80 years of gas, then we are going to be at a point sometime when we don\\'t have the resources -- the renewable resources, and we\\'re going to be importing them sometime. That\\'s not energy security.', \"Right, but the question was, energy security. And the concern was being at the mercy of a country that isn't really aligned with our interests. And I think that we would mostly agree that unless things change very much, China is not the one that has completely bought into our value system. And so, we are -- we're not going to get the energy Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - security. We may get the cheaper panels, but we are going to be dependent on a hostile country.\", \"Well, I mean, there are a lot of things that we could do and we should do. But they're not happening. And this huge resistance to that is happening. And so, you know, there's a great deal of talk about this disclosure system that was created by the Groundwater Protection Council and the industry. And they're not disclosing everything. For the most part, they're disclosing only what is regulated as hazardous under our worker health safety issues. There are a couple of states that have now said that you must disclose everything to the Agency. But they are not disclosing everything to the public. And transparency remains a huge issue. You know, the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board Subcommittee on Fracking -- on which Sue Tierney served -- talks about transparency in a much broader way, so that we get the data about our water quality, and get the data about our air quality. None of this is available to the public right now. And we are involved litigation -- this very minute -- to try and get the court record from Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 - a case involving public health unsealed so that public health professionals in Pennsylvania can actually see the allegations and use them as part of a database to help prevent and treat health problems in Pennsylvania. And we're fighting the industry --\", '-- to try to get that transparency.', \"I haven't really looked globally. The answer to that question is how much fracking do we do? It varies a great deal, you know, on a local basis, and that's where the water consumption takes place. So, for example, in the west we do have major problems with drought. We have forest fires right now. It's projected to get much worse. In the east we have a lot more water than we have in the west, and the water contamination issues are more serious from our perspective than the water quantity, but on the other hand, if you look locally at, you know, head water streams where we have native trout, you can back up your truck into one of those streams and you can drain it dry and that has happened in Pennsylvania. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - So I can't say I really have the answer to your question, but --\", \"I would agree. But to me that means that you're agreeing with us that we need to scale back. Because we have --\", \"And it's great that we found this common ground, because that isn't what the industry is saying in New York.\", 'I know that. Thank goodness. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 -', \"No, she's talking about all of New York State, right? The -- you know, we do want to see every community protected, not just ones that have a huge amount of political power in down state. [applause] And we don't want to be in a situation where the industry is going into the most economically depressed, most politically powerless areas, and that's where people are Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 - not only unable to make a living, but they're now being asked to shoulder disproportionate burdens on their health just to keep food on the table. [applause]\", \"Well, let me just pick up on Kate's --\", \"But I was just going to say that Joe recognized Fred Krupp as somebody who he thought was reasonable and authoritative. And the Environmental Defense Fund has recently done a study, looking at the climate impacts of shifting from coal to gas, and I will tell you that they do find, they do agree that we would do better, assuming that our methane emissions don't rise to the level of four percent, but they absolutely disagree that if we shift our entire transportation system from oil to gas, that we are going to have net climate benefits over as much as 100 years. So I think we can agree that there might be a small part. There's natural gas buses in New York City. There might be small amounts, but shifting the whole sector over is just a non-starter.\", 'That\\'s not what we have advocated. So I would say, \"No,\" once again.', \"We have been fracking wells not for shale gas for many decades, but the shale gas fracturing, which includes two technologies used together, the horizontal drilling and the hydraulic fracturing, has been used, seriously, only for about a decade, and it's the impacts of the shale gas drilling that are driving all that opposition, because we are not prepared for the volume of the wastewater, and we have nobody out there in the federal government and in many states that are looking cumulatively at all of the impacts. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - Male Speaker: So it's about wastewater? Deborah Goldberg: It is wastewater. But [unintelligible], I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\", \"In Ohio. Male Speaker: In Pennsylvania as well. Deborah Goldberg: There's one commercial well that takes shale gas wastewater in all of Pennsylvania and - - Male Speaker: But theres lots of private wells.

[laughter] So, we're trying to make for a lively debate --\", 'I\\'d like to close with two of my favorite quotes from my opponents. In February of this year, Joe Nocera wrote, \"How much methane leaks into the air as a result of fracking?\" Incredibly, nobody knows. In May of this year, Sue Tierney said on NPR, \"Fifty years from now, are we really going to be wondering if we really screwed up because we went on this big gas boom? You really wouldn\\'t want to be F-ing that up,\" and I agree. We don\\'t know, and we really don\\'t want to be messing that up. And that means we need to scale back, slow down, and resist the boom mentality. We have to scale back. We do not have to drill hundreds of thousands of wells just because we can. We don\\'t have to drill near elementary schools, and we can protect our state forests and our parks. We need to slow down. We need to take the time to let the science catch up with the practice and the safeguards catch up with the science, and we need the resources to ensure that the rules we have in place are vigorously enforced. There\\'s no rush. The gas has been there for millions of years. It\\'s not going away. Finally, we have to ignore the advertising slogans on both sides, the demonizing goes on on both sides, filling the airways, and stop living in a fantasy world of endless fossil fuel consumption without consequences. We need to restart the conversation about putting a price on carbon, and we need to develop a real meaningful energy policy, not all of the above. That\\'s no policy at all. Does that make sense to you? [applause] Deborah Goldberg: Do you want to limit the intensive gas development and the breakneck speed of fracking until we answer the open scientific questions and put policies in place to ensure that we are not messing up? Then you should vote for us, because you recognize, as we do, that until we have those safeguards in place and until we have that information, we have nothing but an uncontrolled experiment and the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good.']\n",

Yes, the gas boom is doing more harm than good, but why? What is going on? Simply, the gas companies are rushing forward in the face of too many unknowns and too little control. In essence, these companies are engaged in an uncontrolled experiment, which is resulting in extreme and, in some cases, permanent harm to people, communities, and the environment that cannot be compensated for by any possible benefits. What my partner, Deborah Goldberg, and I will be talking with you about tonight is what those harms are that are being faced across the country because of the natural gas boom: the health risks for individuals, the impacts to the environment, and the costs for local communities. And why, in the face of the unknown, in the face of the harms, gas companies are so intent on rushing forward hoping to figure it out along the way. Well, what exactly is fracking? Deborah and I use the term fracking to refer to the entire cradle-to-grave process of natural gas extraction, from site preparation through transmission to end uses. The process begins with cutting access roads through the existing landscape and stripping a site about the size of five football fields to serve as a Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - multi-well pad. Then the drilling rig will arrive, along with thousands of truckloads of equipment, water, sand, and chemicals that will be used to drill thousands of feet into the ground and miles horizontally. This is followed by the actual fracturing of the well which involves repeatedly, for a month or more, forcing two to eight million gallons of water and hundreds of undisclosed chemicals underground, under pressure, to fracture the rock, allowing the gas to escape. Then something must be done with the large quantity of contaminated wastewater, up to several million gallons per well, that will come back up along with the methane now released from the shale. If not properly handled, the methane may find its way into nearby drinking water wells. It may also be released into the air either intentionally or as a result of leaks. The methane gas that is captured is then processed and forced through gathering lines and into high pressure pipelines that will need to be constructed from numerous wellheads for hundreds and thousands of miles to the place where the gas will be burned, permanently carving up the landscape and communities that lie in between. To give you a clearer idea of how this fracking process is impacting people and communities, imagine that you\\'d go home tonight and find out that your next-door neighbor has signed a lease with a gas drilling company without asking you. What can you expect from this industrial activity going on next door? Even though you didn\\'t choose to lease, you will be exposed to the same risks of contamination to the water you drink and the air you breathe as your neighbor. You will be subject to the same threat of leaks and spills of the fracking wastewater, which contain known carcinogens and radioactive material. Fracking-related spills occur on average once every three days in Colorado. Moreover, the industry has no safe disposal plans for this waste. Much of it is currently injected into underground wells, but this practice has been linked to earthquakes, and there\\'s growing evidence that these wells are leaking. The gas well itself, and associated processing compression in storage tanks, will leak toxic and smog- forming air pollutants. The once pristine air in fracked parts of Wyoming is now worse than the air in Los Angeles because of this. The few studies we do have show increased risks of cancer and respiratory diseases in gas land communities linked to these releases. Like your leasing neighbor, you will be unable to escape noise that can sound -- the constant day and night truck traffic, estimated by New York State at 4,000 truck trips per well. There will be 24/7 noise that can sound like a jet engine, and glaring lights all night Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - long during the drilling and fracturing of the well over the next month or more. You will also potentially have gas pipelines cross your property whether you agree to it or not, and you will be subject to the same increase in your taxes as your drilling neighbor when your town has to repair the road damage caused by the heavy truck traffic that comes with fracking that will tear apart your rural and suburban streets, and when your town has to meet the increased demands for community services from transient drill crews. Proponents argue that the economic benefits outweigh these risks so far. But what are the supposed benefits of this industrial activity almost literally in your backyard, or down the street from your children\\'s pool? The economic benefits for you will be limited. There will be access to cheap natural gas at least for a little while, but it won\\'t last for very long because the amount that can be forced out of the earth is limited and will run out. But even more important, it will not remain cheap, because the industry will be doing everything it can to increase the price of gas, including exporting America\\'s gas to other countries where they can triple -- yes, triple the price -- on the U.S. market today. The drilling will bring jobs, at least while the drill rigs are in town, but not very many and not for long, and these gas industry jobs are some of the most life- threatening in the country. Oil and gas workers are seven times more likely to die on the job than the national average. And fracking can destroy businesses that could sustain local economies into the future after the fracking boom is over, like agriculture, recreation, and tourism. What is clear is that gas companies are not willing to wait. The natural gas boom is moving forward as a large uncontrolled experiment with every individual, family, and community who has not signed a lease being forced to participate without their consent. Whatever transitory benefits fracking may provide is outweighed by all of the harms that it currently brings. But even more important, there are some harms that simply cannot be compensated for. If you can no longer live in your home or continue to work your family farm, if you lose your health, the health of your child, if you lose your life as hundreds of oil and gas workers have. If you lose access to drinkable water or breathable air as individuals in communities across the fracking states have, there is no good that can outweigh such harm. Until we have a much better understanding of the processes and the true risks, until there are mandatory rules in place to control these risks and eliminate the extreme harm, and until the industry actually follows those rules, the only defensible course of Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - action is a cautious one. The only reasonable and fair answer is, \"No, no fracking way.\"', \"I think that the benefits that have just been recited are questionable. For instance, luring the petrochemical industry back into this country, is that really what we want? Or shouldn't we instead be trying to move towards a green economic future for our children, rather than having -- [applause] -- a fossil-fuel based industry come back?\", 'No, I want to actually go to the subject of jobs, because one of the characteristics of the extraction industry is the boom and bust. And what is happening already is that there is -- when the rigs come into town, there are lots of jobs that come up. Truck drivers, they need a lot of truck drivers. They frack the wells and they leave. And then the economy busts. And the record is that those economies are in worse shape than before the extraction industry came into town.', \"Well, I would like to point out that one of the reasons why we're stuck with state regulation is because the oil and gas companies lobbied their way out of at least a half dozen federal environmental laws and requirements, and so now it's with the states. And I'm not particularly impressed by the example of Pennsylvania, which the communities in that state and the environment in that state suffered greatly while the state played regulatory catch-up. And it is still the case that the industry is given a tremendous break. In addition to that, at the state level, across the country, there are not enough regulators to police that. So even if you had half decent regulations, you don't have the staff to put in the field to make sure that those regulations are being complied with.\", \"I don't actually see where the energy security is going to come ultimately if, in fact, the goal of the gas companies, which has been made clear by 15 applications that have been made to the federal government, to export the natural gas to the European and Asian markets, where they can get four to five times as much money for the gas as they can in the domestic market. So once we start exporting that gas, how is that helping our national energy security right now? [applause] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -\", 'Can I just --', \"I just wanted to say that I think that the picking out special places that will be protected from fracking has some serious environmental justice issues around that. So the cities, the people who live in New York City, their drinking water will be protected, the other people in other parts of New York City, their drinking water will not be protected? [applause] I think that's --\", '-- I think thats a policy question.', \"No, I think that the -- I'm not sure actually whether it's 9/11 itself. I think that the using of the national security energy independence argument to support moving forward with natural gas is playing off of the concerns that the nation has had around 9/11, but I think as we talked about, we think that that is not actually very realistic. And so -- [talking simultaneously]\", 'The vast majority of the oil that we use in this country is used for the transportation sector. Natural gas is not going to replace that. Natural gas can be used -- [talking simultaneously] --the power sector, but not for the transportation sector.', \"Where is the wastewater going that's coming out of the well? Male Speaker: Into water disposal wells.\", 'But I would say --', \"-- that the question here is not whether we can do it right at some point in the future, but whether we're doing it right now. Right now -- [applause]\", 'Having heard what our opponents have said here tonight, you might think we should not be concerned about the impacts of fracking. In their view, any problems we have now will be fixed with golden rules, more regulation, and hopes of improved technology. I think of a few reasons to remain concerned. One, there will always be accidents, spills, mechanical failures, and human error. Two, the gas industry has consistently fought enforceable rules and there is insufficient state and federal staff to ensure compliance with what rules do exist. Three, the idea that the industry as a whole will comply with voluntary best practices -- as I think our opponents have acknowledged -- in the face of falling gas prices, is unlikely. Given the continued risk of harm and all of frackings costs weighed against its limited benefits for most, it is beyond dispute that the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good. Simply ask the mothers of children who attend the Red Hawk Elementary School in the Front Range town of Eerie, Colorado. Last fall there were children who stayed home from school with intestinal and breathing problems due to the hundreds of oil drill rigs -- gas drill rigs in the region. Then, the industry insisted on locating gas wells a few hundred yards from the school and a short distance from a school playing field. Parents and children joined together to protest the new well and the town put a temporary moratorium on new permits, but that does not apply to the already permitted elementary school site. So this summer, as drilling takes place, teenage boys will have football practice in the shadow of operating drill rigs. The families of Eerie make it clear, if this uncontrolled experiment, which is the natural gas boom, is allowed to continue, homeowners, farms, schools, and hospitals whose neighbors agree to lease will have no choice. But we have a choice now. The shale gas boom is doing more harm than good and we urge you all to say -- to vote no fracking way. [applause]']\n",

      "[\"Well, I don't think so.  I think violence is why we like it.  And, look, nobody has ever accused me of being consistent about anything.  I also think there's a vast distinction between what we're arguing here, which is college football versus pro players who are being compensated very, very well for what they do and know the risks going in. College players receive nothing beyond a scholarship that is really of questionable value because of the demands placed upon them.  So I think what I've said is very consistent.\", 'Thank you.  You know, it seems to me that given that this debate is taking place at a university that is one of the greatest and most innovative in the country that doesn\\'t have football, I think this debate ends right now.  Our nation is at a cornerstone.  There\\'s no doubt about it.  We are questioning everything, tax rate, rich versus poor, who are we? What are we?  In a very intense the most competitive global economy we have ever faced. And one of the things that we are looking at and must look at which makes this debate pertinent is the role of the university.  It is pivotal.  Questions over course offerings, allocation of resources in a very difficult era as governors are slashing to the bone, dwindling money, rising tuition.  And yet, a recent book by two sociologists, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa says that basically undergraduates embrace college life, and it is shaped and oriented to nonacademic endeavors.  The amount of study time has gone -- and this was by two labor economists. Study time in colleges has gone from over 40 hours in the 1960s to 20 hours in the 1980s to currently 13 hours of study time.  And I believe that at the top of what has become the university distraction, the distracted university is football, is football. It sucks all the air out of the room.  The amount of money that coaches make is insulting.  It is insulting when a coach is making five to 10 to 15 times more than a college president. What does it say?  What does it say about the priorities of a university?  It says that the head coach runs the school.  And make no mistake.  That was the tragedy of Joe Paterno. He did run Penn State.  He did run Penn State.  And I know he ran Penn State because when Graham Spanier went to his house in 2004 and said, \"Joe, it\\'s time to retire,\" he threw him out.  They never spoke for 10 years.  Joe ran that school. And when it was his chance to do what was the morally right thing to do, which was to go to the police, the culture of omerta that surrounds football, he did nothing except harbor a suspected child molester.  This is what we\\'re dealing with in football.  A few Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - facts in what they call the football bowl subdivision, the big 125 schools.  Spending per student in those schools, $13,471.  Spending per athlete, $91,053.  6.8 times as much for a student athlete.  In the famed SEC, 11.6 times as much.  It\\'s become a facility arms and 2005. 20 percent of current spending that by the way is not included in a lot of the revenue statements you\\'ll see in NCAA reports.  And that\\'s not from me, that\\'s from Andrew Zimbalist who is considered the leading sports economic professor in the country from Smith College. 20 percent of current spending is on facility expansion, which is wonderful except what happens if these teams stop winning?  People will not go.  They will not go.  From USA Today June 16, 2011, more than $470 million, more than $470 million, most of it in student fees by students who do not play sports went into subsidized college athletic programs, in particular in football.  And this is in the era, a national trend of declining state support, tuition increases and salary freezes.  How many football programs have cut their budgets?  A few did in 2010, but it\\'s back up.  It is back up.  It is back up. Salaries of coaches, I mentioned it, average salary for a football coach, $1.47 million. That\\'s up 55 percent in six seasons.  A professor, 1986 to 2007, his salary went up 30 percent.  The college president, 100 percent.  The football coach, 500 percent.  500 percent.  And I defy both of you to tell me why Urban Meyer deserves, of Ohio State, $24 million over six seasons.  I defy you to tell me that.  I defy you to tell me why Mack Brown deserves $5.192 million, not to mention the $850,000 bonus he will get.  And I can go down the ride.  Not to mention David Cutcliffe at Duke, which has a terrible football program, but we\\'re seeing $1.762 million. And there are all these myths, all of these myths, character, character from CBS/SI poll in 2011, 7 percent of college football players, 7 percent have criminal records, 7 percent. 2,837 players, they studied the top 25 programs, at the top of the list, Pitt, Pitt, 22 players on the team in 2010 have been charged with a crime.  Myth, increased alumni giving, myth, 2005, Robert Frank of the Johnson School of Management at Cornell, existing empirical literature supports that success of big time athletics has little if any systematic effect on the quality of incoming freshmen in institutions able to attract. That\\'s the -- one of the things about football is it attracts better studentsit does not.  It attracts more applications but the students are of low caliber.  Myth, football gives back.

There was no China in the 1960s that was competing.  There was no India.  There was no South Korea.  And, call me nave, I really do think that these universities have to be almost exclusively about education.  And one other thing, you asked about getting rid of sports?  I'll tell you why it wouldn't be a bad idea, because then, that's actually the best argument for keeping football, you keep football, you keep basketball, you get rid of all the other sports that they pay for so that money at least goes into the general fund so the average student is getting something out of it.\", \"But on a very, very minor, minor scale. Male Speaker: Yes, so it's Division 3. Male Speaker: But they wear a helmet and hit each other. [talking simultaneously] Male Speaker: And, Mr. Whitlock, I do work on Wall Street as well, so actually I think I had some success in my career after graduating from the University of Chicago. I can tell you this much, the University of Chicago athletes in general, not just football but athletes overall, have a higher GPA when I graduated in 2000 than the overall student body. So your question, the argument of athletics in education, there is a correlation of your education -- [talking simultaneously] Male Speaker: So the question is this, now, it is also true that Division 1 programs without football, no one makes money.  Football programs pay for all the other sports.  So once you ban football, how do you pay for women's swimming, how do you pay for every other sport there is because there is a correlation between athletics and academics. Buzz Bissinger: Intelligence Squared U.S. - 60 - How do you pay for women's swimming?  The way you pay for a lot of things. Male Speaker: Taxes? Buzz Bissinger: No, you get a rich benefactor, and there are plenty out there who will pay for the program because frankly that's what's happening now.  The next phase of college football will be Boone Pickens.  Why is Oklahoma State so good?  Because he's given $300 million to the football program.  The University of Oregon, it came out of nowhere to be a football power.  Why?  Because of the hundreds of millions given by Phil Knight. If you want to have women's swimming, you have a benefactor pay for it. And you know as well as I do that Chicago is in a very, very different place than the 125 BCS schools.  There is no question that places like Chicago and Harvard and Wesleyan where kids don't think that they're going to be pro football players, the most formidable person I have ever met is an athlete because they don't quit.  But you know what the problem with athletes are?  You know where they do the best?  Wall Street.  And you know why Wall Street is so screwed up?  Its because athletes --\", '-- it\\'s true, athletes don\\'t know when to quit.  They\\'re only about winning. [applause] Female Speaker: One of the greatest American philosophers, John Dewey, wrote a book called, \"Democracy in Education,\" and he discusses the importance of sport in play in the -- both K through 12 education as well as the system of American higher education. And I\\'m wondering what the side for banning college football would think John Dewey would think of the idea of taking sport in play out of the curriculum of American higher education when it actually is a really important part of the higher education of an individual, whether it\\'s intramural sports or -- I don\\'t know what the level of college sports is, but --', 'And just to clarify, I mean, you could have -- people might not like it -- you could have wonderful club sports that could be very, very competitive.  I mean, you can have a schedule.  The amount of travel the teams do is ridiculous.  You can have a schedule where youre competing against regional teams.  I think John Dewey was talking about the development of the whole individual.  The fact is, theres no phys-ed anymore in schools. Everything is about and by and for the athlete.  And what happens is you create the athletic culture.', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 62 - No, because, I mean, I --', 'You know, I think the model of Division 2 and Division 3 is better.  I think if you read William Bowens book, I think its called Game of Play, its a fantastic book based on data that he got from the Ivy League and from Duke.  I mean, the one thing he did point out, and the little three, he said, Its a total fallacy to think that the Ivy League does not recruit and does not play games with scholarships and that Williams actually gives more athletic preference to athletes than the University of Michigan.  I think all these programs are loss leaders and, you know, look --', 'Im advocating -- heres what Im --', 'No, but Im advocating that there are other ways to do it.  Whether its a minor league season, whether its an NFL developmental system, why not the European model? The European model.  They dont use their colleges and universities to create soccer players.  They have sports academies, they have schools.  Theyve plucked players as young as six because they say, All right, you want to be a soccer player, youre showing talent, and they go to school there.  And the other thing they do that is smart and beneficial is if youre not going to make it, youre weeded out early so you learn --', '-- at an early age --', 'All right, sorry.', 'No, I think we ban college football and then you have a developmental system for those who are --', '-- at the higher echelons of competition.  And for the rest of the schools --', 'Yeah, you --', 'I mean, you license it out.', 'You license it out.', 'Yeah, that [inaudible] --', 'Look, there\\'s no question, this is a radical solution. But I think it is called for in what are radical times.  I am surprised that Tim and Jason seem not to be affected at all about our lagging academic performance, that we\\'re now 14th in the world in math and reading and science when we used to be first, that we\\'re 16th in educational attainment, meaning that other countries are catching up and catching up rapidly and exceeding us when we used to be first.  We simply do not have time to waste. Universities were set up for a primary academic purpose.  They were not set up as sports factories disguised as universities.  And I understand the graduation rate is 69 percent.  I think it\\'s ginned up. I think a lot of players, and I think even Tim would -- he\\'ll admit this to me privately afterwards -- a lot of players are pushed through and passed through with no demands placed upon him.  And I know the impact.  I did write a book called \"Friday Night Lights\" in which the cornerstone character was a black running back named Boobie Miles.  Now, this was high school.  And I saw what happened as many college players are when you are treated as a football animal, when you pass -- because the word on the street is -- with the professors is, \"You better pass that kid or there\\'s going to be trouble.\"  Boobie Miles got no education.  He was a football animal.  He was considered dysfunctional, basically an idiot, which he was not.  And I\\'ll tell you, with no education, his life has been nothing, nothing but a horrendous hell and a lot of broken dreams that football propagates more than any other sport.']\n",
      "[\"Well, the difference in Canada is that we don't care about football. [laughter]\", 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 6 - Thank you.  I should say before we start that I haven\\'t debated since college and that was many years ago.  And that was in Canada, and in Canada a debate isn\\'t really a debate, it\\'s simply an alternate mechanism of reaching consensus. [laughter] So this is all very new and exciting for me.  I want to make one thing clear before we start and that is that this is not a debate about banning football nor is it a debate about whether there are merits to playing football. You will hear I\\'m quite sure from Mr. Green and Mr. Whitlock that all kinds of wonderful things happen when you play football, you learn camaraderie and discipline and teamwork. All of those things are true, and neither Buzz nor I are going to dispute any of them.  This debate is about a very specific question.  Right now in colleges across the country schools field football teams for the purpose of offering recreation to the players and offering entertainment to fans and students and alumni.  And the question is, is that appropriate. Buzz is going to say, \"That\\'s not appropriate because the players are exploited,\" and I\\'m going to say that, \"It\\'s not appropriate because schools should not be in the business of encouraging young men to hit themselves over the head.\"  Let\\'s talk a little bit about hitting over the head.  Start with a very simple -- the simple physics of football. The human brain is a mass of soft tissue that is suspended within a hard skull, right? Every time you get hit, that soft tissue rattles around inside your skull.  And the effect of that rattling around is to stretch and sometimes tear the connections between your nerve cells. In the course of everyday life, that almost never happens.  In the course of playing football, that happens all the time.  It is not unusual in the course of a game for a player to sustain hits to the head of between 40 and 100 Gs.  To put that in perspective, if you were to get in your car and not put on your seatbelt and drive at 25 miles an hour into a brick wall so that your forehead struck the dashboard of the car, that would be a hit of 100 Gs, right?  If you reversed your car and went and did it over and over again so that you hit the brick wall 30 to 40 times at speeds between 20 and 25 miles an hour, that would be the equivalent of a football game.  If you reversed your car and over the course of the next three months drove it at 25 miles an hour into a brick wall 1,000 times, that would be the equivalent of a college football season. Now, you\\'re going to hear from Mr. Whitlock and Mr. Green, they\\'re going to try and tell you that there are ways around this fact, that if we have better rules or better Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - treatment of concussions or better helmets, the effect of that kind of injury can be minimized.  That is a fantasy.  There are ways to cut down on the number of concussions, but concussions are only a small part of the problem.  The real issue is all of those thousands of tiny hits.  There isn\\'t a helmet in the world that can be designed that can take the sting out of those hits, and there is no way to play this game of football and remove those hits without turning tackle football into touch football, and the last I checked this was not a debate about whether we should ban touch football on college campuses.  I once watched a football practice at the University of North Carolina where the players were playing without pads; they were just doing a simple scrimmage. In the course of 20 minutes, one of their running backs sustained hits to the head of 79, 60, and 30 Gs.  In 15 minutes, he had the equivalent of three car accidents.  Now, what\\'s the effect of all of that neurological trauma?  Well, we know.  It\\'s a condition called, \"CTE,\" which brings about premature death and the equivalent of Alzheimer\\'s in people who are as young as 40 years old.  I\\'ve seen pictures of the brain scans of people with CTE and it looks like someone drove a truck across their brain.  Now, we don\\'t know how many ex-football players have this condition because you can\\'t diagnose it until they die, until you do an autopsy of your brain, but there are people who estimate there are as many as 20 percent of football players who have this condition.  And we also know that there are players as young as 18 years old who have been diagnosed with CTE.  Its a problem that begins in high school and is made worse during college. Now, I have no problem whatsoever with grown men in full possession of the facts and risks of the game choosing to participate in a potentially lethal profession, right?  I have no problem with people who smoke cigarettes, I have no problem with people who do deep sea diving, I have no problem with people who want to drive their motorcycle without a helmet on.  If you want to play Russian roulette with your brain, fine.  But college is a very, very different matter.  Every single college in this country, rich or poor, big or small, is supported by the taxpayer dollars of the people in this room.  They are subsidized by us, they are given immunity from taxes, they are supported by laws of Congress, by acts of local legislatures.  They are in every way funded by the people in this room.  And the reason for that special relationship between us and the world of higher education is that they are charged with a sacred trust, and that is to prepare the minds of young men and women to lead lives -- the minds of young -- to lead productive lives as full citizens of the United States. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - And nowhere, nowhere, in that social contract does it say that its okay to promote and encourage young men to hit themselves over and over again in the head in the name of entertainment.  Thank you. [applause]', 'Wait.  Thats your defense, that hedge fund managers are just as bad?  At this point cant we declare the debate over?', \"Well, first of all, that's small comfort if you get a degree in a short term and a massive brain injury in the long term. [laughter] But secondly --\", \"The other thing that I -- almost everything that our two opponents said, I agree with if they simply substituted in another sport for football, right?  The issue is not that football does all kinds of wonderful things.  Of course it does.  Do football players graduate?  Of course they do.  Do they learn all kinds of wonderful character things?  Absolutely.  But Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - do we have to bash them over the head in order to communicate those virtues?  Why can't they row? Why can't they kick a soccer ball?

I get all misty eyed thinking about it.', 'I -- you know, the thing that I always come back to that has mystified me throughout this whole debate is what on earth is so special about football?  I mean, if 50 years ago or 75 years ago the major colleges had all decided that they would compete at Monopoly -- [laughter] -- and that somehow Monopoly had gotten lodged in the imagination of the American scholar Monopoly player.  And that they started to give out scholarships for Monopoly players and then the Monopoly coaches earned millions of dollars and they built large stadia, which 1,000 people would come to watch the Monopoly players compete against each other. And then suddenly it was observed that Monopoly had gotten out of control and we said, Maybe its time for us to turn our back on Monopoly.  I can imagine the two of you just standing up there and saying, No.  Theres something magical about this game.', 'My point is there is nothing -- its just a game.  Replace it with another game.', 'Yeah.', 'My point is --', 'My point is its probably real but you could get it with something else.  Monopoly.  Lets try it. [laughter]', \"Wait.  Now I'm really confused.  I've just been listening to you for the last half hour going on about freedom and dumbing.  And all of a sudden now you're not for freedom any more.\", \"Except when you're not.\", \"Two weeks ago at the University of Florida, they shut down their computer science department, and they added $2 million a year to their athletic budget, bringing their -- the football program share of that budget to $78 million.  Now, they didn't think of the banning of computer science at the University of Florida as setting a dangerous precedent.\", \"So if that's the case, I'm not so worried about the football --\", \"We're not talking about taking sports out of the curriculum.  We're talking about banning semi professional -- or -- Buzz might have a slightly different interpretation of this than me -- but I think that if you look at schools like for example MIT, which has one of the highest participation rates in intramural sports in the country, their level of play is far higher than everybody else's, perhaps as a consequence of the fact that theyve turned their backs on big time college sports. So I think you could -- if we focused on precisely what John Dewey was interested in doing, which is bringing sports down to the level of the average -- the ordinary student, then that would be more easily achieved if we got away from this preoccupation with these enormously costly and dangerous spectacles.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 67 - The most surprising thing about this debate to me at the send that we only mentioned the name Junior Seau twice.  And to my mind, Junior Seau's shadow is cast over this whole evening.  Last week he shot himself in the chest. And he played four years at the University of Southern California, over which I'm guessing he was hit in the head about 4,000 times.  He's not the first.  Before Junior Seau, there was Dave Duerson, played four years at the University of Notre Dame, during which time he was probably hit in the head around 4,000 times.  He wasn't the first, either.  Before him, there was Andre Waters.  Shot himself in the head.  Played four years at Cheyney University over which time he was probably hit in the time at least 4,000 times.  I could go on and on and on right down to the captain of the Penn football team who hung himself in his room a couple years ago.  Someone did an autopsy on his brain.  What did they find?  They found evidence of long-term neurological damage that was the result of being hit in the head too many times.  Now, I have sat, and I have listened to some -- some of the things that the other side has said have been extraordinarily eloquent.  I think some of the things that both Tim and Jason said about what this game can do are absolutely true.  It is, in many ways, a beautiful game. It's a game that teaches all kinds of powerful and fundamental lessons.  It's a game that's a central part of our culture.  But at a certain time, I think this debate comes down to one thing, and that is you have to look at the collateral damage this game has left in its wake. And you have to ask the question, is it time to say, enough?\"]\n",

      "['The internet changed more than I did.', 'Good evening, everyone.  I find myself arguing that the Internet is closing our minds with a bit of regret.  This isn\\'t the place that I would want to be, and actually as of a few years ago I would have been arguing the other side, but I\\'ve come to believe that the -- well, the Internet is incredibly good at getting groups of likeminded people to get together, think together, work together. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - But it\\'s actually quite bad at bridging between groups of different people, and that the view that the Internet is exposing us to all sorts of new ways of thinking and new ideas is kind of a dated view, that the Internet\\'s changing, and that there are a few big companies that would like us to hold onto that idea that the Internet is still this kind of open place.  So the core of my argument is this, attention is the most valuable commodity out there right now.  If you command attention, then you can direct it towards products or services and you can make a lot of money, and that\\'s why all of the big companies on the Internet are trying to figure out what the best strategy is for gathering as much of it as possible.  And most of them are focused on the same strategy which is gathering as much data about us as they can and then using that data to give us what they think, what they predict, based on their -- this data and their algorithms, we\\'re going to be interested in. Relevance is the big watchword here.  So, you know, if you talk to these companies, if you look at what they\\'re saying, it\\'s very clear that this is a big part of the business plan. Eric Schmidt says, \"Very soon it will be nearly impossible to see something that has not in some way been tailored to you.\"  Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, says, \"Within the next few years, it\\'ll be anachronistic to visit a website that hasn\\'t been customized to your personal interests in some way.\"  And Facebook is becoming this growing source of how people get their news and how people get their information.  So why are they doing this?  Well, I think Evgeny actually put it really well.  Why does Facebook employ filters? The more they know about us, the more they can make in advertising revenues.  And the thing is that these companies aren\\'t blind to the psychology of all this. They\\'ve read all of the studies that show that when you present people with information that confirms what they already believed was true, you can actually see these little bursts of pleasure happening in people\\'s brains. And conversely, when people are presented with information that challenges what they believed, they get cranky.  That\\'s just the way we\\'re wired.  And so if you\\'re a company that\\'s trying to meet stockholder demands and you have this power to present people with information that tends to validate them, why wouldn\\'t you?  As a result of this kind of personalization and self selection, we\\'re more likely to see things we agree with and less likely to see things we disagree with.  Now, to be clear, I\\'m not arguing that all personalization is bad.  Personalization certainly can have benefits.  I\\'m a Netflix user. But the question is, what are the driving motives behind the kind of personalization that most people use, and what are the effects of that personalization?  And I\\'ll argue that because of the motives of these companies, those filters that they\\'re building are going to tend to surround us with information that\\'s agreeable to us and not with information that\\'s uncomfortable. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - So a few examples of what this looks like in practice, it looks like one person googling Egypt and seeing lots of information about the Arab Spring and another person googling Egypt at the same time and seeing nothing about the Arab Spring.  This actually happened, I\\'ve got the screenshots on my website.  And, you know, I could run through a number of other anecdotes, but actually there\\'s been a study -- the only peer reviewed study I\\'m aware of on the Google search results and the effects of personalization there -- that shows that 60 percent of the search results on a given front page are usually personalized.  Either they\\'re in a different order or they\\'re actually, you know, totally different results based on who Google thinks you are and what it thinks you\\'ll be interested in.  So what I think we have to begin to do is to tease apart what the Internet actually does from what we wish it would do or what it possibly could do.  And in particular we have to tease apart what\\'s possible to access versus what people do access.  For example, now that the -- it\\'s easy now to access the front page of Le Monde or Die Zeit, as it is, in fact to access the New York Times. So you would think, given this vast increase in accessibility of foreign policy, information, of whats going on in other countries, that people would know more about whats going on there.  In fact thats not true.  According to a Pew study from 2007, people actually were more informed on foreign policy matters before the internet than in 2007.  So when Jacob says you can find more sources than ever, its kind of beside the point.  Whats relevant is that people come into daily contact more frequently, is whether people come into daily contact with more different sources and more particular, different ideological ones.  I agree here again with Evgeny who says the regular folk dont read sites like Global Voices, an aggregator of the most interesting blog posts from all over the world.  Instead they are more likely to use the internet to rediscover their own culture and dare we say it, their own national bigotry.  So to summarize, big companies are rapidly working to personalize your version of the web. They want to show you what they think youre going to be interested in.  And this isn\\'t passive. This isnt me turning on Fox News or me turning on -- or picking up a copy of the Nation. This is embedded in an increasing number of websites.  Yahoo News in 2007, was a gateway for 80 million people that looked the same.  But now, Yahoo runs 13 million different variations of Yahoo News front page every day.  And theyre different for each person.  Its hard to even see.  We dont know how tailored our view of the web is because you have to sit down next to someone else and look at the differences.  So the object of this personalization is to get us to click more.  Its to get us to like more. And importantly, its to get us to click on ads.  And theres little benefit in that world to presenting us with information that makes us uncomfortable, that challenges our views, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - or that makes us think differently.  I dont think that this has caused the extreme political polarization that were seeing right now.  But I think it cant help but exacerbate it. Google says that its trying to provide relevance.  But what is the most relevant search result when youre a 9/11 conspiracy theorist googling 9/11?  Is it the conspiracy links that Googles algorithm would tend to promote or is it the Popular Mechanics article that would debunk that stuff?  I asked Google this question and they didnt really have a clear answer. So its with regret that I think the Internet is not living up to its potential. The way that most people actually use the thing isnt to broaden their political perspectives.  In fact the path that we generally travel on online will tend to mirror our political views. Thank you. [applause]', \"Let's talk a little bit about the studies about --\", \"-- because I think it's worth digging into this a little bit.  There is one -- first off, the reason that it's so hard to study this stuff is because the easiest way to study it is to get inside the black box of these companies.  And these companies don't have any interest in letting people go in and prove that these companies are doing bad things.  But it's very hard to look at from the outside, which is why there's just not many studies that haven't been, as Jacob said, you know, funded by Facebook, funded by Microsoft, funded by the companies themselves. The one clear study on Google personalization that has been peer reviewed is a study by a guy named Martin Feuz.  And it's pretty clear.  The methodology is good.  He looked at how a search history affects the personalization you get.  And it's very clear, again, 60 percent of the search results on the first page are different for most -- for people who have a long web history in Google.  But actually, the study that's the most interesting here is the Gentzkow study that Jacob was referring to.  This is a study that was sort of initially described as a study that showed that people are linking to each other and that the internet isn't as polarizing as we thought.  And the interesting thing is that if you dig into that study, it actually arguably shows the exact opposite.  What they did was they created an isolation index for each different kind of medium.  And so the isolation index for cable news that that study used was about 3.3.  On the internet, the internet had a 7 -- an isolation index of 7. And so it's twice as polarizing as polarized as cable news.  Now, what's more interesting is that this was -- the study was done before the personalized internet.  So the main thing that that study was looking at was the fact that a lot of people, their online serving Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - patterns lead them to Yahoo! and then from Yahoo! out to a whole bunch of ideologically diverse links. But Yahoo!'s changed since 2007, since that study was written.  And so now, Yahoo! looks at your history on what links you've clicked at in the past and sends different people out in different directions.\", 'One more [unintelligible], though.', \"Which is that the other thing that's changed since that study was done is the rise of social media as one of the primary ways that people get information.  And they did this isolation index calculation on people's sets of friends as well.  So cable news is 3.3. The internet in 2007 in the Yahoo! era was 7.  And people's groups of friends was 30. Now, that 30 has become embedded in every experience that we have on the internet now.  So you know, I think actually if you look into the studies that have been done --\", \"-- it's quite clear --\", 'But you cited it.  I mean, this is the study that you were citing.', 'What do you think of the Feuz study?  Because we Tweeted about this.', \"Well, you don't hear me arguing that all personalization is bad or all filtering is bad. That's kind of a nonsensical argument.  As everyone has said, filtering has been around as long as there's information to filter.  But the question is, what are the filters -- what are the lenses through which we're looking at the world now doing for most people who are looking at the world through those lenses? And I think we're talking a lot here about Twitter, but it's important to remember that Twitter -- actually it's hard to remember in a group of New Yorkers -- Twitter is a fringe phenomenon on the Internet relative to Google or Facebook.  Twitter has a tiny, tiny user base compared to these other -- sorry?\", \"Well, the -- but the actual -- the actual user -- you know, the active users, if you look at active users on Twitter, it's actually much smaller, it's about 25 million people, which is a lot of people, but not compared to Facebook, not compared to Google.  And so we have to look at sort of how most people are using this stuff.\", 'I\\'m not suggesting that we replace the old media paternalism with new paternalism.  I\\'m suggesting that, if we built these tools toward the purpose of helping people get good information, including a diversity of perspective, we could do that in a way that would draw on the Internet strength.  So I\\'ll give you one example, Facebook, the main way that you propagate information across Facebook is with the Like button.  The Like button has a very particular valence.  It\\'s easy to click Like on, \"I baked a cake,\" it\\'s hard to click Like on, \"Massacre in Darfur continues for 11th year.\"  And so certain kinds of information propagate very readily. Other kinds of information don\\'t propagate at all.  Now, without instituting any kind of objective paternalism, this is more important than that, you could put an Important button on Facebook that\\'ll allow people to elevate the topics that they believed were important as well as the topics that they think are fun and interesting and that they\\'d like their friends to see.

And the host decided to make this big spectacle of having people Google Barack Obama and call-in and read their search results.  It was a really boring radio hour.  And the first person called in, the second person called in and they interviewed everybody and had people kind of do a read-off where theyre both reading it off at the same time and it was exactly the same.  And I was thinking, this is the worse book promotion Ive ever done.  And then a third guy called in, and he said you know its the damndest thing, when I Google Barack Obama, the first thing that comes up is this link to this site about how hes not a natural citizen.  And the second link is also a link to a website about how he doesnt have a birth certificate.', \"Oh, I was wondering about that.

But he didnt even know that that was the view that he was getting.  He had no idea how tilted that view was.  And thats sort of the challenge.  I just want to address one other point, which is that there seems to be this question about whether this is happening.  And its really kind of funny to me, because if you talk to these companies and if you listen to what theyre saying, all of these companies are very clear that personalization is a big part of what theyre doing and what they're --\", 'Right, and the question is, can you trust them?

And one of the fascinating things about this book is that you have two things going on at the same time. On the one hand, there is a broader set of types of communities than there was 30 years ago, right?  That\\'s undoubtedly true.  On the other hand, for each individual person in that system, their neighborhood is more like people like them than it ever was in the past.  And so you have local homogeneity and heterogeneity at the top level.  And I think when people are trying to make the opposite argument, they point to, hey, look at the internet, there\\'s all this different stuff out there.  It\\'s so heterogeneous. Everybody\\'s talking.  But actually, the question is, what are people\\'s local neighborhoods like?  And to the extent that we\\'re now bringing those local neighborhoods with us online, what effect does that have in, you know, amplifying the homogeneity that increasingly surrounds us even when we\\'re off line.', 'I just want to -- [talking simultaneously]', \"When I was at Move On, we tried a number of times to do these kinds of cross partisan conversations and have people sit down in a room together and talk.

And I can't help but wonder as Evgeny has, as have many of us, if the way that the Internet is structured isn't amplifying that and helping people who believe, you know, pretty in my opinion, you Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 - know, misinformation, like the Obama birth certificate stuff or that climate change is not something that's partly caused by people, is it amplified by that.\", 'I think, just to take a step for the resolution.', 'I dont think anyone up here thinks that the primary thing driving American-- the very partisan spirit of American discourse is the internet.

Is the way that people are using the internet helping or hurting in this? And I think, its hard to argue, most peoples social networks are homogenous, thats just true.  Most people do have social networks that are largely made up of people like them. Now there are the outliers for sure.

That's like the experience that a lot of us have a lot of the time, but the question is whether the daily routines that we move through online will tend to bring us into contact more with people who make us feel that way or more with people who actually validate who we feel.  And as social networking becomes a bigger phenomenon, and I think in specific Facebook, lets separate Facebook from Twitter, it's easier than ever to surround yourself with people who mostly agree with you, that's who your friends are. Now, just to address Twitter in particular, like I agree with these guys that Twitter is like a pretty good medium for filtering the Internet and I use it to -- I follow Karl Rove on Twitter and I get Karl Rove's tweets and it's great.

They said, \"We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.  We believe that the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that its crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.\" Now, the two researchers were Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and this was just months before they launched Google as a for-profit entity.  I think that version of them was right.  I think that the companies that increasingly control where and how we put information online have mixed motives.  And the motives that they use in creating these filters may not be, and in fact arent in our best interests.  Theyre more likely to surround us with voices that tell us that were great and were right and were good enough and strong enough.  And theyre less likely to confront us with the places where were wrong.  Whats been interesting for me since writing the book is that Ive actually Intelligence Squared U.S. - 53 - been invited to come talk with engineers at all of these companies, Amazon, Apple, Google, YouTube, and Facebook.  Ive had conversations with people in each of those places.  And its sort of funny for me to hear people try to suggest that it isnt a big part of what these companies are trying to do.  The engineers know that it is. They wrestle with it every day.  They wrestle with the mixed motives, with these questions of how they should be building these platforms.  And they know as one Netflix vice president told me, that they can easily end up trapping people in these bubbles where they tend to believe the same thing.  So if you believe that the companies whose algorithms decide what we pay attention to, will tend to expose us to a broad diverse set of sources, you should vote with them.  But if you agree with me that we should scrutinize that, and that these commercial interests will tend to use that power to placate people rather than exposing them to more broad senses of view, then you should vote that the internet has in fact, unfortunately, been closing our minds.']\n",
      "[\"Well, I never thought Google was evil, but I did think that was an impossible standard for any company to hold, so it was actually not that hard to win.  I think the really interesting question is, does Google think I'm evil. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - [laughter]\", 'Thank you. [applause] So the internet has so narrowed my mind that I didn\\'t hear a word Jacob said. [laughter] So in these brief comments, I will explain what Eli and I mean by the internet as invoked in the resolution and what we mean by politics.  And I\\'m going to convince you to support the resolution.  First, try to remember 1999, the days of AOL, the days of Prodigy, the apex of our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity.  In 1999, Thomas Friedman wrote these words:  \"the internet is going to be like a huge vise.  It\\'s going to keep tightening and tightening that system --meaning the system of globalization -- \"around everyone in ways that will only make the world smaller, smaller and faster and faster.\" Well, Thomas Friedman could not have been more wrong.  He\\'s been exactly that wrong many times, but never more wrong. [laughter] Now, in 2012, it\\'s clear that there is no such thing as \"The Internet, capital T, capital I as Friedman and others so often described in the 1990s.  There is no equalizing force, great democratizing force, there is no global network of networks that unites us all and gives us all equal voice to interact with each other across borders and across classes, for that matter.  In fact, the alleged network of networks is, in 2012, balkanized, nationalized, compromised, anesthetized, supervised, circumcised and hypnotized.  It\\'s far from global, and it\\'s getting less so every day.  The online experience of a person sitting in Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - Turkey is so different from the online experience of someone sitting in India and so different from the online experience of someone sitting in Iran or someone sitting in China. And all of those are even more different from the experiences of people in Brazil, in Russia or the United States.  And we\\'re talking about more than censorship, although, in many of those countries, online censorship is a serious and crippling issue.  We\\'re also talking about platforms, the platforms that people use, the platforms that governments will let people use. The rise of kill switches is something we have to take into account as well.  Kill switches that we saw a year ago in Egypt to wipe out internet communication in an instant, we\\'ve seen experiments in kill switches in China in early 2012, and we\\'ve seen people like Senator Lieberman even propose them in the United States.  Internet technologies amplify so much of what we already are and what we already want.  And the fact is, we\\'re pretty provincial animals.  So add the internet to it, we just double down. We get more provincial.  Platforms matter, defaults matter, and policies matter.  So here in 2012, or now in 2012, we are not all holding virtual hands with our Facebook friends across the globe singing, \"We are the world.\"  There is no coordinated global movement for justice. There\\'s no sophisticated online debate about our collective human state or even our basic human needs.  The dominant powers governing our digital experiences, the state, for instance, in China, or corporations in Brazil or the United States are not interested in such matters.  They are not interested in us being political.  Sometimes these powers actively restrict us, like in China.  More often than not, these powers seduce us into shallow consumption, consumptive behaviors like shopping or giggling at cats or clicking on cows. Not that there\\'s anything wrong with clicking on virtual cows, but it ain\\'t political. Our minds are closing because our attentions are distracted, fractured and segregated into niches and nations.  But all hope is not lost.  There is nothing about the nature of the internet that prevents us from being political, richly political.  Many of us actually are, I would suspect that most of us in the audience have done a pretty good job of avoiding these traps. We\\'re pretty elite.  We\\'re pretty aware.  And we\\'re pretty connected.  And we route around a lot of these problems.  We\\'re also hungry for information.  If you weren\\'t hungry, you wouldn\\'t be here.  So many of us, despite what Facebook does with thoughts, despite what the Iranian government does in Iran, have managed to be richly political.  But we do know that the internet by itself does not topple dictators, does not undermine newspapers.  It\\'s just not that simple.  If we Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - recognized the biases inherent in many of the platforms of our media systems, we can correct, we can adjust, we can invest, we can invent, we can resist, persist, and thrive. We could build platforms that enhance Republican deliberation and extend cosmopolitan perspectives.  We just haven\\'t done that yet.  We\\'ve been really busy clicking on cows.  But all that takes work.  It takes real human work in addition to invention and imagination, real human effort.  But the first step to recognizing that -- I\\'m sorry -- the first step to realizing that is to recognize what\\'s happening.  When it comes to politics, the Internet, most importantly how we experience the Internet is closing our minds one cow click at a time. Please vote for the motion.  Thanks.', \"I merely meant that Jacob's test, whether it works for you, wasn't a good enough test, largely because you are just you, and you are not we.  You are not a greater sample, right?

I think we should be in the business of building new platforms, new tools, new ways of relating to each other.  And having these conversations, I think everybody should read books about the subject, which is a pretty good way.  And then adjust your own behavior and have those ideas echo through your social networks, that perhaps its a good idea to break out of the filter bubble.\", 'So, doing social science online is really hard because almost nothing is replicable.  Right so almost any, even if you did a broader study than that, even if Eli did a broader study than that, the third person to do that study would not come up with the same results. For the simple reason that both Facebook and Google are constantly changing their algorithms, constantly tweaking their algorithms for reasons we cant possibly understand and are not allowed to understand.  Its also important to remember that there are so many variables in what you get.  There are some searches that are more personalized than other searches.  Again, for reasons that Google understands and we are not allowed to understand.  There are some ways that you can generate different searches because there are certain keywords that matter more in certain geographic locations than others.  So a search for S-O-X in Boston or Chicago will yield a particularly strong result and personalized in those areas where as S-O-X searched somewhere else in the world might yield gibberish because it doesnt mean anything.

And the notion that we are so addicted to something now we can measure, the click, the instant attention, the instant affirmation, just reinforces that, so it is a phenomenon that\\'s actually moved from the blogosphere, and that\\'s why we\\'ve seen so many people who got famous being bloggers now are appearing on CNN at 2 PM, now appearing on Fox at 7 PM.

The important thing is that we let a few things fail, and we try to learn from our mistakes.  But we do so openly. We do so deliberately.  And we don't sign away so many important things to a black box.\", \"I don't disagree.  I was just talking about transparency.\", 'We actually know that there -- it\\'s really hard to watch YouTube in China right now.  And for a while, it wasn\\'t so hard.

During the Tibetan uprising three years ago, YouTube basically went dark.  During the Olympics, it went dark.  And it\\'s been intermittent since.  And nobody has banged on the doors of the Chinese government saying, \"I want my YouTube.\"  They\\'re busy with their own video services. They\\'re busy with their own business.  They\\'re busy clicking on their own issues, right? So it doesn\\'t necessarily follow in that example.  The other thing to remember, when talking about the Arab Spring, going to a different part of the world, is that only 30 percent of the Egyptian population was online at the time.  And then 11 days into the protest, zero percent were. SMS was a much more important media form for doing anything.  And Al Jazeera was probably the most important media forum for informing people.  So what happened in North Africa had very little to do with cats, cute or otherwise.', \"Evgeny has just done a great job to convince me that there is no virtue in the arguments made by people who are not me and not Eli and not made during this debate.  We have not advocated a government takeover of anything.  We have not advocated any Cass Sunstein-type intervention.  We merely want you to be aware of the problem and correct for it.  Jacob said, what if we had a world without the web?  What if we had the world without the web? We might get there.  Let me tell you why, because Facebook and Google and Microsoft and Apple all wish to be the operating systems of our lives. They're explicit about this. They don't just want to be on the web because the web is 20 years old, and it's actually kind of creaky.  What they want to do is be there with you all the time in your glasses, in your pocket, in your purse and on your mind always.  They want to be your personal assistant. There's quote after quote after quote from every CEO of every one of these Intelligence Squared U.S. - 55 - companies that that's what they want.  And it might make things really cool for us.  But it's not going to make things rich and diverse.  It's not going to be the wonderful conversation that we could have had on the web if we hadn't instigated these gated communities, these operating systems of our lives.  We're on the way to having a Balkanized world and a Balkanized society because of these gated communities.  The fact is, nothing is determined here.  We can decide that we like what the web was supposed to be.  We can opt out of certain of these practices.  We should encourage diversity, encourage other platforms.  We should encourage experimentation.  We should recognize that Facebook and Google and Yahoo! and Bing and Apple and Microsoft are designed to gratify us immediately.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 4 -', 'No, because China still is a fickle mistress and a very difficult place to finally divine.', 'Well, I find myself in the awkward position, being an American, deeply believing in this country and its ability to innovate and in its entrepreneurial powers, to defend a Marxist-Leninist economy.  And I beg you to marshal every bit of scrutiny you can to my argument and please convince me I am wrong by voting against me at the end of this debate. I would say that the comparison between capitalism in the United States and China is as much divided by the fact that capitalism here has in many ways failed its promise.  And there, in a very counterintuitive way, one we hardly have expected, the Chinese Communist Party has managed to graft on a certain kind of guerilla mobility under Leninist rigidity to make their system actually function in a way which I think all of us would agree, over the past three decades, has been quite extraordinary -- something Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - none of us who were standing in the middle of Tiananmen Square of 1989 when there were a million people demonstrating there, thought could ever possibly happen. So, I think if we look at America, we find a country that is in quite a bit of psychological self-doubt at this particular moment.  We find a country that has had much of its government, many of its leaders besieged by irrationality, religiosity, they dont believe in evolution, they dont believe in climate change, we cannot pass a simple measure in Congress to extend the national debt, which is not going to not happen.  How can a government that is so paralyzed by its own inability to see reason, how can it be the custodian over that critical part of every economy that a government must preside over? This is not to say that we dont venerate entrepreneurs, we dont venerate innovation, and we dont believe in a free economy.  But let me read you just simply what Adam Smith had to say, the great patron saint of laissez faire capitalism.  He said that when the security of the whole society is at stake, natural liberty of a few individuals which might endanger that security ought to be restrained by the laws of all governments, the most free as well as the most despotical.  And I think it is precisely here that we have failed.  And by doing so, we have lent a greater credence to this curious, cryptic, hybrid version of Leninist capital, which China has employed, to quite a bit of success, I would have to say. So let\\'s quickly just look at what we see in China.  I spoke of the psychological dimension of the problem in this country, and I think everybody in this room feels it.  There is a sense of I think lassitude.  At the same time, greed is quite a force lost in the land. There\\'s a great deal of self deception at work.  If you look at China, who\\'s running the government in China now?  They\\'re all engineers.  In many ways, the very things that we used to impute to China as a great weakness, namely, a over reliance on ideology, are now the very things that are hampering our own country, while China, governed by engineers and technocrats, tends to look at reason.  There are no climate deniers in China.  I have never spoken to a Chinese who doubted evolution. And yet the ranks of the American political houses of Congress are replete with these people, and they\\'re making decisions which govern how we live and govern the American economy.  China also has managed in a way that I think it deserves our esteem to combine the public with the private and to act when things need to be done. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 15 - When a stimulus program needs to be enacted, they look at the facts and they enact it. Do you remember when we looked at five-year plans as quaint kind of throwbacks to some retrograde period of Stalinist economics?  Well, I think the United States could do with a good five-year plan. We can\\'t plan for three months ahead. We have no ability even to execute policy, much less long range policy.  If you go to Washington, you find more and more people utterly despairing of writing policy documents. Why?  Because nobody can do anything with them.  I think this ability of China to martial facts rationally, to martial its resources and make policy and allocate capital where it needs to be allocated in times of crisis is something that our own country could learn from.  I want to read a quick quote from Henny Sender from the Financial Times.  \"The combination of Chinese SOEs and debt from state owned banks is a powerful alliance that will increasingly resonate outside of China as well as within it.\"  I think that\\'s an interesting statement from a paper that\\'s basically a laissez faire capitalist paper. So finally I would say that we would do well not to assume that China has nothing to teach the United States.  It may be that this system will not endure in the future.  It has many structural weaknesses.  But to date I would say it has been ascending while our own form of capitalism, replete with the weaknesses that you all well know, has been in a state of decline.  And whether we have the ability to grab it at the last minute from its final collapse is a question which will remain for years to come.', 'You know, this isnt exclusively about one country or another.  Were doing a comparison here, and were talking about recent history, not an idealized America.  And wed be very foolish to idealize China.  And I think what we have to reckon with is the chances of each country finding a new state of equipoise, the United States included.  It is not a foregone conclusion that were going to pull this thing out of the water. I think if this country cannot grasp reason again, it doesnt matter how good or bad China will be, China may have an unfair advantage.  I think whats going on in Washington right now is so utterly mad and broken that I put no confidence whatsoever in their ability to play that central role that every government, and I may disagree with you here, Peter, but every government must play.  And we are not playing it.', 'Wait a minute. China is implementing -- trying to implement a health care system, a Social Security system, and when you say the Chinese people have gotten nothing out of the last 30 years of development, you have surely seen the infrastructure that China has built, which benefits everybody in some way or other.', \"Well, you look at the highway system, you look at the rails system, we haven't built a tunnel in New York City since the 1920s and the 1930s.  China's throwing these things up Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - overnight, bridges, subway systems, you name it.  Now, I don't want to idealize China's system, but I do want to give credit where credit is due, and it is unfair to say that no benefit is derived from the amazing development of the last 30 years.\", 'Well, the real question is sustainability of our own enterprise.  Ian, you\\'ve just written a wonderful book called, \"Every Nation for Itself,\" and I thought it very interesting to read the following.  You talk about the serious psychological toll in this country of the financial crisis and the near economic collapse. And you say, worse still is the fear that Americas leaders cant fix these problems because the U.S. political system is broken beyond repair.  Is it?', 'And you dont, you believe that we will regain our sense and be able to restore reason to our decision making and pull out of this nadir of --', 'Well, I think its interesting, its still, the United States has tremendous luster.  I mean it is a great dream machine and we have a great country and many Chinese would like to live here.  But what is interesting in the last few years is the number of Chinese whove gone home. And theyve gone home because they see opportunity.  They feel -- anyone whos been to China lately feels an amazing sense of energy.  And I would have to say that these great American virtues of get it done, whatever it takes, can do, I feel, and Im surprised, more and more, have been incarnate in China and less and less in America.', 'The complex answer to your question is no. [laughter]', 'You know, I think the United States has, over the last decade, been not exactly exemplary as an evangelist for human rights, which has stilled our voice to some degree. This is an aspect of the Chinese system which is not exemplary.  And we dont need to and wouldnt want to imitate it.  But having said that, I think we have to be honest that authoritarian capitalism has been able to do things that a freer form of capitalism sometimes fails to be able to do.', 'Peter, may I respectfully say that the subject of our discussion --', \"-- is really not this.  What we're really discussing is which economy does marketization best.\", 'No. [laughter]', 'Here I would say the advantage is emphatically on the American side because we have immigration.  China does not and China has one of the most rapidly aging populations. And the lower reaches are not being replenished with the one-child policy, so its going to have a huge burden of taking care of elderly people and not have younger people coming in on the bottom to support them.  Thats going to be a giant problem.', 'This is a huge problem for China.  And China is creating intellectual property, and as it does, I think its going to bring itself to heel.  One hopes it will, and it simply must or it cant be a world player.  But China must move up the value chain, because the labor is getting more expensive.  Theyre just lower down than we are.  America doesnt do much manufacturing anymore, not as much as it used to.  Its had to move up the value chain into knowledge and information technology.  Thats Chinas challenge too.', \"Quick comment.  You know, I think what Ian said is very true. I was recently on the Vice President Xi's visit.  And we went to California, and I was there with Governor Brown to meet him and meet a bunch of governors.  Every one of those governors and party secretaries came with 10 guys in black suits, you know, for trade, for energy, for manufacturing.  Brown had me, you know, a non-paid friend.  And it was very evident to me that the state capitalism of China had this incredible sort of plug-in mechanism and we didnt have a socket.  And I think thats going to have to change if we want to do business with China.  These guys wanted to do business. They love California, and they cant find a way to do it.  We need it.\", \"Well, I have to say, I mean, this is something America does exceedingly well.  This is the part of American capitalism that really works -- our innovation, our scaling -- our bringing stuff to market, scaling it up, Silicon Valley.  And China does this less well, but I have to say Ive been around this block for a number of decades.  And what I see happening in China is a lot of incredibly interesting self-made entrepreneurs bubbling up from underneath.  Where they go, where the private sector of the economy goes, can it become the majority sector?  That remains to be seen.  But this is a very vibrant place. Don't write it off for one second.\", \"There is innovation, not full spectrum. They don't have Nobel Laureates yet at this far end, but there is innovation.  These guys are crafty.  They are good.  They are smart, and boy they're on a roll.\", 'Well Minxin, amen.  I really want to agree with you and I truly hope youre right.  It would be nice.  But who would have thought five or 10 years ago, that we would be sitting here tonight even having this debate, that there would be any kind of equilibrium even to discuss between these two great economic systems.  No one.  Twenty years ago, impossible.  Thirty years ago when I first went to China, it was unthinkable.  China is undeniably in transition.  We are a more finished product trying to regain our balance.  And I worry about the United States.  I think we have a good model, but I think we havent played it very well.  I think weve deceived ourselves.  I think weve fallen into a lot of self deception about what has made this country great and strong.  Its a combination between regulation and control and wisdom at the top setting an equitable and fair system and a free market with a vibrant set of entrepreneurs and innovators at the bottom.  China is still trying to find its balance between these things.  I dont know where theyre going to go.  I dont know how its going to end up.  I cant see the future for us or them, but I can see the last five or 10 years. And I think everyone in this room should acknowledge that despite all its imperfections, despite the human rights questions, despite all of these other things, that what China has accomplished, as counterintuitive as it was, no one could have predicted it, is pretty extraordinary.  Something has been working pretty well.  We dont know where its going to go in the future, and all we can do is sit and wait.  But if we want to fix something, were not going to fix China.  The question is are we going to fix ourselves.']\n",
      "['Well, first of all, in fairness to Congressman Ron Paul, he really didnt need my advice. He should be giving advice to his opponents.  But as far as China, being wrong in what respect?  Are you talking about my investments in China?', 'Yeah, you know, I think that Chinas story is unfolding, and I think there is tremendous opportunity for investors to make money as China continues on its journey towards capitalism.  I think they are abandoning some of the ideas of the past, not necessarily in favor of what America is today. Hopefully maybe more what America used to be in the past.  But if Im wrong, if the political winds blow in a different direction and China doesnt live up to the potential that I think it has, Ive got investments all around the world.  Its not only China.', 'But -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 -', \"I'll need a timer.  All right, it's -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 -\", 'Oh, okay.  Go right ahead.', \"Well, I'm the only one on the show.\", 'That\\'s all you can come up with?  As was stated, China is a communist nation in name only. It\\'s not communist in the way the Soviet Union was communist.  And unfortunately China kind of gives communism a good name in a way that we give capitalism a bad name.  And I thought maybe a more appropriate way to have framed this debate is not, you know, \"Does China do capitalism better?\" but it might -- but might be, \"Does America do capitalism worse than China?\" because neither modern America or China does capitalism anywhere near as well as we did it in the 19th century.  But the problem is China is closer to what America used to be than America is today. And if you think about America at the end of the 19th century in the year 1900, the government in this country spent 3 percent of the GDP on all levels, 3 percent. Today Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - the American government spends better than 40 percent of our GDP.  If you look at China, it\\'s about half as much of the GDP spent.  If you look at taxes, which is a real measure of freedom, back in America in the 1900s, we had no income taxes, we had no corporate income tax, no state income taxes, Americans were truly free in the sense that they got to keep the production, the fruits of their labor.  If you look at modern America and modern China, taxes are very high.  They\\'re just a lot higher here than they are in China. Individual income taxes, the typical American pays a much higher share of his income in taxes when you take income taxes on a federal and state level and payroll taxes and the employer portion that\\'s passed on, paying much higher income taxes on a personal level than the typical Chinese worker does.  If you look at corporations, our corporate income tax now is, what, 35 percent, China\\'s 25, we tax dividends at 15 percent, they\\'re at 10 percent, so a significant difference in the amount of money that the individuals are allowed to keep. You know, the American government is taking a much larger share of what people earn, and that\\'s what\\'s freedom, it\\'s keeping the fruits of your labor.  Also, if you look at the regulatory environment in both China and the United States, I would argue that a young entrepreneur in America today is going to face much greater hurdles, bigger obstacles in his path that have been placed there by the government than you would have in China. The costs of complying with all the rules and regulations in America exceeds the costs in China, and not just the rules and regulations, but surviving the litigation that is a byproduct of those rules and regulations.  A lot of the things that the government does, if employers don\\'t do them properly, they open themselves up to all sorts of lawsuits, not just by government but by their employees or their customers and you don\\'t face that kind of problem to anywhere near that extent in China. So if you look at it from the point of view of taxation, you look at it from the point of view of regulation, sure, both countries have a lot of regulation.  I mean, China is not as capitalistic as Hong Kong, which is a part of China but is more capitalistic than the mainland.  But if you\\'re going to compare it to the United States, the level of taxation, the level of government spending, if you look at the debt, I mean, America has -- our government has an enormous debt.  Our debt is now 100 percent of our GDP, and that is if you just count the funded portion of our debt.  If you look at the off budget items, the unfunded portion of our debt, it\\'s enormous.  The Chinese government doesn\\'t have anywhere near that kind of liability.  In fact, if you look at China and the United States and just compare the results of their economy.  China is today, the worlds largest creditor  nation.  America is the worlds biggest debtor nation.  China has large trade surpluses.  America has enormous trade deficits. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - So if you thought about it as a nation, China has got -- I mean if you thought about the nation as a country, or as a corporation rather, China has a lot of assets on its balance sheet and lots of income, lots of profits.  America is loaded up with liabilities and were hemorrhaging red ink.  We have huge losses.  So if you think that America is more capitalist than China or China is more socialist, then you must think that socialism is a better economic system because after all, the Chinese are more successful if you want to measure it by the accumulation of assets, by the positive balance of trade.  So, and I dont think that there is a way for a country, if you remember the Soviet Union, which was a Communist country, the Soviet Union didnt make anything, they didnt produce anything. We constantly had to give them money so that they can feed themselves. Pretty much everything is being made in China today and the United States; they have this enormous trade surplus. And more importantly, theyre accumulating massive savings.  If you look at China, they have a savings rate of close to 50 percent.  We have a savings rate, basically negative.  In fact we rely in America on a Ponzi scheme called Social Security.  They dont have Social Security in China.  They dont have a lot of these big government programs that we have in the United States.  Look at our monetary system.  We have the Federal Reserve, price fixing, interest rates at practically zero.  In all the macroeconomics and balances that we create, we micromanage our economy through our tax code.   Weve got the U.S. government subsidizing or guaranteeing of almost 100 percent of all the mortgages in the United States, so its not up to the free market.  Credit isnt being allocated by the market; its being allocated by government.  Government is deciding who should get money and who shouldnt get money and who it should subsidize and who it should penalize.  It does all of this through the tax code and through the Federal Reserve. Yes, youve got something similar going on in China, only in China I think its more above board.  Yes, there is government and you know that governments involved and maybe you have to bribe the right bureaucrat, but the same thing is going on in the United States. Were just not as above board with it.  And if you think about the partnership that government has with business in the United States, most of the laws and regulations, and I work in a highly regulated field in the securities industry, but this is the same with industries all over the United States.  You have all these regulatory bodies that are created for the specific purpose of destroying competition and trying to prevent smaller firms from coming into existence or competing with these large firms that have captured all the regulatory bodies that oversee them.  And that is a function of government, and its a combination of big business working with big government to stifle innovation and to stifle capitalism.  And when you have the U.S. government taking such an enormous share of our GDP and taking such an enormous share of our Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - output in taxation and then trying to regulate it and micromanage it from Washington D.C., were not even close to being a capitalist country anymore in the United States. The unfortunate thing is that China is closer.  But whats more important is the direction in which the pendulum is swinging.  In China, its swinging towards capitalism. Unfortunately in America, its swinging away.', 'Well, first of all, there are a lot of countries that are starting on low baselines that are not having any kind of economic growth at all.  So, the difference is you do have more capitalism now in China, and its that freedom, its that -- those market forces that are responsible for the growth, not that because theyre poor, because there were plenty of people that were poor and that didnt grow at all.  As far as whether the trajectory is sustainable, I think not only is it just sustainable, but I think its going to get better because the real country thats headed for a crisis is America. And I think whats dragging the Chinese down is their currency peg.  Theyre loaning America all this money, so American can keep buying the products that Americans really cant afford. And so, as a result, the Chinese are debasing their currency and theyre creating a lot of inflation, which is destabilizing their economy and, I think, undermining the standard of living of their own citizens, which would be rising even faster if the Chinese government simply let the RMB rise in value, let the dollar tank.  If the Chinese government didnt take so much of the Chinese production and just loan it to America so that it could be squandered on big government and consumption, but I think eventually --', 'Well, I think theyre going to figure this out, and theyre not going to play this game anymore.  And the real crash is coming here, because then interest rates skyrocket, the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - dollar tanks, consumer prices go through the roof, and we have our Greek moment, only theres no Europe to bail us out.', 'Yeah, its not fair to the Greeks. [laughter]', 'Youve got to read my book.', 'Well, you know --', 'Not that particular point, but theres some other points that he made earlier that Id --', 'Well, first of all, one of the things that you mentioned, you said that American citizens, we get all kinds of benefits from our government that the Chinese citizens dont get. Well, I would say that we get a lot more liability.  If you try to figure out what each American share is of the national debt, it is enormous.  And what the government is giving the American people is debt.  I would much rather -- and if youre talking about capitalism, youre defending capitalism by saying we get Social Security, whats capitalistic about essentially planned retirement thats financed like Bernie Madoff ran his investment business.  I think its much better that the Chinese are free to keep their income and plan for their retirement.', 'What are you talking about?', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 - We owe them over $2 trillion.', \"Well, that's three trillion, if you want --\", 'Are you saying that liabilities exceed that?', 'Well, certainly --', 'You talk about the profits of the U.S. corporations, we\\'ll see how real those profits are when interest rates go up and they\\'re facing an entirely different environment.

We still live pretty good because we\\'re able to borrow all this money. We have a phony economy that is perpetuated based on debt.  When this debt bubble bursts and this whole thing comes toppling down, it\\'s going to be a whole different story.  I don\\'t doubt that people would want to live in America, given our lifestyle.  But that\\'s going to change.  You\\'re not looking at what\\'s keeping it going.  You\\'re not looking at all this debt. And you\\'re saying, \"Well, the Chinese are going to throw good amount of money after bad forever because they have no choice.\"  They do have a choice.  The more good money they throw after bad, the more money they\\'re going to lose, and the Chinese are figuring this out.', \"It's better than buying treasuries. [talking simultaneously]\", 'I would prefer they did neither and just let their citizens keep their money.', '-- unsustainable U.S. --', 'Well, if you, first looking at your discussions about debt.  We didnt have any serious discussions.  That trillion dollars in cuts was an illusion.  It was spread out over 10 years, so its 100 billion a year in almost a $4 trillion budget and it was simply reductions in the proposed rate of increases.  So we werent even talking about dealing with the problem. But you are right, we dont have to deal with it because both the Federal Reserve continues to print dollars and buy treasuries and the Chinese central bank and foreign central banks continue to print their own currencies and buy dollars and buy treasuries. So we are the ones that are literally living on borrowed time.  Youve got to think, whats going to happen in America when like Europe, we are forced to deal with the enormity of the consequences. If you look at our federal debt, which is the funded portion, is financed like a sub-prime mortgage with a teaser rate.  How is the U.S. government going to handle 5 or 10 percent interest rates on this national debt?  How is the banking system in America going to handle it when all their assets are imploding, their long-term government bonds and mortgages that they have on their books and they cant get cheap money anymore from the Fed.  What happens to our housing market?', 'I would argue that our labor market is hardly a bastion of freedom either.  I mean, first of all, we have a minimum wage law that effectively makes it illegal to hire a pretty sizable chunk of our population that cant get a job.  But even for the Americans who are employed, you have the government dictating to employers all sorts of criteria upon which they have to base their decisions on who to hire and who to promote, and therere all sorts of mandates that, as an employer, you are required. You have to do this, you have to do that, at often great expense to yourself.  So, I dont think you have a lot of freedom in the U.S. labor markets.  There are so many different ways you can be sued as an employer in this country that a lot of people do what they can to avoid hiring people because they dont want to get within the crosshairs of the government or the legal system that has sprung as a result of all these mandates. So, I would think that if youre an employer in China and youre hiring people, I dont think that you have to worry about that as much as an employer in America, that youre going to be sued by your employee because you, you know, you passed them over for a promotion or maybe you didnt hire somebody and they want to sue you and claim its because youre, you know, youre handicapped or youre a different race.

And when you do that, you diminish freedom, and you diminish liberty in the country, but apart from that, you create all sorts of problems for the businesses because now the businesses have to spend all sorts of money to protect themselves against lawsuits.

Do you have more right now in China or do you have more in the United States?  And my argument earlier is that the typical person in China is going to surrender less of his economic output to his government in the form of taxation, and I don't think his day-to-day life is going to be as impacted as heavily as they are in America as far as regulations.

And I do believe that the Chinese are going to see the error of their ways.  And when they allow this change to happen, when they allow an appreciation in the value of their currency and they allow their citizens to more fully reap the rewards of their hard work and their savings, I think youre going to see a much greater growth trajectory in China.

Most likely it will be inflation.  I mean, it could be default, but the more likely outcome is that we simply print so much money that the bondholders are deprived of their purchasing power.  And that is not a free market.  A free market would have sound money.  It wouldnt have the government issuing a currency by fiat and then deciding to punish savers at the expense of debtors, which is going to happen in the United States, especially when you realize that the U.S. government, being the largest debtor of us all, is going to benefit more from inflation than any other debtor.', \"Entrepreneurship is a -- we think about somebody starting at a high tech company, I mean, an entrepreneur could just be a guy that goes out and, you know, starts a fruit stand or a supermarket.

And there are a lot of entrepreneurs making a lot of profit in China.  They're not, not there.  There are a lot of them, and the population of entrepreneurs is growing, and are self-made millionaires in China and more and more of them are being created, and that is going to continue.

Everybody had second homes and it was great.  But of course it was a bubble and it couldnt last.  And thats the same thing with the U.S. economy.  If you want to look at the U.S. economy and measure it by how much money we spend and how much we consume.  You look at some of these statistics that you reference about our competitiveness, when the reality is if were so competitive, where are all the products and why do we have a huge trade deficit?  I think whats really happening here is we have a bubble in the entire economy and it is based on excess consumption, excess debt. The Chinese, theyre not making a big bet on the U.S. treasury market because they want to.  Its because they think they have to.  If they can wave a wand and replace all their treasures with gold, theyd do it.  The problem is theyre afraid.  Because they know if they try to sell, theyll crush the market.  But we are on the verge of this collapse.  And its because we abandoned all the principles of capitalism that we once had.  And these are the principles that China is now adopting.  As I said earlier, whats really more important is the pendulum and the direction in which its swinging.  Look at where we started from complete capitalism.  And China started, they had none of it. Look at how much ground weve surrendered and look at how much the Chinese have gained.  Is China perfect?  Not at all. They still have a lot of progress to make.  But they are making that progress.  The problem with us is were still moving in the wrong direction.  And were moving in that direction more rapidly.  And when we actually have our crisis; when we have a sovereign debt crisis, when the dollar really plunges and we really have to confront the grim reality of our situation, the fact that weve been living beyond our means for generations and it has to come to an end, then we can have this debate again.

      "[\"I became a Pew Foundation scholar in nutrition and metabolism because in medical school, I learned nothing.  I didn't have a minute of nutrition taught to me.  Yet here I was in the critical care unit where people -- where people's lives were at stake.  I had to keep them alive with food.  And I was the most clueless person of all.  I went back to school.\", 'Obesity is the government\\'s business.  You hear from the opposing side that we\\'re looking at a nanny state or food policing.   Au contraire, that\\'s not what we\\'re looking for at all. Voluntary?  We give you voluntary.  That\\'s what we\\'re looking for.  I wear many hats.  I\\'m a physician first, and I hail from the front trenches, face to face with my patients and as chief lifestyle expert for WebMD\\'s 90 million members, click to click with my cyber folks.   This is where I practice high-tech touch.  I set up a discussion group asking, is obesity the government\\'s business?  It lit up like Kyoto at nighttime.  It was fabulous.  The bottom line was, yes, obesity is the government\\'s business for leadership, education, protection, options, opportunities, infrastructure. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - No sidewalk, no walk.  No park, no play.  No bike path, lots of accidents.  Bottom line, what they said was, \"No blame, no shame.  No tax, no bans.\"  They drew a line in the sand.  And Dr. Satcher and I agree with that.  Obesity is the government\\'s business. I\\'m going to flip now to my public health hat.  Government cannot solve the obesity problem alone.  A problem as large as obesity, pun fully intended, requires all sectors of society to bring our thinking to the table.  So I argue for government private sector partnerships. Shouldn\\'t be just the government at all.  When we initiate a voluntary campaign or an effort, we want to be able to offer people options and opportunities because if there is no choice, there can be no moderation. We\\'re in New York City.  I love this place.  And although you just heard that some of what you\\'re doing isn\\'t working so well, I say, forget all that.  You have programs here, for instance, Mayor Bloomberg has joined with 500 other mayors with the \"let\\'s move cities and town\" campaign to be able to work, drill down into the neighborhoods.  What we can do to be able to improve physical activity as well as nutrition.  In addition, the \"fresh\" program, food retailed expansion to support health programs.  Say that three times.  The food retail expansion to support health program has set up 14 supermarkets in food deserts.  This was a private-public collaboration, a partnership that worked.  We now have fresh produce out there.  And that\\'s really important. Of course, we have so many other measures that have taken place.  Good grief, we have play streets.  We\\'ve taken quiet streets and turned them into play yards because we have nothing else out there.  We\\'re using what we can.  We\\'re doing what we can.  At the national level, obviously we\\'re looking at prevention now.  The national prevention and health promotion strategy to stop disease before it starts.  Million hearts campaign. Let\\'s Move actually celebrates its second anniversary this month alone.  And it\\'s been reaching out to everyone from REI for outdoor, you know, to a beverage industry for clear on calories so you can begin to understand what\\'s going on in those labels.  Is it perfect?  Absolutely not.  Is it voluntary, and does it touch people\\'s lives?  Hell yeah.  I\\'m on the board of America on the Move, and we\\'re moving.  We have corporate sponsors. We do private, public sponsorships all year long.  We do this in neighborhoods, in states all across this country.  We touch people.

Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - And here we see again trying to show people that there are simple, small steps, literally, that you can take to be able to help yourself, voluntary, nothing stuffed up your nose. We\\'re not going to the tax and ban place.  We\\'re not food policing.  We\\'re reaching out asking people to hold our hand and say, come on.  We can do this together.  Is it sloppy? Yeah. Are we perfect?  No.  We\\'re about as perfect as the people who create them and implement them.  We\\'re human.  We\\'re getting there. I\\'m going to switch over to my last hat for my seven minutes as a researcher.  Guess what? The National Institutes of Health is public funding.  $32 billion to save your lives, to do the work we do. It\\'s interesting, when I began my work there as a senior scientist, I went to the clinical director\\'s office, and above the office there was a sign that said, \"In God we trust,\" and there was a little sign below it that said, \"Everyone else must show data.\" [laughter] Fairly straightforward.  We wanted to see some good data here.  And so in our laboratory we showed the connection between chronic stress for instance and the buildup of that toxic fat deep inside your belly which increases your risk for heart disease and diabetes.  We showed for instance that it\\'s not about ELMM, \"Eat less, move more.\"  That\\'s so important, however, so much bigger.  We forgot the mind. What about stress?  New research has just been published showing that children who are stressed, and you know what that\\'s about, in their childhood, at home, at school, eat more, and that\\'s that stress-fat connection that we talk about so often.  What are we doing about that? We have a new science called, \"epigenetics,\" we\\'re trying to look at how we can literally change gene expression, how we turn on and off genes, by simply doing easy things like if I eat an apple every day on a regular basis I get that gene expression and therefore I\\'m able to what?  Have an increased or decreased vulnerability toward obesity.  Or I could just do what so many people do, that nocturnal mnage  trois every night, you know what I\\'m talking about, you, Ben, and Jerry. [laughter] All together in bed watching the tube, hanging out, doing it.  Doesn\\'t work, all right? What\\'s that gene expression looking like?  All right.  So here we\\'re looking at something that\\'s a brand new phenomenon, something we love to call \"secondhand obesity.\" What we\\'re looking at is virally, families, what\\'s going on with them?  How are we Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - touching kids?  It\\'s so much bigger than demonizing sugar.  It\\'s so much bigger, so much bigger than saying the government\\'s just too fat.

Apparently Paul is not aware of the national weight control registry.  This is an ongoing study, almost 20 years old, which has been sponsored by the University of Colorado as well as Brown University, my colleagues, Dr. James Hill and Rena Wing.  The cohort right now is over 10,000 people, including people who have bariatric surgery as well.  And these people are known as the successful losers. And actually, Paul, you actually are too, because of your own weight loss as you noted in your book.  You qualify because you had to have dropped at least 30 pounds Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - and kept it off for at least a year.  And the grand majority of these people have kept off approximately 60 pounds for almost six years or longer.  And this is on the average in a very large cohort.  So are these mutants? Freaks?  What are they?  These people have determined that they will keep this weight off by utilizing very simple things.  And this has been published in extensive literature.

Its not just about dropping weight but being healthier.  This was a small little house.  It was 97 degrees in the middle of summer.  There were no sidewalks.  Or what was there was scary-looking. And we were asked to go out and take a little walk.  And I looked near the front door, and there was a golf club sitting there.  Now, the closest golf course was probably about 100 miles away.  So I asked what was that sitting there for.  And the mother looked at me and she said, Thats to beat away the dogs, the feral dogs that are running all over the place from the drug lords who are either jailed, dead or MIA and just so we can get to our car. And I said, You have a dog yourself.  Where do you walk it?  We have to drive three-four miles away to a small park, and thats what we do.  So I went out, and I took a walk with them because my producers told me to.  And we went outside, and I took the fastest walk of my life.  And as we were coming around and we were being filmed, of course, the producers were in a car and I was on the sidewalk or whatever was out there, I noticed the dogs coming.  They were about three blocks away, totally freaked me out. And I realized, wow, lets break into a run.  Youre walking so well.  Lets run.  And so we did, and I ran for my life.

      "[\"Well, it was sort of a surprise when we saw what had happened over a 20-year period and the direction that we were going in terms of increasing obesity.  So we didn't know how long it would take to begin to turn what we call the epidemic around.\", 'Thank you.  Well, we contend that obesity is definitely the government\\'s business.  My favorite story I think about policymakers is a story about a man who was traveling across the country in a hot air balloon, and at a certain point he realized that he was lost, he had no idea where he was, so he decided that he would lower the balloons and see if he could see some recognizable landmarks.  So he lowered the balloon, couldn\\'t see anything that he recognized, no Golden Gate bridge, no Washington Monument, so he had no idea where he was.  So he kept lowering the balloon, and when he got to about 30 feet above ground he saw a man working in the field.  So he yelled out, \"Where am I?\" and the man stopped digging in the field, and he said, \"Well, you\\'re in a hot air balloon about 30 feet above ground.\" [laughter] Well, the man in the balloon said, \"You sound like a scientist.  Do you work in science?\" And the man on the ground said, \"My goodness, I am a scientist.  But how in the world did you know that?\"  Said, \"Well, I knew that because what you told me is technically correct but it is of absolutely no use to me right now.\" [laughter] Well, not to be outdone, the man on the ground said, \"Well, you sound like one of those policymakers from Washington or somewhere.\"  And the man in the balloon said, \"I am. I\\'m an outstanding policymaker.  I\\'m a leader.  But how did you know that?\"  And the man on the ground said, \"I knew that because you\\'re in the same position you were when we met, you don\\'t know where you are, you don\\'t know where you\\'re going, and now you\\'re blaming me.\" [laughter] Well, let me say that I spent nine years in government, five as director of the CDC, and as you\\'ve heard, four as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health, and I have to tell you, I would trade nothing for those nine years. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - They were rich years.  The people with whom I worked were special.  So I am very excited about the role of government in dealing with a problem like obesity.  Let me just say a few of the things I was involved in.  In 1996, while director of CDC, we released a very interesting report on physical activity.  It was actually released as a surgeon general\\'s report, and basically what we showed in that report on physical activity was that there was a dramatic decline in physical activity among the American people, including schools no longer requiring physical education, K through 12.  And so we expressed a lot of concerns about the sedentary lifestyles of American people and the implications of that. In 1999, I represented the United States at a world conference on health promotion and disease prevention.  And at that conference for the first time I released the surgeon general\\'s Prescription  [to the American People], which I\\'m sure many of you are familiar with, but among the things on that prescription was the recommendation for regular physical activity, at least 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week, but also a recommendation that the American people consume at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day.  There were other things on the prescription, even one having to do with mental health and the need to have some planned strategy for dealing with stress. We didn\\'t really understand at that time the relationship between things like physical activity and depression, the fact that physical activity is a major intervention for reducing depression.  Then in 2001, as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health, I released the surgeon general\\'s Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Overweight and Obesity. there had been a tripling of overweight and obesity among children in this country and a doubling among adults.  So we did sound the alarm, and even though I was former director of the CDC and we are very selective at what we call \"epidemics,\" usually reserved for infectious diseases, we declared that overweight and obesity was an epidemic in this country.  We didn\\'t realize at that time that the same thing was beginning to happen all over the world.  In that report of the surgeon general on overweight and obesity, we especially expressed concern about the changes in the maps throughout the country, where you could actually map the increase in overweight and obesity in various states, whereas in 1990, 15 percent was almost the high. By the year 2001, it was 25 to 30 percent of the American people who were obese. What we know about overweight and obesity from a population perspective is very important, I think, to this debate because what we know is that it has increased Intelligence Squared U.S. - 8 - dramatically, but also that it is clearly associated with an increase in chronic diseases, especially what we call Type II diabetes, or increases in what we call BMI, the way we measure body fat, directly related to an increase in Type II diabetes.  And, as you know, Type II diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and even renal disease. So we were concerned about what was happening in this country.  We were concerned about the implication of these rising rates of overweight and obesity.  We were also concerned about disparities.  We have declared the goal of eliminating disparities in health in this country, especially among different racial and ethnic groups.  And what we observed, of course, was that this epidemic was disproportionately impacting African Americans and American Indians.  So, American Indians also have the highest rate of Type II diabetes. And African Americans have the highest mortality rates from Type II diabetes.  So we were very concerned about the impact that this was having on eliminating disparities in health.  We were also concerned about what was happening in children.  I think this was really critical. What we found was that children, by increasing overweight and obesity, were now getting what we previously had called adult-onset diabetes. We were seeing it in children.  We were seeing hypertension in children.  Pediatricians were expressing great concerns.', 'Thank you. [applause]', \"Well, I think the evidence is related to several things.  First, we had a very interesting study funded by NIH in the late '90s, early part of this 2000. And basically showed that if we could get people to be physically active and to change their diet, even if they lost only five to 15 percent of their weight, we could dramatically decrease the risk for diabetes, in fact almost 60 percent reduction among African- Americans and American Indians in the onset of Type II diabetes, by getting people to Intelligence Squared U.S. - 18 - change their lifestyles and to be more physically active and to consume diets with less saturated fats and sugars.  So I think we do know, from that study, that it's possible to help people change lifestyles.  And I did say help because Pamela is correct, there are a lot of people in this country who do not have access to healthy lifestyles.  And it is in fact a responsibility of government to make sure that everybody has the opportunity, everybody has access to the opportunity for healthy lifestyles.\", 'The track record that I mentioned was the one dealing with African-Americans and American Indians in terms of reducing --', '-- the risk for diabetes mellitus.', 'Well, I think a couple of things.  The goal of these programs is to help children develop lifetime habits of physical activity and good nutrition. We also know, by the way, that children who develop good eating habits and regular physical activity do better academically.  They perform better on standardized exams in math and reading.  They are more disciplined in school.  So the benefits of healthy lifestyles go far beyond losing weight. Now, Paul quoted the statistics about weight loss versus decrease in diabetes.  The goal is to decrease fat.  And sometimes you can decrease fat and increase muscle and not lose weight.  But you still reduce the risk of diabetes.  I think you know that as a runner.', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - Excuse --', \"Well, let's be clear, though.\", \"It's not the information.  It's the opportunity to act on it. I think what Pamela described in terms of in the inner cities of the countryyou don't have sidewalks, you don't have safe places to be physically active, you don't have access to grocery stores, so what you're talking about is the opportunity --\", '-- to leave --', 'Yeah, in some --', 'Look at what Louisville did.

Obesity is an outcome, in many cases, of unhealthy lifestyles.  Its not that simple.  We differ in terms of metabolism.  Therere some people who can eat a lot of calories and not gain a lot of weight.  There are other people who gain weight easily. So everybodys not equal. Were not stigmatizing people who are obese.  Read the surgeon general's report, clearly says this is not about appearances.  It's about health.  And the way to improve health is to change lifestyles. That's what the report says. [applause]\", 'You start off by quoting --', \"-- Lincoln, so I'll quote Lincoln who said that it is the role of government to do for people what they cannot do for themselves.  And that's what we're talking about here.\", \"Not if they don't have safe places to be physically active, not if they don't have access to fresh fruits and vegetables.\", \"That's a great question --\", \"-- that you raise.  Let me just say that 80 percent of Medicare costs -- and Medicare is the most expensive program that government supports in terms of health.  80 percent of their costs are due to preventable diseases.  And certainly, half of that is related to obesity and Type II diabetes.  There's no question about it.  So it is true that the government has a self-interest to try to help people to develop healthy lifestyles.  And we're not even talking about obesity.  We're talking about the benefits of healthy lifestyles generally.  Less diabetes mellitus, which is a major driver of costs of Medicare and other health programs.\", \"Well, I think we ought to be clear.  You know, we are the government, and it is the role of government to create the conditions in which people can be healthy.  That's how we define public health.  That's how the Institute of Medicine defines public health.  It is the role of public health to create the condition. It's a collective effort to create the conditions in which people can be healthy.  And that's what we're talking about.\", \"Let me remind you that schools are supposed to be the great equalizers in this country. In other words, kids come to school, some of them come from communities where they have adequate places to play, access to fresh fruits and vegetables.  Other children come from homes where there's no place to play safely, no access to fresh fruits and vegetables.  At school at least they should be helped in developing lifetime habits of physical activity and good nutrition.\", 'Yeah, I think it\\'s an excellent question.  The government\\'s role can be put into three categories.  One is this assessment where you really monitor the health of the population, and you give us this kind of information that we can act on. The second one is assurance that everybody has access to the opportunity to lead healthy lifestyles.  The third one is policy.  And you\\'re right, it is the responsibility of government to develop guidelines for healthy eating.  The Nutrition Act that\\'s just passed is an effort to say, \"If we\\'re going to have free breakfast, free lunch in the schools for 40 to 50 percent of the children, we must make sure that those lunches are healthy, that they have adequate fruits and vegetables,\" I agree with you.  The third role of government is policy development, and that policy is made in such a way as to make sure, number one, we have the information that we need, weve got to have labels on the foods so we know what we\\'re getting, and also you\\'ve got to make sure the children who are receiving these lunches are getting healthy foods.', 'That is the role of government.', 'Well, well, I dont agree that governments fail.  Now, the study that youre talking about, I dont think anyone, even the ones who carried it out would see that as a conclusive study. What they said was to date, we dont see the evidence that changing the vending machines -- Male Speaker: Were going to keep doing more of it. Dr. David Satcher: We are going to keep working to help children develop lifetime habits of good nutrition and physical activity.  I think thats our responsibility.  And thats what the schools have to do.', 'Its amazing that the same thing was said about tobacco, the effort to get people to stop smoking, you know.  Go back to the 60s and the 70s.  Its not working.  Theres no evidence.  To date, we can point to millions and millions of peoples whose lives have been saved because of the efforts to get people to quit smoking.', \"Its a great point and a great question.  And I think thats exactly whats happening.  I think government is beginning to change the way we spend our money relative to foods, with children especially.  Look at the new nutrition act and the difference that it represents from what weve seen in the past in terms of the way children eat in school. So I think we are -- the government is responding to the studies that weve been talking about, showing how these foods are affecting lifestyles and therefore resulting in ill health, especially Type II diabetes, even in children.  So, youre right, we, the government, have been at fault in many ways in terms of whats going on in this country, in terms of subsidies as you pointed out. And hopefully we are making the changes that we need to make. It is the role of government to continue to learn and to grow and to change.  And that's what we're seeing now.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 46 - This is a great question.  And to be honest with you, I don't know, since everything becomes politicized.  You know -- Male Speaker: You bet. Dr. David Satcher: As surgeon general, what I said was that I'm not a politician.  I speak to the American people based on the best available public health science.  But believe me, there were a lot of political pressures on me every time I did a report.  But the fact of the matter is, the surgeon general's report is based on the best available public health science.  It has to be approved by the NIH.  It has to be approved by the CDC.  It has to be approved by HHS.  So government is imperfect.  And it's up to us to continue to make it more perfect, a more perfect union.  But it's up to us to continue to push the government --\", \"Well, the way to get the price down is to make more of it, right?  Isn't that what happens with -- happened with computers and everything?  So in time, we ought to be able to get the price of Fig Newtons down. [laughter]\", \"And the government -- Female Speaker: Am I not looking at a child to receive tax -- whose family receives tax funds -- sorry, tax- generated funds and brought their money to school and spent it on a machine instead of on their healthy lunch?  And by the way, 25 out of 28 students in my class, which is 95 percent free lunch, have cable TV.  I don't have a TV.\", '[unintelligible].', \"I think the government is the only actor.  Remember who the government is.  Public health is the collective efforts of a society to create the conditions in which people can be healthy. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 - Government calls upon all of us to work together to solve the problem.  It does it through public-private partnerships.  So it's not either/or.  We're not saying the government does this, and nobody else.  We need all hands in.  But if the government does not do its job, it will not get done because government has the resources, and nobody else does, to monitor the health of the population.  Government has the resources to make policies so that we can have an idea what people are eating and what they are exposed to in terms of information.\", \"So I think the government has a role that only the government can play.  But it doesn't mean nobody else does.\", 'Well, let me say that I have seen government at its worst and I\\'ve seen government at its best.  I know government is not perfect.  I grew up in Alabama at a time of segregation and discrimination.  I was a teenager when George Wallace, running for governor, came to town and said that he would deputize every white man in Alabama before he would see one black child go to the University of Alabama.  I\\'ve seen government at its worst.  But I\\'ve also seen government at its best.  I\\'ve seen government protect children from lead.  As a medical student I saw babies coming into emergency room with toxicity from lead.  Many of them died.  That was in the \\'60s.  In 1978, the government regulated the lead content of house paint, and we\\'ve seen a dramatic decline in lead poisoning in children.  I\\'ve seen government at its best. I\\'ve been involved in the eradication of polio, and all over the world, and recently learned that last year for the first time not one child in India suffered from polio.  And only three countries in the world have polio, a total of less than 700 cases in the world. Government at its best is \"We, the people.\"  Government is the collective efforts of a society to create the conditions in which people can be healthy.  So that\\'s what we see as government.  We believe that there is no substitute for individual responsibility.  Let\\'s make that clear.  It\\'s why I wrote the prescription.  But individual responsibility can only take place in an environment where there is equal opportunity, there is equal access to the opportunity for a healthy lifestyle.  It\\'s our contention that obesity is the business of the government because it is the business of the government to create those conditions.  Thank you. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 54 -']\n",

      "['I think the point is that admitting Palestine to the UN as a full member is in the best interest not only of the Palestinian people, but also of Israeli people.', 'And that it is in the best interest of peace with everybody.', \"Thank you so much.  And thank you for coming tonight, and thank you for inviting me to this debate.  I have four reasons that I would like to emphasize why Palestine should be admitted to the UN.  The first is that time is not an infinite commodity.  And time -- we're losing time.  And with the continuation of Israeli settlements on the ground, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - which are illegal, and after 20 years of failed negotiations, we cannot have the risk of losing the two-state solution. If Palestine is not accepted as a state very soon, there will be no two-state solution.  And the outcome will be dangerous and bad for everybody.  So we need the UN in this case to change the parameters, to change the course, the course of failure which Mr. Miller is defending.  What Mr. Miller has suggested and what probably Mr. Gold will suggest is to continue the same path of failure, the same negotiation that's failed to produce anything because of the imbalance.  What -- and that, in my opinion, is irresponsible towards Palestinians and irresponsible towards Israelis as well.  What they are proposing is to continue what Einstein described as insanity, which is doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results. [applause] Third, it also indicates, as I suspect Mr. Gold will show, such a position against UN admission indicates an underlying intention of rejecting the principle of having a Palestinian state, which means rejecting the right of the Palestinian people to be free. Continuing negotiations while settlements continue to grow is like having two sides negotiating over a piece of cheese.  One side, the Palestinian side, is stuck behind bars. The Israeli side having access to the piece of cheese and eating it while negotiating.  At the end of the day, we'll find nothing to negotiate about.  And that is not a solution.  So my second point is that in the light of the failure of the disability and inability of the United States for internal reasons that are well-known to you, and in the light of the weakness of the Europeans and their participation, and in the light of the stubbornness of the Israeli extreme right wing, we have to find a way for a new strategy. We have one of three options.  Either Palestinians would surrender to injustice, and that's what some people are calling for.  In this case, what you will witness is the consolidation of a system of apartheid, where Palestinians are discriminated against. And Israel would become the worst apartheid system in the 21st century, something that nobody could be proud about.  Or the second option is violence, which we reject, and we don't want.  The third option is to have nonviolence, peaceful resistance, exactly like Gandhi did in India, and like Martin Luther King did here in the United States.  And that's the course we are taking. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - And that's why going to the UN is nothing but another act of diplomatic resistance within the context of popular nonviolent resistance to change parameters and to change the balance of power so that we can have productive negotiations really and have a result at the end of the road.  My third point is that, supposing our right to be admitted to the United Nations will be sending the right message, the message of respect to human rights, the message of respect to people's right for self-determination, the message of respect of the right of people to be sovereign.  If we speak about the right of people in South Sudan and in Kosovo and in Libya and in Syria to be free and to have self-determination, then why not Palestine?  And why continue to use the double standard, especially that admitting Palestine in the UN would be about correcting a historical mistake that was made.  Since 1947 resolution the United States spoke about two states, Israel was established. Palestine was not.  My last point is that we know that admitting Palestine to the United Nations would not immediately create a change on the ground.  We understand, but it will achieve three goals.  First, it will give us hope.  It will give Palestinians hope.  Hope is what we need today to sustain a nonviolent approach to our resistance and struggle. Desperation and lack of hope as is advocated on the other side will only bring violence and dangerous things.  Second, accepting Palestine will actually invalidate all the de facto actions on the ground that are made by Israel and by creating settlements.  And, third, it will send a message to the Israelis that they will not be really free unless Palestinians are also free. We are now victims of oppression and discrimination.  The Israelis are hostage to occupation and fear, especially security fear.  And Mr. Gold will try to show you that there is more fear today because of the Arab Spring.  Instead of Israel being happy about people becoming democratic, they are having more fear.  This is not the right approach.  We want to liberate ourselves through popular nonviolent resistance through admission to the United Nations, but we also want to liberate the Israelis as well.  Martin Luther King liberated the United States, not only the African-Americans, from segregation as well as Mandela liberated the whole of South Africa, the whites and the blacks together by liberating South Africa from apartheid. And that's why what we want, what we are working for, is to liberate ourselves from oppression, the longest occupation in modern history, and the worst apartheid system, and to liberate the Israelis from fear, from the security phobia.  One time a Palestinian leader came to the United Nations with a gun and an olive branch.  Today we are Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - coming to the United Nations with two olive branches.  Don't let us drop them.  Thank you.\", \"But how are you recognizing the Palestinian state when you refuse to go back to '67 borders?\", 'The borders would be up in the air, or no borders?

In 19 -- he has -- he has been talking a lot, so let me [unintelligible]. [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - In 1947, it was decided there would be two states.  Israel would be on 54 percent of the land, Palestine on 44 percent of the land.  Now we are accepting 22 percent.  That's less than half of what we should have had according to the UN in '47.  And Mr. Gold wants to take away parts of that land because for the settlements that keep growing, Israel is the only country in the world that has not told anybody what are its borders.  Why?\", 'Because --', 'I think there are four issues for negotiation.  There is settlements, there is the borders, there is the issue of refugees, there is the issue of Jerusalem.  Nobody said that admitting us to the UN will mean that we will not negotiate about all these issues.', \"As one final point, please, it's very dangerous to say we admit, we accept Palestinian, that they should have a state, but we don't agree with '67 borders because what that means is that you want us to have a Bantustan like there was in South Africa.

This is a big achievement, and you should be happy about it.  If people change positively, you should not get angry, as Mr. Gold does.  Also, they are accepting 67 borders.  Thats an important change.', 'And when we --', 'When you speak about the Palestinian authority being incapable of controlling security, of course, because its under occupation.  We are the first people in the human history who are asked to provide protection to their occupiers without being able to defend themselves from the occupiers.  That makes no sense.

We are, but we cannot provide security to anybody and even to ourselves if we are not independent.

And I want to say here that if we are admitted to the UN, the most important thing that will come out is that the illegal actions of settlements which are destroying the possibility of a two-state solution would be invalid.  That means de facto creation of settlements on the ground does not undermine the right of the Palestinians to have a state.  That will be good for peace and for two-state solution.', \"It doesn't.\", 'The fact --', '-- on the ground will not become fact --', \"But before that, one second, please.  I didn't say that admission to the UN is the only factor that will change the balance.  I said this is part of a bigger thing which is popular, nonviolent resistance.

If you -- what Mr. Miller is reporting is just specifically a continuation of the status quo.  And we are saying this is dangerous, because today you have the whole Palestinian camp ready to accept nonviolence.

What you are describing -- what you are describing is something that is a long time disappeared.  And if we keep going back to the past, we will not find a way to the future. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 - You're asking why Israel  exchanged one prisoner for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, because Palestinians had only one prisoner. And, by the way, by the way, by the way, there are still 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.  Do you know how it feels -- do you know how it feels -- what is strange to me is why when the Oslo agreement was signed, not all of the Palestinian prisoners were released, why did it take Hamas to capture an Israeli soldier so that [unintelligible] spent 33 years in jail had to be released?  Why couldn't they be released?  Because of the peace agreement.  This is the mistake.\", 'Let me clarify one point here.  When Hamas won election, they got 44 percent of the votes and Fata got 41 percent.  It was the stupidity of Fatah, who did not accept full proportional system that led to Hamas getting a majority in the parliament.  Today I assure you there is a growing number of Palestinians that want to see a third alternative, which I think we represent.  And I do not think that either Hamas or Fatah will get an absolute majority in any future elections.  What you should encourage is that Palestine becomes a full state democracy with pluralism.  I always believed and I still believe that the only way to have a peaceful -- a lasting peace between both sides is if we have two democracies negotiating an agreement and not to have an agreement enforced from one side to another.', 'Thank you.  Mr. Gold has repeated practically what Weisglass, who was an advisor to Mr. Sharon when he said that we withdraw from Gaza so that we can put peace in formaldehyde.  We can put peace to sleep.  Unfortunately, creating fear is not a solution. And everything that Mr. Miller and Gold have suggested today is nothing but wasting time and using time.  And I am telling them, you can maybe afford to lose time because you haven\\'t lived for 44 years under occupation.  You haven\\'t lived in this position for a long time.  And you haven\\'t been humiliated every day by occupying forces.  You can maybe even afford to be sarcastic, gloomy, and even depressed. But that will not bring change.  Yes, the peace process has become a substitute to peace, and that\\'s why we need to change the situation.  I cannot afford to lose time because this is about my life, about my daughter\\'s life, and it\\'s about the lives of the Palestinians and Israelis.  And the Israelis themselves cannot afford it.  When I ask people, what do you want?  They say we want jobs, we want education, and we want health care.  We could not have had that -- we couldn\\'t have that because we have occupation.  And this needs to end. What the Israelis want is also security.  But that also cannot be available as long as Palestinians are insulted and humiliated.  Where Azizi in Tunisia created a revolution because he brought the issue of dignity to people\\'s minds. And every day, thousands of Palestinians dignity is harmed.  What we are trying to say to bring light in the end of the tunnel. When you vote today, don\\'t take away hope.  Don\\'t take away light at the end of the tunnel. And let me remind you here with what Plato said.  He said, We can easily forgive children for being afraid of dark.  The tragedy is when grown people are afraid of light.\"']\n",
      "[\"Well, doubt is okay.  Skepticism is healthy.  But we can't pretend the Palestinians away. And time isn't healing this.  So not acting to facilitate the Palestinian state is just a dereliction of responsibility to ourselves and to future generations.\", 'Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, on October 10, 1971, the United Nations admitted the People\\'s Republic of China as a member and kicked out Taiwan.  If that were the kind of motion we were debating tonight, I would not be standing here arguing in favor. What we are proposing is to admit Palestine at the U.N. not instead of Israel but alongside Israel, unfinished U.N. business from the middle of the last century.  Let me first clear up what I hope will not become debris in the way of constructive debate tonight.  We have not convened here to discuss matters of legal principle, \"Does Palestine meet the criteria of Montevideo for statehood?\"  Law matters, but this is Intelligence Squared U.S. - 6 - primarily a political, not a legal question.  And it\\'s not about the United Nations and whether it is a force for good or a frustrating institution.  It can be both, and Israel of course went to the U.N. to get its own birth certificate endorsed.  But the assumption of this debate is the two-state paradigm.  We do not have anyone here advocating a greater Jewish Israel or a binational democratic state, nevertheless, it would be hubris to take two states for granted, and we need to recognize certain realities. The territorial viability of a second state in this area looks increasingly precarious. Approximately 600,000 Israelis, one in 10 Israeli Jews live beyond the green line. Settlements grow.  Outposts are legalized.  I invite you to go and see the reality.  And it\\'s not just a physical manifestation of blurring.  It is also the conceptual universe in which a growing number of Israelis live.  Prime Minister Netanyahu may have talked the talk on two states, but he has not walked the walk.  His own Likud party platform opposes two states, and one must take seriously the Jewish-Israeli narrative that says 100 years ago we had nothing, then we got Balfour, then we got the \\'47 partition, then we got 78 percent of the land, then in 1967 we got 100 percent of the land, and we\\'re not going anywhere. That\\'s a serious view, and it has an amen corner, by the way, certain people perhaps in New Hampshire tonight\\'s part of that amen corner.  Passivity cannot be the response.  If we want two states, we have to act.  And U.N. admission for Palestine is precisely the anchor for a two-state future, a clarifying moment.  We need to be deeply respectful of the choices that Israelis are going to have to make, difficult choices, and the conversations in Israel, and, therefore, to understand just how unproductive the lack of clarity is for that Israeli conversation.  Indulging bad behavior, treating that with impunity, is unhelpful in any human predicament. And we encourage the most self destructive tendencies in Israeli behavior when we pretend that by doing nothing, allowing this slippage away from two states, somehow we\\'re making it easier for Israeli society to change course.  We are not.  The cost benefit calculation of Israelis needs to look different.  Do we really think that Israel is waiting to leave the territory, it\\'s just waiting, and the Palestinians just need to ask politely enough and behave well enough, and that\\'s the key to unlock this?  Let\\'s acknowledge that it\\'s not going to be easy but the current policies aren\\'t helping.  What, then, can be done? The Palestinians do actually have options, violence.  I\\'m against that.  That\\'s illegitimate. They can use nonviolence, coercive diplomacy of sanctioning.  I can see its legitimacy, but I\\'m not an advocate of that.  Or they can use declarative diplomacy, draw a line, lay down a marker to get the attention of Israelis. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - That\\'s what U.N. membership is, and I would argue it correlates with what is best, therefore, for Israel.  We can\\'t expect the Palestinians to wait forever, and we can\\'t say to them that you can neither have self-determination and express it at the U.N. but nor can you accept the one-state reality and argue for equal rights in one state.  Suggesting the Palestinians can do neither is unrealistic, but it\\'s also immoral.  So if we want to salvage a two-state solution but at the same time if we can\\'t impose a solution and if we can\\'t even prevent deterioration, if we can\\'t even get a settlement freeze, then how do we give oxygen to this gasping for breath two-state idea?  We vote to admit Palestine to the U.N. and we vote for this motion tonight.  U.N. membership is not a silver bullet.  Its not a panacea.  Its not sprinkling pixie dust on the harsh realities of the Middle East. But it is an important and legitimate part of a strategy to signal a different future.  We will no doubt be told that this cant happen, that its meaningless symbolism, and especially not now with the Arab spring.  Wrong.  Yes, the U.S. has committed to a veto. No doubt, well discuss that.  But does that make this debate pointless?  Can the realpolitik argument really close down our entire conversation?  If thats the case, I strongly suggest you guys cancel the debate you have planned in March about banning college football, because it wont be. And that can always be an argument.  I urge the other side of this debate to give us more than naysaying, to give us more than negotiations.  Those negotiations are asymmetrical. One side is so lacking in leverage and they are so steeped in years of failure.  Negotiations cannot be the singular tool in our toolkit. And finally, if we are concerned about Israels security, then lets acknowledge that hope too is a security currently.  Hopelessness encourages violence.  There will always be the next mountain range that you need to occupy, but strategic security is about a basket of interests and balances and avoiding casus belli.  And perhaps, perhaps, occupation itself contributes to insecurity and Israeli democracy.  Eventually managing an occupation and justifying it and sustaining democracy cannot happily coexist.  Not to dramatize, but if we dont have a Palestine, we are saying Kaddish.  We are saying the right of prayer, of last prayer for Israeli democracy.  I urge you to support this motion, to support the principle of Palestine alongside Israel at the U.N.  Thank you.', 'Sorry.  No one says that.  That was the initiative of the Israeli prime minister.', 'No one was telling him unilaterally -- [talking simultaneously]', \"Gaza is 6 percent of the land mass of the remaining 22 percent of mandatory Palestine that we're talking about in a two-state solution.

I want to address the two points you put out there.  First of all, what -- what we've tried to make the point of is that if you want a two-state solution, you have to do something about it, and you have to begin to anchor it, and you have to send signals.

Listen, for 40 plus years, the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belarus, and of Ukraine, were members of the U.N. Did that mean that they were independent states in the USSR?  Come on, this is a political act.  What we're talking about here is sending a political signal from the U.N. Your second point, the divided Palestinian authority.  First of all, Aaron, you didn't get it exactly right in your description of who takes -- who assumes that Palestinian seat at the U.N.  It's not the Palestinian authority, it's the PLO, and that has been clarified and made clear.  The PLO is still headed by Abbas.  The PLO has certain commitments that it has made in signed treaties.  And I would look at this as I try and look at most things, to be honest, as how do we use this opportunity?  How does this become an entry point to problem solving rather than rejecting it as another nonstop --\", 'I want to finish the point. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 - [applause]', 'My entry point for this is a problem solver is I would turn around and say, \"Palestine, you\\'re in the U.N., you sign the U.N. charter, read the words of the U.N. Charter. Hamas, you want reconciliation, you have to be signing up to the U.N. Charter as well.\"  I would make this part of the encouragement of internal Palestinian unity, to see the opportunity, not a way to threat. [applause]', \"I know this is an issue in which people, you know, kind of skate in and out, dont have very deeply held feelings. [laughter] I think its a shame that weve descended into a blame game here, and I want to try and pick up on the thread that I think Aaron was trying to reintroduce to the conversation. The Palestinians can take this by force. They can have it delivered to them by the international community.  And Im guessing where youre going with the third one is they can convince the Israelis to actually withdraw.  Or at least thats where I would go with it.  And if youre about to tell me that they can wait for America to deliver it for them, then I suggest you see a production of Waiting for Godot. [laughter] No, the point I want to make is that I think what the Israeli public needs to see right now, yes, theres a continued -- theres more of a Palestinian commitment and are continued by those who are already there, commitment to living alongside Israel, but I dont think a charm offensive is the entirety of the ingredients that we have to bring into the mix.  We have to bring in the ingredients which say to the Israelis, Hey, I hope were moving away from violence, but we cant sit on the sidelines while you swallow up all of Palestine.  So we're going to make declarative attempts. This does not mitigate against the fact that we want to live alongside you.  We're not trying to replace you at the UN.  But we do have to begin to accumulate some beginnings of a balance of leverage, some addressing of this asymmetry.  I think that's productive for any future Israeli-Palestinian process.\", \"Sorry, sorry.  So Avigdor Lieberman is some guy on the fringe of Israeli politics?

First, I really beg to differ with you on what looks different the morning after Palestine\\'s admitted to the UN. In the following way, and this isn\\'t just about Prime Minister Netanyahu and his coalition, but I do think that when Prime Minister Netanyahu can strut his stuff and say, \"You see, the international community doesn\\'t admit Palestine to the U.N.,\" I think that sends precisely the wrong signal to the Israeli public.  I give credit to the Israeli public intelligence in knowing the cost benefit calculation of the signals they\\'re receiving are not affirmative enough yet regarding two states, and I think it\\'s that signal that matters, and I do think it\\'s not going to change everything but it would change something in the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - discourse if Palestine is admitted to the U.N.  And that\\'s the kind of change that we need to begin to see happening.', \"Well, Israel signs agreements with the PLO or the agreements that Prime Minister Netanyahu signed that were referred to earlier, those are signed with the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization.  There's negotiation right now as to whether on the conditions under which Hamas and other bodies will join the PLO.  They're not in the PLO at the moment.  The PNC is in the PLO.  Every member of the Palestinian Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 - parliament, which means the gentleman sitting next to me is included in the PLO, that's who Israel --\", 'I think you -- Female Speaker: How many U.N. -- Daniel Levy: -- General Council with other U.N. bodies. Female Speaker: Okay, well, how many U.N. resolutions have -- Daniel Levy: There are 41 U.N. vetoes against resolutions in the Security Council. Female Speaker: Well, I wanted to know how many U.N. resolutions Israel has formally rejected against it and why, if it rejected those, it suddenly sees the viability of U.N. decisions in this case?', 'Yeah.  I mean, as Ive said, I think there are two ways of coming at this.  First of all, call me curmudgeonly pessimist, but I dont think the morning after Palestines admitted to the U.N., Israel is going to say, Ah, games up.  Were withdrawing to the 67 lines now. So, in practical terms, you know, I believe that this is about what signals do we send, even as an academic exercise.  So in practical terms, I think its a crucial question, but its not the morning after we all vote tonight or you all vote tonight or Palestine is admitted to the U.N. What I do think is -- and you know, lets be creative diplomatically here -- what I do think is you should be encouraging realistic terms for Palestinian reconciliation, for one authority with one gun.  And I think part of the blend of how you do that could be using the very admission of Palestine to the U.N., the very signing of that U.N. charter to hold Hamas to a certain standard on violence.

You've said it would undermine negotiations.  Negotiations have gone nowhere. You're the one who wrote that it was America acting as Israel's lawyer that undermined that very Camp David effort that you just reminded us about.  So come on.

The Muslim Brotherhood, political Islam, of which Hamas is a part, is kind of popular when people get the chance to vote democratically.  This is a reality we have to deal with. Now, we can bury our heads in the sand and say, there's a charter, and you have to stand up and publicly disavow X, Y or zed, or we can work, work day in, day out, to try and create a new reality that Hamas relates to, to try and create a new reality that the Muslim Brotherhood relates to, to work with this new reality in the Middle East.

I think the Palestinians should pursue this in a different way, and its going to take time, but theres a strategy for getting there.  Weve spoken a lot here about Hamas.

And I also dont like to hear the word apartheid.  Heres what the Israeli minister of defense, Ehud Barak, said in February 2010, The simple truth, there is one state including Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.  Its either bi-national or undemocratic.  That will be an apartheid state.  Thats the tragedy that we want to prevent. And you know what?  Our toolbox is an impoverished one because we have tried so much already.  But sticking exclusively with negotiations really must be the dumbest idea.  So what do we have left thats nonviolent.  Lets use the international tools of diplomacy that are at our disposal to make a statement.  We havent heard negative consequences that can come from this.  And mostly we havent heard what else to do except to blindly continue to place our faith in negotiations or that the Palestinians somehow should only be ingratiating themselves without creating any leverage with Israel and America.  Its been tried.  It hasnt worked.  The risk is the status quo.  The risk is the continued dissent of Israeli democracy to a place where it will be unrecognizable and an inability to reach a two-state solution.  We need to send a signal here from this room that Palestine should be admitted to the UN. And the UN needs to send a signal to Israelis and Palestinians that there's going to be a two-state solution, otherwise the next debate will be about equal rights in one indivisible territorial unit.  I'm not against equal rights in democracy, but I want an Israel, an Israel that's different, that changes.  But I want an Israel.  And I'm sure Mustafa wants a Palestine.

      "[\"My great-great-grandfather on my mother's side, yes.\", 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - Thank you.  I am not a professional like these guys, so I\\'m going to read my notes.  I apologize. Religion makes two big claims:  God really exists, and religion makes us behave better. But does religion make us behave better?  To partially answer that question, let me read you a verse or two from the Bible.  Deuteronomy, Chapter 25, Verses 11 and 12.  \"When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him and putteth forth a hand and taketh him by the secrets, then shalt thou cut off her hand.\"  Roughly translated, this means that if you\\'re in a fight, and your wife tries to help you by grabbing your opponent\\'s balls, you should chop her hand off. [laughter] It\\'s there.  I mean, I can show you.  I know it\\'s kind of cheap to poke fun at the Bible because it\\'s so easy, but -- [laughter] -- but there is -- there is a serious point here, which is that far from making us behave better, religion often complicates and distorts morality. By any reasonable standards, hacking bits off your wife is far worse than her squeezing your enemy\\'s nuts.  The thing is that in almost any holy book, you can find something that will validate just about anything.  And afterwards, you don\\'t have to defend the humanity of your actions or take responsibility because God told you to do it.  Believe it or not, there\\'s more atheism up here than faith.  A.C. Grayling and I are atheists.  David and Dinesh are too, except when it comes to their own religion.  Every other religion, they\\'re atheist about.  This is why religion is divisive.  Everyone on earth wants food, water, shelter, love, for their children to grow up to be happy and in a peaceful world. These common desires are so profound they ought to make war an absurdity, a violence against self.  Religion, however, makes everyone an infidel to someone. But we\\'re no longer ignorant, isolated tribes who think the earth is flat and don\\'t know what lies around the corner.  We have photographs of our planet from space.  And most of us have met people of many races.  We know our world and who we share it with. And we also know that critical worldwide problems will require worldwide unity.  In this context, religion\\'s continuing assistance, insistence that my God is better than yours is Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - disastrous, which leads me to credulity.  There are literally thousands of gods available. Which one you believe in is really just an accident of birth.  If David and Dinesh had been born in Afghanistan, they\\'d both be Muslim probably.  Or they\\'d be dead. [laughter] Like most people -- like most believers, however, they have faith in their inherited gods. They haven\\'t tested the rest because there\\'s far too many of them. How then do they know that their god exists and the other gods don\\'t or that their god is better than the other gods?  Because they\\'ve been told by an authority figure.  And here\\'s how he did it.  He said, our God is supreme, but he\\'s invisible.  We have no proof he exists.  But if you have faith, if you make a big effort to believe in him, you will believe in him.  It\\'s fantastic.  They take the weakest point of the argument and make it a condition of entry so you overlook it.  But if, in the most important area of your life, your philosophy no less, the first thing you learn as a child is that faith is absolutely essential, and evidence absolutely isn\\'t, how can this not affect the way you think about everything?  You\\'ve been brain washed to be credulous and submissive to authority. This affects many aspects of life, including the functioning of democracy and the understanding of science, both of which demand that you insist on evidence, question everything and take nothing on faith from anyone. Here\\'s an example.  Evolution through natural selection over billions of years is one of the best supported theories in science.  But 40 to 50 percent of Americans believe the earth is only six to 8,000 years old and that God made us as we are now.  Nearly 50 percent -- I mean, it\\'s really extraordinary.  It\\'s unheard of in any other culture except Muslim countries.  I\\'ve written widely on this subject and met creationists of all types. Often, they have -- I\\'d say usually they have no idea what evolution is.  But they dispute it with passion from a religious standpoint, faith over reason.  Evidence infuriates them, as does science itself.   And this antipathy to science has slowed down stem cell research, continues to harm the health of women and girls and contributes to cynicism about scientific issues like global warming. But none of this captures the human suffering caused by religion.  I grew up next to my gay uncle and his partner.  When I was nine, I discovered they faced long prison sentences if their homosexuality was revealed.  This was justified by Leviticus 20:13. And the verse was often quoted by both politicians and the clergy.  \"If a man lieth with a man as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination.  They Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - shall surely be put to death.\"  This barbaric verse is still used by Christians, including Catholics and evangelicals.  And violence is only its most obvious consequence. I end where I began.  Religion claims to provide morality.  But as can be seen in its divisiveness, its homophobia and in its almost universal subjugation of women, it just as often deforms morality.  The question isn\\'t whether religion can sometimes do good.  Of course it can and has. The question is, can we come up with something better that does not depend on dangerous and childish faith and thousands of competing gods?  Can we persuade people that it\\'s possible to live a good, peaceful and happy life guided only by human conscience and modern knowledge? When people who believe in martyrdom and an afterlife will soon get weapons of mass destruction, I think we have to, that we can and that we will.  And that\\'s why I ask you to support the motion that \"the world would be better off without religion.\"  Thank you.', \"Well, I just think it's a distortion of what you actually see in life, which is you see people who grow up in cultures.  They become addicted to their particular religions.  They disagree with all kinds of other religions.  Even you, you started as a Catholic.  You end up as an evangelical.  Does that mean that you then say the stuff in the Catholic part of it was actually wrong, and you were mistaken about that?  I think all of this is frankly delusional and that even if you could remove all of the bad things about religion and keep all of the good things in religion, none of which can't be performed by people who don't believe in God because they can.  But even if you could remove all of the bad things from religion, and you ended up with a character who is like Father Christmas, a nice harmless sort of person, would you want to find out that the president of the United States was a devout believer in Father Christmas? Not me.\", \"How can you be angry with somebody that doesn't exist?

His atheism didn't come solely from the fact that his daughter died.  It was a very slow process of seeing how the theory of evolution was in conflict with the Bible.  And I think the point I would make is, let's give the religious people that at some point in history, religion was helpful, that it did make people do better things.  But that the texts that the religions are based upon are archaic, absurd, cruel, open to interpretation.

They're saying we ignore their sophistication.  I'm saying they ignore the fact that most of the world is fundamentalist and takes a barbaric view of many of the text.\", \"Well, the harm is absolutely enormous, I mean, 50 percent -- I mean, just to be practical about it -- 50 percent of the growth of the American economy since World War II has come from science and technology.

But most people are religious, so its not surprising that most people who are out there doing good things are religious.  Its the same argument I would make about scientists.  Most scientists were Christians.  Well, most everybody was Christian.  So, of course, most of the scientists were Christians.', 'I dont think so.  Theres lots and lots of people who do good things and organize -- Dinesh DSouza: Ill challenge that on the basis of this book right here by the sociologist Arthur Brooks. Its called Who Really Cares?  And its the careful study of philanthropy in America.  So its comparing like with like. It divides America into four groups: religious conservatives, religious liberals, secular conservatives, and secular liberals.  And it looks at generosity, not just in terms of money, but also in terms of time, and not to religious causes but to so-called secular causes.  Turns out that the most charitable people in America, by far, are the religious conservatives.  The second most charitable are the religious liberals.  The third most charitable are the secular conservatives, and the last are the secular liberals.  Now, whats particularly poignant about this is the secular liberals in America are the richest. They earn the most money, but they give away the least.  So it is not the case that this is a generic matter of people who happen to be religious.  The point which David Sloan Wilson [spelled phonetically] made in a recent book is that evolution narrows the circle of our sympathies to our kin or to people from whom we can get something. But when you do things in service to God, youre much more likely to help the stranger or the outsider.', \"Well, I think the difference is that even the mistakes of people who are acting out of nonreligious motives are mistakes based on reason.  And that most of the horrors of religion are mistakes based out of superstitious fear and delusion.  And I cannot see how delusion can be healthy to a society.  I just can't -- I can't see it.  Not all of these religions can be true because they all contradict each other.  So some of them are delusional. How can this be healthy?  It's divisive.  It's nonsensical.

I\\'ve heard Rabbi Wolpe over there say that the whole process of religion is that you take all these complicated books, and you filter them through human consciousness and out comes something that makes sense.  I agree. And when you filter them out, what you get is humanism.  Jefferson did the same thing with the Bible.  He took out everything that he thought was contemptible or had nothing to do with the origins of religion.  He got 48 pages.

So you know I'm sure there's some diminution of religious attendants but I don't see a huge surge of atheism unfortunately.\", 'The world would be better off without religion because it is better off without religion. If religion made people behave better, markers of social dysfunction, drug addiction, ignorance, teen pregnancies, violent crime would be much lower in highly religious societies. In fact, the opposite is true.  To quote my friend, Austin Dacey, \"In post Christian Europe, entire nations have been plunked into endemic health, sky rocketing education and hopelessly low rates of violent crime.\"  This was a disadvantage to the English. And Intelligence Squared U.S. - 54 - I\\'m not-- I\\'m American.  Forgive me for using America by way of comparison.  I am an American.  I love America.  However, 90 percent of Americans believe in God.  But we have by far the largest prison population on earth.  Drug addiction is widespread.  Gun violence is grotesque.  Our education system produces kids whose math and science skills are far lower than in secular countries while our rate of teen pregnancy is far higher.  And in a country so rich and Christian, it\\'s amazing how many people live in abject poverty.  Religion is a rational, morally confusing and divisive.  It still exposes young children to the ghastly concept of hell.  It still denigrates women. It still fosters homophobia.  And \"religious\" gave us 9/11.  Making no reference to God, science has, among many other things, rid us of the plagues, smallpox and polio, dramatically reduced infant mortality, doubled the average length of a burdened life and is coming to understand how the brain works, including its capacity for empathy and moral decision making.  All this progress, all this beautiful knowledge, all this alleviation of human suffering in 100 years.  Religion has had thousands of years to prove its supernatural effectiveness.  It hasn\\'t.  We think it\\'s time to try a safer and more enlightened way.  So I hope you will support our position that the world will be better off without religion. [applause]']\n",
      "[\"Yes, it's true.  It's crazy.\", \"Yeah.  It's crazy, but it's true.\", 'Thank you. [applause] John, thank you very much indeed.  I must begin by asking you, if I may, to focus on what the proposition is before us.  We\\'re not here to discuss the existence of God.  We are not here to discuss whether it\\'s rational, irrational to have faith.  We\\'re here to discuss a sociological phenomenon, a man-made phenomenon, religion.  You can see the difference.  You might call in question whether or not gods and goddesses.  But you can\\'t call in question whether or not there is religion.  There\\'s plenty of it.  History is full of it, and it exists around us all the time today.  By the way, I say that religion is man- made advisedly. There are very few women indeed in the upper half of hierarchies of the world\\'s religions, which perhaps has something to do with the point. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - [laughter] Now, religions are very diverse in nature.  They have different interpretations of their deities. They say different things about what we can wear and what we can eat and when, how many wives we can have, what rituals we must follow.  Despite the fact that they all take the view that they\\'ve got the right story, they differ from one another quite dramatically in a number of respects.  And this is why, through the course of history, they\\'ve burdened mankind with a huge number of conflicts and a great deal of divisiveness.  But I\\'m not going to bore you by rehearsing the story of crusades and inquisitions and the rest.  It\\'s a very familiar matter. Although it is, of course, in the interests of apologists of religions to try to forget them.  Rather, I wanted to talk about things that religions have in common with one another rather than the things that divide them.  They have two things in common with one another. Most of the time in history, and among many of the orthodox manifestations of religion today, they are similar to one another in -- most of them, giving second-class status to women and being hostile to gays, in being very opposed to most kinds of progress, especially scientific progress.  The reason being, of course, that they take it that they received the truth a long time ago, anything between one and 3,000 years ago.  And so things that are challenging and are new and offer us different views of the world, they find unpalatable.  And so they tend to be very traditionalist, very conservative and rather retrogressive.  And that explains a great deal of the social policy and political endeavor that the religions engage in.  That\\'s one thing that they tend to have in common with one another. But another thing they have in common with one another, a very important point, is that they share a structural feature.  In fact, they are -- the religions are paradigmatic of a certain kind of organization, what I call a monolithic ideology, a one-size-fits all, top- down, totalizing ideology which says we\\'ve got the right story, and you\\'ve got to sign up for it. If you don\\'t sign up for our story, if you don\\'t agree, you are going to pay a sanction of one kind or another.  And during the course of history, those sanctions have sometimes been very terrible.  It\\'s in this respect in which religions in history and in their orthodox manifestations now, plus in all their manifestations, tend to share with other kinds of totalizing ideologies.  So that\\'s why it\\'s no great surprise that Joseph Stalin, for example, was educated in the seminary. What those totalitarianisms share is very, very common. [unintelligible] inquisition in Spain in the 15th century and Stalin\\'s Soviet Union in the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 6 - 20th century say the same thing, \"We\\'ve got the answer, you\\'ve got to agree, and if you don\\'t, you\\'re in trouble.\" So they have these two features, and the second of them, the structural feature, the idea of being in charge of the truth or of possessing the right story about life in the universe is very opposed to the enlightenment outlook on which our modern Western liberal democracies are based, the enlightenment of the 18th century taught us to think that there isn\\'t one right answer for everybody.  It taught us pluralism, taught us individual autonomy, it taught us liberty of conscience, it taught us democracy. Democracy is about people having a conversation, the great conversation of society in which we negotiate with one another about how we go forward, how we organize ourselves in society, and that\\'s very different indeed from thinking that there is one great ruler, one monarch, whether in the sky or on the ground, who tells us what we should do, and that we mustn\\'t think for ourselves, but we must all be orthodox, and indeed this ethical point is a very important one. There are those people who think that you can\\'t have religion -- you can\\'t have morality without religion, and of course, that isn\\'t true.  Everything good about religious morality, loving your neighbor, kindness, concern for others, responsibility as a member of the community, is shared by nonreligious ethical outlooks also.  They\\'re very common to all the great ethical theories.  I\\'m an atheist and a humanist, and those values matter deeply to me.  If you look at ancient Greek philosophy for example, a dominant strain of thought for nearly 1,000 years before Christianity came to command the mind of Europe, and you see that those values were shared by those thinkers, not because they thought they were told them by a deity but because reason and human experience had offered it to them.  And the final point is this.  People say, \"What\\'s wrong with moderate religion?\" you know, those nice folks who go to church on Sundays and who take part in their neighborhoods.  And here\\'s the problem with that, moderate religion is religion where people do a little bit of cherry picking. They take the best bits of the religion, and some of the more embarrassing, or difficult, or awkward, or rebarbative bits they leave to one side.   I know very, very few Christians who give away all they own to the poor, who take no thought for tomorrow, who turn their backs on their families if their families disagree and families are going to disagree if they do give away everything, who don\\'t marry, who stay celibate.  I find very few Christians actually live the New Testament morality, they cherry pick.  Unkind people would call that \"hypocrisy.\"  At the other end of the scale, however, are those who take their religion extremely seriously, the extremists, we call it them.  The point about the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - extremists is that they are the most honest of the people who have a religious view because they commit themselves to what their tradition tells them, and they stay closest to the text.  Now, if that\\'s real religion, that\\'s honest religion, the world is very much better off without it. And if the world is much better off without the true and the honest form of religion, why not put the hypocrites in with them, too?  Thank you. [laughter] [applause]', 'Well, first, of course, Matthew is right to point out that the religion that anybody has, tends, on the whole -- in much more than 95 percent of cases to be the religion of your parents.

People are brought up in the religion of their father, and its historical.', 'But you asked me the question.', 'Okay, so I repeat the answer, which is, of course, religion is pervasive in history at its traditional -- its handed down from parents to their children so it remains the case that its a very potent force in society.  But if you look at the trend in the developed and advanced and educated countries of the world, mainly the Western countries, since the 17th and 18th century, enlightenment and the growth of science, you see the numbers are plummeting.  They are plummeting even here in the United States of America.  You look at the few polling data and it points out to us that the number of people who self- identify as not having a religious commitment or agnostic or atheist is increasing all the time, especially among the young.  So the trends are setting in the right direction.', \"Can I come back to that?  I hear a certain kind of incoherence on the other side there.

[laughter] I'm afraid the things that most people are brought up in a religious tradition, and those people who escape religion do it because they look at the facts, they look at the evidence, they look at the morality.  They look at the teachings.  They look at the world around them, and they recognize that there is something very divisive and very distorting here.  Look at small children even in kindergarten, all races and ethnicities and backgrounds and classes and religions.  They don't know that.  We have to work very, very hard to divide them and tell them what tribe they belong to and what religion they belong to.  And that's where the source of the trouble comes in our world --\", '-- from division.', \"Yeah, sorry, I mean there are two things, Dinesh, with great respect to you, you are the most tremendous rewriter of history I've ever come across in my life. [laughter] [applause] You don't seem to be conscious of the fact that when Christianity became dominant in Europe in about the third, fourth century A.D. it looked at its sundial, the perusing [spelled phonetically] of the second coming of the Messiah hadn't happened, they needed some extra ethics.  The ethics of the New Testament and the Napoleon epistles are very thin, they're the stuff I talked about earlier, give everything away, don't get married, don't bother about tomorrow.  Where did they get it from?  They got it from Greek philosophy.  Most of European culture, and that means culture of the West, is deeply rooted in classical antiquity, in the thinking of Socrates, and Aristotle, and the stoics.  That is where our European outlook -- our cultural outlook comes from. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 - Conceptions of justice, of ethics, of a democracy, they all come from the pre-Christian state of Europe. Christianity was an oriental religion that erupted into Europe and changed the course of European history, and derailed it for over 1,000 years.  People couldn't build a dome like the Dome of Maxentius in Rome because they'd lost the understanding of simple engineering. Wasn't until Brunelleschi's Dome in Florence in the 15 -- 16th century that that was possible.  So we're looking at a phenomenon here where religion did to our forefathers, did to the history of our culture exactly what Matthew says it's doing again to the prospects for science and progress in our contemporary world.\", 'Can I tell David just a quick little anecdote about a conversation I had with a cab driver in London.  Cab drivers in London are very interesting folk. [laughter] I asked this man if hed read the Old Testament.  He said he hadnt.  I said, Do you remember any stories from the Old Testament.

They dont want a return for their investment.  George Bernard Shaw said -- very, very quick quote -- he said when he gave up religion -- escaped religion as a teenager, he said that moment was the moment when I felt the dawning of moral passion because people who dont take a box out of the frozen food warehouse of morality, you know, there it all is, are people who have go to think about their responsibilities and about their relationships to other people.  They\\'ve got to be people who think about the diversity, how different people are from one another.  You know the golden rule, \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\" George Bernard Shaw said, no, under no circumstances should you do to others what you\\'d like them to do to you because they may not like it. And that\\'s a very good insight.  It means see them for what they are in their individuality and personality and base your morality on a genuine understanding of what it is to be human in a human world.', 'Yeah, I think the response is that you have to notice that most of the advance countries of the world are secular constitutionally, like this one, or functionally secular like my own United Kingdom.  And the point about those societies is that they organize welfare, education, defense, infrastructure, and they do this not in the name of one or another religion but in the name of society generally.  So when you look at the benefits, you look at the rational application of our ideas about how a society should flourish and advance and what the needs are of the members of that society, the post-enlightenment world, the world since the 18th century, the world which has been putting to work the ideas of scientific rationality has made a vast improvement to the lives of most individual people.

Theyre given the most updated version of it, and so on.  So its not about attacking individuals.  Its about attacking ideas.  Its about attacking ideologies.

In fact, what's happened since 9/11 when the very violent religious activism brought religion back into everybody's point of focus again, is that the volume has gone up. People think that religion is resurging but actually it's because the volume has gone up Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - in the debate.  Literally thousands, literally thousands of books of a religious nature are published every year in the United States of America and in Britain.  You don't have to walk into a Barnes and Noble to see shelf after shelf of them.  About half a dozen books which are by Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett, about half a dozen books have been published attacking religion and putting the atheist case, and all hell breaks loose.  But by the way hell was sufficiently banned by the Episcopalian church -- [laughter] -- back in the 1920s.  I don't know whether you know this but they're trying to reinvent themselves, but anyway it broke loose because half a dozen books had come out attacking the religious standpoint.  And what had happened was this, before 9/11 religion went sort of by default. If I met a religious person, I would you know pussyfoot around, few eggshells. Somebody once said, you meet a Christian, it's like meeting somebody who's had a recent death in the family, which is a bit sort of apropos.

Weve got to do that hard work of choosing our morality, choosing our ethics, thinking about the principles of which we live, not borrowing it, not inheriting it, not having to conform to a set of doctrines about these things and a set of rituals which people very, very, very long time ago depended upon to do their thinking for them, but to think afresh, start again, and look at this world as a place where reason and human experience have to be our best, because they are in fact our only guides.']\n",

      "[\"Actually, there is a fourth PhD, my sister who is also a professor at Princeton, actually. But she's in anthropology.  So Dan Hamermesh who is a professor of economics at Texas, says, let me think.  Your father was a theoretical physicist.  Your brother's an experimental physicist. You're an economist, and your sister's an anthropologist.  You're getting weaker as you go. [laughter]\", \"Thank you.  It really is a pleasure to be here tonight.  And, you know, Dan really said it right when you said you have five economists, you really only get nine opinions.  I think you get many more.  I was in the Clinton administration.  Those were good years in the '90s.  I think many people might interpret those times, though as that the Federal Reserve, because we were having a lot of economic growth, and the Federal Reserve was not anywhere near having interest rates which were so near to zero, that monetary policy -- the Federal Reserve was actually responsible for a lot of that growth. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - In contrast, what we have today is, specifically, a Fed that cannot do as much as it normally can in normal times.  Interest rates are near zero.  It's near zero, lower bound. You can't have negative interest rates, and therefore it's an opportune time to have more fiscal policy.  But my debate partner talked about some of these bigger pictures. I'm a labor economist.  I got into economics because I was worried about the unemployed, and I still am.  There are 14 million workers in the United States who are unemployed.  Half of them have been unemployed for more than six months.  There are another two and a half million who are discouraged, meaning that they've even given up looking.  And there's about nine million who are working part time, but who would actually like to work full time.  So they're working part time for economic reasons. We've had 19 straight months of private sector employment growth.  But we've also had many months where the public sector has had negative employment growth. And as a result, we have a recovery, but it's a recovery with a small R.  It's just fledgling. And as Mark pointed out I'm also very concerned that this recovery is just not far enough along. Now, there're huge challenges that this entire downturn is going to pose for us going forward. When workers become displaced, they do not earn -- they have, going forward, for 15, 20 years, they're going to earn much less, by some estimates, 10 to 15, 20 percent less than they were earning before their displacement.  It has impact on their children.  Their children get lower levels of schooling going forward.  It is going to affect the earnings of their children.  And look at all of the young people today who are finishing their schooling and can't get a job, meaning they're not even getting started into the labor force.  So we know that these have the potential to really hold back economic growth going forward.  So yes, I support the Obama plan. I support any plan where it's going to provide some sort of short-term insurance against another double-dip recession or having more downturn. Now look, last year, I was at the Council of Economic Advisors.  And things were looking a lot better.  And as a result, if you listened to the president's State of the Union, what he proposed in his budget were investments that were not towards stimulus, but were really towards the foundations of growth, in infrastructure and education, in innovation. And I believe that they are very important.  And we all believe that.  But we don't have the economy today that we had just six, nine months ago.  And therefore, I think the time is right for Congress to act.  Now, let's first talk about the pillars of what -- the major components of this plan and what it would do.  So first of all, about 40 percent of it is putting money in the hands of individuals.  Okay.  Some people may say, well, look, that's putting money in their pockets. They're not doing much.  But let's talk about it.  So the tax cut was providing about $1,500 a year in tax cuts for those who are earned about $50,000 a year, which is about what the median family earns, I should say. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - It was about $2,500 for those earning $80,000 or more.  It continues the federally funded unemployment insurance benefits.  Now, let's talk about that.  Six million workers will lose those unemployment insurance benefits.  They lost their job through no fault of their own.  These benefits are not helping them live high on the hog.  It's only replacing about half of their wages, which means they're getting a check of about $320 a week.  And we know that that's about a third of the family income.  It helps them to pay their mortgage or pay their rent, helps them put food on the table.  It helps them to support their local businesses, et cetera.  And that's the way in which it helps to support the economy.  The Congressional Budget Office has said that these sorts of benefits are one of the fastest and most effective ways in which to help our economy in the short term.  Important we can talk more about this.  I know many believe that this is not the time to continue -- to continue these sorts of benefits.  And I would argue this is exactly the time to do so.  It also -- let's face it, the private sector is the most important source of job growth in this country.  They provide 80 percent of the jobs. So another part of this is -- this is not about trying to create a gigantic public sector jobs program.  It's about trying to stand up the private sector.  So another 20 percent or so are ways to try to cut the cost for businesses to do their business.  So I teach microeconomics.  Firms do business by having labor and capital.  I hope that's as geeky as I get tonight.  And there are ways to cut their investments for next year and as well as lowering costs of hiring workers.  Again, it extends the payroll tax cut not just to the employee but to the employer now. And it also provides an extra incentive for firms to bring on more workers.  And lastly, as I mentioned before -- all of those should help in the next year.  But we know we're going to be in this for a little while.  It takes a while to recover from downturns that are caused by crises in the financial sector.  And so 20 percent of it is also directed towards infrastructure, which again we think is actually one of the pillars of economic growth.  Now, as Mark mentioned, there are some innovations in the way some of this money would be spent. In terms of the unemployment insurance benefit, there are some encouraging states to provide more employment, reemployment assistance to workers.  There is encouraging states to stand up programs where firms don't have to choose between laying off workers and keeping some-- they can share the pain, if you will, for a temporary downturn, through work sharing.  It encourages entrepreneurship by encouraging states, some of which already have them, including my own state of New Jersey -- help making it easier for aspiring entrepreneurs who are unemployed to be able to start their business while they're receiving these unemployment insurance benefits which they Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - currently are not technically allowed to do.  And it also starts an infrastructure bank which is a creative way of trying to bring private money into trying to foster some of these public projects for which normally the private sector doesn't receive enough of a return in order to do. So I think that it's a balanced package, and I think it hits a lot of the right parts.  As Mark mentioned, it's paid for.  We can talk more about the way it's paid for. You know, the current idea on the table is Senator Reid proposing a 5.6 percent tax on those whose adjusted gross income is more than a million dollars, that's about .03 percent of American taxpayers.  So, in closing, yes, I support a program that will provide support to this economy today because I am very worried about how families are getting by.  We have 46 million families living in poverty.  I'm worried that our recovery is fragile.  This doesn't mean that we don't need longer term strategies to have more robust growth going forward, but I just don't happen to believe that these aren't mutually exclusive.  Maybe hope springs eternal, but I think that Congress can walk and chew gum at the same time, thank you.\", \"Yeah, that wasn't the CBO.\", \"Well, you know, there is a theory in public finance that says that you shouldn't have a very high marginal tax rate on the very highest earners.  But if you actually look at the -- in our experience over time, there's not a great relationship between the highest marginal tax rates and how we're doing in terms of economic growth.  If you look at Reagan, he lowered tax rates for high income individuals.  Clinton increased them.  And you saw somewhat greater economic growth under Clinton than under Reagan. So I think the evidence tells us that, yes, there is -- these are tax rates.  So I'm not going to say that there's no impact at all in terms of lowering economic growth, et cetera.  But it's very small for the highest earners because they don't spend the tax cuts.  And it doesn't have that big of an impact on their earnings.  You know, some have looked at what some of the highest paid CEOs did with their tax cuts.  Some of them, it's true. They exercised stock options creatively and strategically. But in terms of their general income, which is really the income-generating activity, there was really no impact.  So I actually think that this is -- I think it's a small tax increase today, but -- not today, it's in a couple of years, and that it'll be at a time when the economy can actually sustain it.\", \"That -- okay.  So that wasn't the White House.  That was a transition paper by Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein.\", 'But you have to remember --', \"No.  We weren't at the CEA at that point.  But here is --\", \"Okay.  So here is the point about that number, though, right?  There's always a counter factual. And as it turned out, they generated that estimate based on what they knew at the time which was in December 2008.  As it turned out, the economy was a lot sicker than what they even knew.\", 'It was.  Exactly.', \"No.  I actually don't want to speak to this specific point, but I -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 -\", \"Yeah, you know, first of all -- look, I'm not a regulatory law expert, but my understanding is at least some of the provisions, such as the buy American provisions and the Davis Bacon, applied to infrastructure projects without this bill, meaning they've been in statute for decades since the 1930s as you mentioned --\", 'Well -- but that would mean that in order for this bill to get rid of them, that would be something new in this bill.  And so we could argue about the merits or not, but really all this bill is doing is making it consistent with current law.', \"The agencies know how to administrate them, it doesn't add an additional administrative burden, but like I said, we could argue the merits of it, but I think that, that's not really the main purpose of the bill.\", 'The point that I was going to bring up earlier was more about how do we judge the value of stimulus and of the Recovery Act. And I really just wanted to say, \"Look, as Richard pointed out, the problem here is that we\\'re trying to argue about a counterfactual, but I\\'m really sympathetic to --\"', 'About a counterfactual meaning.  Okay we passed the stimulus.  And the way we will judge whether a policy is effective, we say what would have happened had we not done so.  So we passed it.  I dont yet have a time machine.  President doesnt have a time machine, so we cant go back and unpass it and see what would have happened had we not passed it.  Therefore what economists have to do is try to say, try to create that counterfactual, what would have happened in its absence.  Okay, Im very sympathetic to the Keynesian multipliers, just sort of mindlessly applying the multiplier and saying what would happen.', 'Which means that economists have estimated okay, if we spend this much on infrastructure spending, then its going to chug through the economy and were going to get this much out and its going to create this much employment.  And thats their way of doing a counterfactual in a sense.  Im a micro-economist.  My job is, I do a lot in education, its to do a lot of evaluation of programs, so that doesnt make sense to me. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 - But what does make sense to me, is that therere some economists that have not taken that route but have said instead, well can we compare the outgrowth of, or the employment growth in states where theyve got more money, or in localities where they got more money than in others. Now, you might worry that okay, well but why did some get more money than others. Maybe you got more money because you were doing more poorly.  Theyve tried to adjust for that in very creative and credible ways I might add.  And this is not by economists that were working for the Obama administration or really had a dog in the hunt.  And what they find is, it was actually fairly positive as well. So Im fairly convinced that not just with one methodology do we find that the stimulus made a difference, but using a variety of them.  Will we ever know for sure?  No.  I can see that because I think thats what my business --we have to be humble about that.', 'Can I just make one point?', 'Sure.', 'I just wanted to thank Dan for bringing up Germany and Canada.  Because, one of the reasons why many people believe that, especially Germany, which had a larger, or Germany did not suffer the same employment losses that we did and many people have asked why. And Canada as well, and both of them have work sharing programs, which were very active.  So many people believe, and again if you ask German economists what exactly explains it, youll get many answers.  But one of the reasons is because German employers were not obligated to try to adjust to the downturn by laying off all of their workers.  Thats a lot of the reason why the president actually was looking to Germany and weve been trying to expand our own work sharing program for exactly this reason.', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 34 - Yeah, please.', 'I just wanted to say something about the anti-discrimination provision.', 'To say what it is.', 'I was going to do that.  So many employers have actually been having their ads, when they post for employment, they say, \"if you are unemployed, you need not apply.\"  We\\'ll not consider -- or you must currently have a job. So many employers have this in statute -- or not in statute, but they have that in their ads.  And as a result, many people are concerned that this is not particularly conducive to employment growth.  So, I understand that employers are being inundated with applications and with applicants.  There are over four unemployed workers for every job opening.  And employers are having to find ways to really sift through.  And I also understand that we want to let employers hire who they need to hire, who they think is the best match.  But let\\'s think of some of the negative spillovers of these ads to the rest of society, which is where I think we have a place for government intervention.  First of all, imagine you\\'re an unemployed worker.  Especially imagine you\\'re an unemployed worker who\\'s been unemployed for at least six months.  So you\\'re actually bordering on discouraged.  I actually know of a single mother who has been on welfare and is -- you know, marginally thinks she\\'s not very attractive to employers.  You understand that employers are putting out these ads, you don\\'t even try to get a job. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - And the worst thing we want to do right now is to discourage workers from even trying, from even applying for jobs.  So one is I think it discourages workers from even trying to get hired. The second negative spillover is that in our economy one of the ways in which young people in particular have job growth early in their career is by quitting jobs.  We have a lot of dynamism in our labor market, and one of the problems we have right now is actually because of the labor market, we have fewer quits than we normally would have, and as a result, workers are staying in jobs, they\\'re not quitting, and so they\\'re not going to be climbing up the career ladder.  It\\'s a negative spillover to the rest of society.', 'So I just wanted to come back to that for just a moment because this law, what this proposes is not saying that employers have to hire a specific person. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 - What it says is one, you cant put it in the ad.  Okay that is true, that is a restriction.  You cant put in the ad that you will not look at an unemployed person.  And two it says that there cant be a blanket policy, so there cant be a memo.  So what is -- let me say, its a largely symbolic gesture.  The Obama administration caps damages at a thousand dollars if you actually put something in an ad.  It caps it at $5,000 if you can come up with, if the EEOC, Equal Opportunity Employment Commission can actually come up with a memo documenting it.  So its not, its meant to say look, we need for, at least, there not to be overt discrimination against those who are unemployed so we dont discourage workers from trying to apply to a job.', \"Look, it really is meant to -- Governor Christie in my fair state, our Governor Christie passed a law that was similar.  Im not saying that makes it okay.  But what Im saying is that, it really is a problem if unemployed workers are discouraged from applying for jobs.  And it's really just saying employers try to make -- [talking simultaneously]\", \"Well, look, I think that there was a lot of good fiscal policy that happened under the Clinton administration as well.  So I'm not going to agree with your premise that it was only the monetary policy and that there was no fiscal policy under Clinton.  Now, was it necessarily fiscal policy in terms of stimulus as Dan has mentioned? There was a lot of other--there was NAFTA.  There were other attempts to stimulate economic growth.  But --\", 'Exactly.', \"So I do believe that Congress should pass the Obama jobs plan.  I too am concerned about the impact of employer mandates on labor markets and believe we should be very judicious in looking at regulation.  I think we should only put into place regulations where the benefits clearly exceed the costs.  I think the evidence isn't really there that minimum wage is such an egregious regulation.  But that would be another debate. However, if the Clinton administration in the Clinton years were such an example of economic freedom, in 2001, we had a recession where we had a jobless recovery.  So what happened?  Did the regulatory environment magically change with an election? I think that what we have is -- what that tells us is that this regulatory environment is not going to address the cyclical changes.  And I think we have a cyclical challenge right now.  And so I think it's appropriate for the Congress to step in.  Now, as I said from the outset, I think one of the most important pieces of this is one that's a tax relief for employees.  I think continuing the federally funded unemployment insurance benefit is very important as well. I just want to add to that that Congress has always extended these benefits during times of recession.  And the reason is clear.  It's pennywise and pound foolish not to do so.  If workers and their families aren't supported, they're going to end up on other government programs.  And so Congress -- even Reagan did not stop supporting unemployment insurance benefits until employment had fallen below 7.5 percent.  So I think Congress typically steps in during times of recession.  I think there are good economic reasons for it to do so.  And I think this is one of those times.  More importantly, you know, as Mark has said very carefully, we really do risk falling into another recession which will be just devastating for all of us. Might doing nothing make a difference?  It might work.  But I've got to tell you, I'm not a gambling girl, and I'm just not willing to make that gamble for 42 million workers who are out of work and the millions more who are really suffering economically.  Thank you.\"]\n",
      "['Well, I must be right then.', \"Thank you. [applause] Thank you, John, thank you Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to be here.  And it is certainly an honor to be here with such a thoughtful group of individuals.  It's an honor to be here.  I'm going to make four points in my opening remarks.  Point number one is that I think there are a number of different reasons for why the Obama jobs plan should be passed.  I'm not going to go through all of them.  Cece's going to go through some of her reasoning.  But for me the key thing is we need to avoid going back into a recession.  And the jobs plan is instrumental in ensuring that we don't.  The economy is obviously struggling.  This is very obvious by looking at the job market. If you take a look at the jobs data over the last few months, we've been getting job growth that's close to 75,000 per month on average.  Just for context, we need almost double that to maintain a stable rate of unemployment.  And unemployment is already 9.1 percent and thus threatens to higher.  This is a rather dramatic reversal of fortune Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - from where we were at the start of the year. I mean, it's hard to remember back, but just think about January, February, March, April.  We were creating a couple hundred thousand jobs per month.  And I was quite optimistic about the economy's prospects. But we got nailed by a number of what I call unfortunate events.  In fact, John, I say they're unpredictable, largely because I didn't predict them. [laughter] Higher energy prices due in part to the Arab Spring and the Libyan conflict, and even with the declining energy prices more recently, we're going to spend about a hundred, 125 billion more on gasoline this year than last. And by the way, that's roughly equal to the payroll tax holiday that we got this year.  So we literally took our tax cut, and we put it into our gas tank.  It didn't provide the juice that we were hoping for, but I think it forced all the recession, very helpful.  The Japanese quake, very hard on manufacturing, which has been a key source of growth. But I think the key thing that did us in this year was a series of what I consider very egregious policy errors.  Most obvious being the spectacle over the debt ceiling debate. I think that just completely eviscerated confidence, undermined sentiment.  It's not that people are pulling back yet.  It's not that businesses are increasing their layoffs.  But they certainly have stopped hiring, and that's why we're in the predicament that we're in.  I do think that if policy makers do nothing, just sit on their hands and do nothing, the odds of recession are very serious.  In fact, I think they're better than even. Because in current policy, under current law, there is significant fiscal restraint, meaning that given some of the tax cuts that expire, given some of the spending increases that fade away, a federal fiscal policy will cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth.  GDP is the value of all the things that we produce.  They'll cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth next year, and if you throw in the cuts at state and local government, it's almost a couple percentage points.  The good economy, a solid economy that's growing strongly would have trouble digesting that kind of restraint.  A weak economy, the economy that we're in today, I think would be pushed into recession.  So we've got to make some policy changes to ensure that, that fiscal drag is less significant than it is currently.  Point number two, I think the fiscal stimulus that has been implemented to date has been effective.  I think it succeeded.  The purpose of physical stimulus is not to provide a source of long term economic growth. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 6 - It's about ending the recession.  In fact, the Recovery Act -- this is the stimulus that most people are focused on, the $850 billion package that was implemented at the start of the Obama administration, succeeded in ending the great recession just-- a few days. The Recovery Act was passed in mid-late February '09.  And by the way, in February '09 we lost 750,000 jobs.  The economy was in freefall.  By June the economy was growing again, GDP, again, the value of all the things that we produce was increasing, the recession was over by February 2010, one year later.  We were creating jobs.  And over the past year and a half since February 2010, we've created well over two million jobs. It's not good enough but in the -- I think the counterfactual is here -- here is a much more serious recession.  In my view, we would've suffered a depression. The stimulus efforts were very successful in ending the great recession, jump starting an economic recovery.  Third point -- did I tell you how many points I was going to make? Audience: Four. Mark Zandi: Four.  The third point -- just testing, making sure you're paying attention -- [laughter] -- third point is that the Obama plan is pretty well structured, 450 billion over two years, 250 billion of which approximately are temporary tax cuts, another 200 billion in temporary spending increases.  You know, not all of the pieces of the package are made equal.  In my view, the most important element of the plan is the extension of the payroll tax holiday for workers.  If we do not extend that, taxes for everyone will rise on January 1, 2012, and again, given this economy, that would be a very significant problem.  There are elements of the plan that are really quite creative, some of which Cece has worked on with respect to providing incentives for employers to go out and hire people. There are reforms to the unemployment insurance system that I think has wide bipartisan support, and there's some really creative elements with respect to infrastructure spending and infrastructure banks to try to get private capital married with public money to go out and invest in our much depleted infrastructure, and the most important thing you should know, it is all paid for.  This is not a deficit of finance. It will be paid for by -- at this point, the discussion is to have a tax surcharge on people who make a million dollars a year.  Now, that's a negative.  I don't like raising taxes on anybody, but I think that's a modest negative in the context of, again, not going back Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - into recession.  And finally, point number four, this is very important, the jobs bill is only one part of what policymakers need to do to get this economy on the right track.  We also need long term economic policy, but we have -- Congress and the administrative have to follow through on the debt ceiling deal, and we need tax reform. So we need to reduce the tax expenditures in the tax code, make it fairer, less complex, and put our businesses on solid ground.  So this is only the start of what we need to do. It's not the end.  I want to thank you very much for your kind attention.  We just can't go back into recession.  Obama's job plan will ensure that we don't.  Thank you.\", \"Well, I don't think that's true.  I think fiscal stimulus is a tried and true policy response to recession.  Since every recession since World War II, we've had fiscal stimulus.  In fact, the degree of fiscal stimulus provided is commensurate with the severity of the recession, at least as measured by the unemployment rate.  And in fact, one could argue that the fiscal stimulus that was provided in this recession, the great recession, was inadequate. It was not proportional to the severity of the recession.  And that's one of the reasons why the economy hasn't engaged to the degree that I think most would have thought at this point. Moreover, I'm not alone in this view.  Cece brought up the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO is a nonpartisan group respected by both Republicans and Democrats.  They score the various proposals made by policy makers, tax policy and spending policy.  And they do studies of various stimulus packages.  And they released the estimates on the impact on GDP, on jobs, unemployment on a regular basis and they show consistently that they believe that this had been --\", '-- a plus to the economy.', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 20 - [unintelligible] percent unemployment.  That wasn't the CBO.\", \"I cant counter-factual.  I mean, we can't prove the counter-factual.\", \"Well, I tried to make my case with respect to timing.  I mean, that's more obvious, right? So February '09, the stimulus, the one that we're focused on, most people are focused on, passed.  It was mid February '09, I believe.  In February '09, we lost literally 750,000 jobs.  We lost 750,000 jobs in January, we lost 750,000 job in March.  The economy was shrinking rapidly. We were in a free fall.  By June, the recession was over, not by my Intelligence Squared U.S. - 23 - definition, by the National Bureau for Economic Research.  By one year later, we were having job growth.  So, okay, you could argue maybe the economy magically would have found its footing without help from the federal government.  And I'm not saying stimulus was the only thing.  There were many policy responses.  There was the Federal Reserve.  There were the TARP programs.  There were lots of different things.\", \"But I think it's fair to say, just given the chronology of events, that the stimulus had a very positive impact. The economy would have performed measurably worse.\", 'Okay, can I respond?', \"I concur.  I concur.  I agree with you entirely that the stimulus efforts are not a source of long-term growth.  They are not.  They were never intended to be.  They were to provide support to the economy in a time of crisis, when we were in free fall.  But we Intelligence Squared U.S. - 24 - also need policies, like the ones you're talking about.  And we can discuss the merits of it, where we need to focus on regulatory policy.  We need to focus on tax policy. And most importantly of all, we need to focus on our long-term fiscal\", 'That\\'s exactly what it is.  If you had asked me to come to this debate six months ago when the economy was -- we were creating a couple hundred thousand jobs a month, I\\'d say, \"John, I\\'m not coming.\"', \"But I -- you know, and I'm not a hard -- Keynesian theory works at specific points in time. It's not an immutable fact.  It doesn't work in every environment.\", 'This is an environment where --', \"Well, you mean -- okay.  You're going to drag me into the 1950s?\", \"Okay, all right, okay, fair enough.  I don't agree with that interpretation --\", \"The 1950s were actually a pretty difficult period.  Now, I'm not arguing that stimulus would've been the right  that big public works project would've been the right response to that, but, you know, the '50s weren't the greatest decade.  It was --\", \"Well, you said after the recession -- I mean, after the war, World War II ended in 1945, and then that period -- then we had the Korean War which was a lot of fiscal stimulus, and then the 1950s was a period of really no growth.  In fact, we had three recessions in the 1950s, and it was a very difficult time.  So I don't know, maybe.  That's stretching the limits of my historical experience, but -- and I know in our recent history, stimuluses work quite well, and in the most recent period, it's been highly successful.\", \"Hi, Gene.  How are you?  Good to see you.  I recognize the voice.  Yeah.  We haven't talked in a while. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - [laughter] Please give me a call, Gene.  Yeah. Gene Epstein: You don't return my calls, Zandi. Mark Zandi: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I return everybody's call.  I think I would do both.  I think Cece said it nicely.  You know, policy makers can walk and chew gum at the same time.  And we need to do that.  I do sympathize with a lot of the points that are being made with respect to regulatory policy and government intervention.  I do think some of the policy steps have created uncertainty for businesses and for the banking system.  And that's impaired the ability and willingness of businesses to step up and hire and for banks to lend.  So I sympathize with that perspective.  And I think we need to work on policies to address that.  But that does not preclude the fact that we need to reduce some of the fiscal restraint that's dead ahead of us.  If we don't make some policy steps here, taxes are going to rise on everybody.  Unemployment insurance for many hard-pressed households are going to expire.  And that's the prescription for a recession.\", 'Can I --', \"Here's the -- this is what I worry about.  I think our economy has made significant progress in righting the wrongs that got us into this mess.  We've reduced debt.  The businesses are in very good shape financially.  Households have made a lot of progress. There's work to be done. We've got foreclosure issues.  The banking system is recapitalized.  We've made significant progress.  We're on the verge of a much better economy.  But if we go back into recession, all that good, hard work is going to go down the tubes.  And this is going to cost us enormously. We go into recession, revenues are going to fall because there's going to be fewer people employed.  Government spending's going to rise because there's automatic spending increases in our budget.  People become unemployed, they'll go get unemployment insurance. It's going to cost us more than this package, a lot more than this package.  So it's not only about the very near term.  It's about the long run.  We can't take that chance.  If we go into recession, it's going to undermine the fundamentals of our economy.\", \"But this is the point, John.  This is -- let me try one more time.  Listen, if we go back into recession, all those fundamentals of our economy are going to erode.  All the good things, all the progress we've made is going is go away, and it's going to hurt the ability of businesses to hire and people to get jobs for the long run, for a long time to come. We are running the risk of going into a Japanese-like decade if we go back in a recession in six to nine months.  We just can't allow that to happen.\", 'This gets to the question of political economy.  We have no time left.', \"Wait, wait, wait.  If you want -- you asked me a question.  I'm going to answer it.  If we go down that path of trying to repeal these laws that have been in statute since 1930, we'll be debating this 10 years from now.  And we're toast.\", \"So in -- and here's the other point.  And I'm going to ask you a question.  Of $450 billion in the package --\", '$450 billion package.  How much of that is subject to the statutes that you are concerned about by America?', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 36 - No.  How much, exactly?', '$50 billion.', '50 out of the 450 billion.', 'Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. [applause]', 'I read the statute as well.', \"I just want to make one point about the jobs package.  You know, there is money in the package, about 50 billion for unemployment insurance -- additional unemployment insurance, but in addition to that, there are a number of reforms to the unemployment insurance system that have been proposed.  When Cece talked about the work share that's very popular in Germany and credited for German success, there's also a very popular program in Georgia called Georgia Works that helps send unemployed workers to get on the job training.  These are things that have historically had bipartisan support. There's empirical evidence that they work reasonably well. They do address some of the concerns Dan brought up.  I -- they're reasonable concerns. You know, you can't dismiss them.  So I think it's very important to realize that in the package there are efforts to address some of these things.\", \"Yeah, no, I was just going to make the point that the Germans provided just as much fiscal support to their economy as we did in the recession.  The difference is that in Germany, they have automatic stable -- what's called automatic stabilizers in their budget.  That means that there is more unemployment insurance.  There is more welfare. There are -- the tax code is such that you generate a lot more fiscal support.  In the U.S., we have some automatic stabilizers, but they're not nearly as large as in Europe. And therefore, when we get into recessions, we rely more on what we're calling fiscal stimulus. That is temporary tax cuts and temporary spending.\", 'So in terms of the fiscal support to the economy, the Germans did exactly what we did in terms of the GDP.', \"He's a tough moderator, isn't he?  I mean he --\", \"Yeah, it is. Scott Stevens: I haven't had a chance to read that.\", \"Yeah.  Which, as I said earlier, means it's right, right?\", \"Do you have something else you'd like to say?\", 'Yeah.', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - Right. Scott Stevens: And while you're at it --\", \"Yes, and the Cardinals will win the World Series, yes. [laughter] You like that, huh? Well, if you do the arithmetic, the math, under current policy, if there is no change in policy, federal fiscal policy will shave 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth in 2012. State and local governments cuts will take the total fiscal drag -- this is the headwind to the economy -- to two percentage points of GDP.  The Obama jobs package provides stimulus equal to two percent of GDP.  So the intent is to neutralize the fiscal drag. Now, you know, if I were king for the day, I'd say, you know, we can digest some fiscal austerity.  We don't have to go the whole Monty here, but we need to do something. We can't just -- we're not going to be able to digest two percentage points [unintelligible].\", 'No, no, I think I got it right. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 51 - [laughter]', \"You're not giving me a chance to respond to that, John?  What's that all about?\", 'Okay, all right. [laughter]', 'Thank you John.  I want to thank you for the opportunity again.  And I commend the other group for articulating their views so thoughtfully. I sympathize with a lot of whats being said by the other group.  I do think that the economy is encumbered by regulatory, legal uncertainty.  We have made some major changes to our economy, to our health care system, to our banking system.  And these are difficult things for businesses and individuals to adjust to.  And I do think we need to work hard in reducing that regulatory and legal uncertainty.  And we do need to take steps to address our long-term problems.  Again I think its vital that we work to achieve fiscal sustainability, to get the long term deficits down so that our nation doesnt go the way of Europe or France.  I think tax reform is absolutely vital. I think its key to bring down the tax expenditures, the tax credits and deductions in the tax code, make the tax code much fairer, simpler.  I think our economy would be better for it.  And I actually am quite optimistic about our economic prospects.  I think, as I said earlier, we have come a long way.  Our economy has righted a lot of the wrongs that got us to this point. Were really very close.  We just cannot go back into recession in the near future.  That would be damaging, the collective psyche is on edge.  Youre nervous; Im nervous; were all very frazzled.  Recession will just tip us over.  The Obama jobs package, even if its passed in small parts, would go a long way to ensuring that we dont go back into recession and that bright economic future actually will be upon us I think sooner than we realize.

      "['Charles Murray:', 'Peter Thiel:']\n",
      "[\"That's what I thought at the time.\", 'Oh, I now recommend that we abolish the SAT, because it turns out that if they give an achievement test, I probably would have gotten into Harvard that way too.  And the SAT, as it now exists, has taken on a really bad number.', \"I think we better get the topic straight.  When I agreed to debate on too many kids are going to college, I thought of college as being four-year colleges leading to the BA.  I didn't think of it as a whole range of community colleges and the rest. Anyway, that's the way I'm going to argue tonight because if the proposition were that too many kids are trying to get more education and training after high school, I wouldn't have accepted the position on the affirmative.  Almost everybody needs more education after high school.  What they don't need is to chase after this fraudulent, destructive, Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - antediluvian thing called a BA.  The thesis of my argument really is that the BA is the work of the devil. [laughter] Let's go through each of those accusations.  First, fraudulent.  The BA is supposed to signify, in a very old-fashioned term, that you are an educated man, now -- an educated person.  You know and I know that it doesn't represent that any more.  The number of colleges that require the core courses that's go into a liberal education is virtually not -- don't exist.  But it's much worse than that. If the only thing you know about a person is that that person has a BA, you don't know anything. If that seems too extreme, I can document all kinds of stories about courses in introductory economics which use magazine articles as the text about students who get a BA after four years without having to write a single solitary term paper, about exam scores which, by any traditional grading system means a D or an F.  But guess what? They're transmuted into Bs.  And why are they transmuted into Bs?  Because the story they want -- have now is retention, whereby the point of a college is to bring in as much tuition money as you can.  And you've got to retain kids. And in fact, if they want to drop out of courses and stay for five or six years instead of four, that's just fine with the college.  You can talk to employers all over the country who will tell you about applicants who have BAs, who can't write grammatical sentences in their applications and sometimes can't read very well. All of these things do not refer to the products of a few diploma mills.  I am talking about large chunks of the second tier and third tier state college and university systems. And I'm also talking about large numbers of courses and students in the first tier system and a whole lot of very expensive elite colleges.  Knowing what major a person had doesn't tell you very much. Yeah, if it's math, if it's hard sciences, if it's engineering, okay.  But what does it mean if you have a political science degree, spoken by a person who has a political science degree, if you're going to an employer and saying you ought to hire me.  It doesn't really mean anything.  Now, here is what you do know about a person with a BA if you know what school they came from.  So if the applicant came from Harvard, you know a whole lot about what person was like at age 18 before he went to college. You know he had terrific SAT scores, and you know he had a terrific high school record or he wouldn't have gotten in.  You don't know anything about what Harvard has added. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - And as a graduate of that institution, trust me, I am living proof of that statement in a whole bunch of ways.  None of this should be news to any of you.  The retreat of the academy from rigorous education is known to everybody who's in higher education. Except for majors in engineering and math and the hard sciences which account for just 12 percent of undergraduates, the bachelor's degree, all by itself, is meaningless.  Okay, destructive.  Even though we know that the BA is substantively meaningless, it remains true that for millions of jobs you can't get a job interview unless you have one.  And the problem is that employers are behaving rationally when they do that because you've got about 32 percent of adults that have a BA.  The employers know how clueless many of them are.  Why should they go outside that pool and take even lower levels of population in terms of their ability. So they're being rational.  But the problem is this:  We have created a kind of self- fulfilling prophecy.  We have created a culture in which not having a BA labels you, in the minds of way too many people, as being either dumb or lazy.  And so a lot of ambitious kids who have no interest in sitting in classrooms for four years and accumulating these large student loan debts, nonetheless want the piece of paper.  It is not surprising that we have all the horror stories which are documented in journal articles and large surveys, not anecdotally, of kids who take the easiest possible classes and don't study.  They aren't there to get an education.  They're there to get a piece of paper.  It is hugely destructive to have created this kind of false credential.  It is destructive to the majority of young people who don't try to go to college because they know college is not for them. It is destructive for about 40 percent of those who start college who never finish.  But most of all it is destructive to America's civic culture.  We have always prided ourselves upon the idea that everybody is equal in all the ways that count with regard to human dignity.  We have given a meaningless educational credential a role in our culture that says otherwise.  Antediluvian.  I have time just to state the proposition and hope to have a chance to elaborate later, the four-year brick and mortar college is obsolete.  Four years is almost always too long.  There's hardly any profession that requires four years of class work.  A lot of them require an apprenticeship much longer than that.  The rationale for a big physical plant at a residential college is just vanishing.  What's the rationale for having a library these days?  It used to be central. Why should it be that the brilliant professor giving a lecture where he doesn't take any individual relationships with students but just giving a superb lecture, why is he giving that lecture to 150 kids who happen to be sitting in the hall, why isn't it being given to Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - millions?  Distance education has all sorts of possibilities it didn't have before.  The information revolution is giving us a cornucopia of new ways to help kids get an education.  Well, that just begins to say what I want to say but what I'm really coming down to is nobody should go to college as the system is now defined.  What we need is a transformation that gives young people a chance to tell employers or for that matter to tell graduate admissions officers what they know and what they can do, not where they learned it and how long it took them.  Thank you.\", \"Well, I'm not doing that when I say that too many kid are going to college.  I'm coming at it -- again, let's go back to the American dream thing.  In 1960, which wasn't that long ago for somebody as old as I am, only eight percent of American adults had college degrees.  So college was a big deal then.  But 92 percent didn't, including most of the successful people in this country.  Not having a college degree had no relationship to the American dream at all at that time. College did have prestige.  But you didn't look down on somebody who hadn't gone to college.  And one of the things we don't like to say any more, but it is absolutely true, is we do now.  If you are just a high school graduate, you are a second class citizen in this country.  That is a kind of destruction of the American dream that I think it's becoming like a caste system where if you go not just to college but to an elite college, the doors will open and you are going to be a success, and you don't give [spelled phonetically] into that --\", \"No, I'm not.\", 'The caste system is real.  I mean, how many people out in the audience can tell to a fare-thee-well when someone says what college they graduated from, you know very well, you go clicking through your mind, and you can place that college as to where it is in the stratification.', \"If that's the only bit of information you have about a person, you don't know a thing.\", 'But look at the way the caste system persists because you have good jobs which is being a lawyer or a doctor or a scientist, and then you have menial jobs.  Now, tell me where it is written that we ought to --', 'But let me finish my sentence.', \"That we ought to think about what is more intrinsically rewarding about being a lawyer than being a cabinetmaker?  Why does that have -- should that have any privilege over being a cabinetmaker?  There are a whole lot of jobs in this world which are wonderfully fulfilling that don't require a college degree and we talk about them as being vocational training. That is a kind of invidious caste system in education that I want to destroy by getting rid of college degrees.\", \"Wait a minute, skill jobs, listen, you want to hire a lawyer or a doctor you can do that in a nanosecond.  You want to find good skilled labor?  That's hard.  Finding a good plumber, a good electrician to come and fix things, that's hard.  We have a demand for a wide variety of skills -- [applause] -- a wide variety of skills that we aren't meeting because guess what that's demeaning [unintelligible] those occupations.\", 'You know, one of the great television shows on TV is \"Dirty Jobs.\"  Any of you ever seen it?

Most of them are at West Podunk State or its equivalent. And you are talking about course that theyre no relation --', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 40 - Yeah, you take the state university systems which usually have about three tiers. Theres the, like Ohio State and Iowa University and so forth.  Then theres a second tier of colleges which are acknowledged to be not nearly as good even though theyre four- year and sometimes theres a third tier.  And those are the places where you are getting the courses that teach economics with magazine articles, that teach Shakespeare by having kids watch movies of Shakespeares plays but you dont ask them to read them, places where kids do not -- Im not talking anecdotes.  Im talking surveys about the percentages of kids who graduate from college unable to write grammatical sentences. Critical thinking doesnt enter the realm of college life in those places.', 'Well, may I respond first by saying that if the required course in the humanities was to take The Epic Poem from Homer to Milton, Id say thats great.  If its to take The Epic Film from Ben Hur to Lord of the Rings, its not so great. So well -- so what we have as course requirements in this country, it just doesnt fit this image you want to see of people sitting Aristotle and the classics and the rest of it.  Its not the curriculum.', \"Well, since I said that virtually everybody needs more education and training after high school, obviously, I think that high school is not sufficient. I do think that a great deal of what we talk about as a liberal education can be done at the K-12 level.  There are things like the core knowledge curriculum that's created by Edie Hirsch, which is just wonderful.  And it doesn't teach everybody a full-fledged classical education, but it -- it gets a lot of the common cultural knowledge for everyone in K-12.  We aren't doing it in college. I think we could do it there.\", \"I think that even though we're supposed to be diametrically opposed, in fact theres a lot of common ground.  Its not a very good thing to say in a debate.  But suppose we got rid of the B.A. because it doesnt mean anything.  Suppose we had as the goal of education not this piece of paper, but we had as a goal of education that all children shall reach adulthood having discovered things they love to do and having learned how to do them well.  If we take that as the goal of education, we will have a system utterly different from the one we have now, and it will not be college as we know it.  It will not be four years, and a lot of times, it wont be residential. And most of all, it will not separate people into those who are college graduates and those who are not.  And the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 49 - fact is that every career -- excuse me -- goes through a couple of phases.  We all start out as apprentices. And after we learn our trade, we become journeyman.  And some of us who get really good at it become master craftsmen.  That is just as true of a history professor or a lawyer or a physician as it of a carpenter or a plumber or an electrician.  The kinds of changes we need to make to our educational system, sweeping, fundamental reforms, getting rid of the B.A., moving to certifications, has as its ultimate goal, in my view, something that is very important for America as it is increasingly stratified by class.  And that is that it promotes a recognition among us that we are all engaged in the same process.  We are not divided into professionals and service workers or blue collar workers.  We all start out as apprentices.  We become journeyman, and we all strive to become master craftsmen.  Thank you.\"]\n",
      "[\"Just got started, but we selected 24 students for the first two-year cohort.  And they've been starting over the last month or two, and it's off to a really great start.\", '1989.', \"That is correct.  I'm going to start with that fact, actually, but yes, that is very true.\", \"Thank you.  Let me actually just start with that question.  You know, I went to Stanford undergrad, Stanford law school.  Throughout the '90s, I had a belief that education was absolutely paramount.  We should only hire people that went to the best schools.  And - - and we discriminated on this basis very aggressively in hiring at PayPal.  And I use this - - and I used to -- I thought this was the most important thing in our society.  And over the last four or five years, I've gradually come to shift my views on it for a number of different reasons.  The narrow technology context in Silicon Valley, that I saw so many very talented people who had not gone through college tracks and who had still done extraordinary well.  In some ways, they were also more creative. They were not laden down with enormous college debt that was somehow forcing people to take better paying jobs that were more munitive [spelled phonetically] but more boring, and track them into things that were not as interesting or important, that were discouraging people from doing things in nonprofit work or on the more entrepreneurial side.  And this has become a more and more acute issue over the years because unlike the time when I went to college, the cost has gone up tremendously. The amount of debt that people leave college with have gone up tremendously.  And so the choices are very different from the ones people had 25 years ago.  College costs in nominal dollars have gone up by more than a factor of 10 since 1980.  Even after inflation, it's gone up by 300 percent.  Costs about four times as much.  Inflation adjusted to go to college now as it did 30 years ago, it's gone up more than anything else in our society, more than health care, more than housing, more than any of a number of other things we think of as having been subject to runaway cost inflation and escalation. And as I looked outside of just the narrow Silicon Valley entrepreneurial context I've come to believe that the problem is much broader, it's not just the most talented people who are perhaps being misdirected and encouraged to go on a very narrow tracked career, but that this is a broader problem and that we are in fact experiencing something of a bubble in education, a bubble that is as pernicious as the bubbles we had in technology in the '90s and housing in the 2000s, and like those two other bubbles is characterized by two things, number one, runaway costs where people are paying more and more for something where the quality hasn't gone up -- in the '90s it was tech stocks, in the 2000s it was housing -- education, I'm not saying it's worse than it was 30 years ago but I don't think it's gotten much better, and secondly by an incredible psychosocial dynamic where you cannot question it. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 6 - you could not question people buying houses, it was strictly taboo and forbidden, and in the same way this is the one thing people still really believe in our society.  And to question the value of education is like questioning existence of Santa Claus with three- year-old kids or something like that.  And while we're not trying to scare the children here or anything like that, we do think that we cannot afford to have a third bubble in this country.  We had two already.  They were catastrophically bad.  They led to enormous misallocation of resources.  And when we look at education more carefully there are a lot of worrisome signs.  Student debts at this point total over a trillion dollars, and when you look at how well people are doing who come out of college, they are still doing pretty well, they're still doing better than they used to, but the outperformance has been going down, and going down since about 2000. And, you know, the law school context I'm quite familiar with, there are about 50,000 people a year who graduate from law school in the U.S., there only are 30,000 legal jobs available in the U.S. and I would argue we have maybe too many lawyers as is, but we're producing way more for a society that probably already has too many.  The median wage for lawyers is 62,000 which isn't that great considering that you've taken on another quarter million in law school debt typically.  Pre-med, only about nine percent of the people who study pre-med have slots available to them in medical school.  The other 91 percent are wasting their time, and somebody should have told them that their freshman or sophomore year and not waited till their senior year or several years of post college to figure that sort of stuff out.  If you broaden the ambit more generally, there's something like 17 million people in the labor force who have college degrees and are basically doing unskilled work or find the narrow and extreme statistics, there's something like 6,100 people in the U.S. who have Ph.D.s and are doing janitorial work. And so when we say that education is important and paramount, that is true but it can also be a distortion and it can be a distraction from some of the very real problems we have as a society. We need to figure out how do we create more jobs, how do we create more good paying jobs. We don't have enough of either in our society.  And while education is linked to them, it's not this absolute thing.  And we want to question this notion that education is an absolute good or an absolute necessity.  And in fact when people say as our opponents do that it is an absolute good or an absolute necessity, you start ignoring all these problematic facts, you start making a lot of catastrophic approximations that abound.  And that's what we want to sort of push back a little bit. Let me say one thing that we're not arguing for.  We're not saying that nobody should go to college.  We're not saying that college is categorically a bad thing. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - We're not saying everybody should drop out.  We're simply saying that too many people are going to college, just like too many people are buying houses and too many tech companies were going public in the late '90s, doesn't mean there should be no tech companies or no houses, it doesn't mean we should shut down all the colleges, but we shouldn't -- we need to make this a much more careful deliberate choice.  And what we are hoping to start with this discussion and debate today is a discussion that would encourage all of you to think more about your future.  Do not think of education as something that's an automatic ticket to the future, you need to think about it yourself. If I had to do something over again, having gone to Stanford, I probably would still go to college even with the higher costs, if I didn't have any great ideas of what to do instead I'd probably still do the exact same thing as I did in the late '80s even with all the problems.  But one thing I would try to do very differently is not accept the answer that this was the automatic thing, that this was the thing you should do without thinking, I would have tried to think about what I want to do with my life as a senior in high school and a senior in college and not simply have more education be the automatic default answer for everything. The question we want to push the other side back on a little bit is if education is an absolute good or absolute necessity, who is accountable if it is a mistake? And if these people are taking on these enormous debts are getting it wrong, where can they go to get a refund?\", \"Well, it certainly was not historically part of the American dream.  So if you looked at how many people went to college in the U.S. in the 19th or early 20th century, it was a very, very small percentage.  And it was -- this is a very recent phenomenon that this is seen as an absolute necessity.  And I think -- I think in many ways I would actually flip it around, and I would say, what's gone wrong with the American dream that we have to have people go to college when that was never a necessity in the past.  People don't need college degrees for many of the jobs that we have.  There are many good jobs where you don't need them, many bad jobs.  People get stuck with college degrees.  But I'd actually flip it around.  This whole question of what sort of a good is college.  Is it an investment in your future?  I don't think it's a good investment because it's costing too Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - much, and there's no -- seemingly no accountability whatsoever from the other side on the costs. It was absolute good, any price.  Pay no attention what the price is.  Is it a consumption decision?  And I sort of have joked that it's like a four-year party.  And I think that's kind of true, but I think people are too stressed out to really have a four-year party when they're taking on a quarter million in debt and know they're going to be debt slaves for the rest of their lives or for the next 10, 20 years.  And so I think the way to think of it is that it's basically become an insurance policy because the cracks in our society have become so big.  And we need to be asking why are so many people having to pay more and more for insurance and what's gone wrong that we're paying so much for insurance.\", \"Let me just tackle this whole globalization international thing.  So I think there obviously are a lot of things that are very admirable about India, China.  People have a great work ethic.  They're thinking very much about the future.  And I do not want to at all underestimate how serious the competition is or to encourage people to be complacent. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - But the proposition we're debating today, do too many kids go -- are too many kids going to college, and if you look at those countries, the percentage is much smaller, and it is -- you know, I looked these numbers up because I figured -- I thought you might make this argument.  And the U.S. -- there are about 40 percent of college-aged students are in college.  And of course there are a lot of them that end up dropping out. It starts at more than 40.  But on average, 40 percent fromr in college.  In China, the number is 20 percent.  In India, the number is 10 percent.  And if you want to look at China and India, it is a brutally selective system.  Very few people can get in.  People are worked incredibly hard once they're in college.  And if we want to be more like them, the first thing -- simple approximation is you have far fewer people go to college.  And this is true of any other country in the world you'd look at.  And so if the U.S. should take its bearings from other countries, that is a very powerful argument for our side.\", \"But you can't have it both ways either.  You want to say on the one hand that college is an end in itself, it's an absolute good, we don't ask any questions about it, it's not instrumental, and on the other hand it is completely instrumental and it's what leads you to getting a better job, more high paying job.  You cannot have it both ways.\", \"Well, you know, we can find all sorts of anecdotal things.  We were told by the other side that we shouldn't look at anecdotes like Zuckerberg or Gates or Jobs and I agree those are exceptional cases, and there obviously are all sorts of people who have idiosyncratic things that can happen in college.  They can also happen outside of college. Socialization does not have to happen in college.  People should learn how -- you know, this is again a really bizarre recent phenomenon, you know, 92 percent of the people did not go to college in 1960, they were able to be citizens, they were able to vote, they because they didn't have college degrees. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 27 - That would have been an invidious thing to say.\", 'Oh, I think there are extraordinary conflicts of interest.  Its like subprime mortgage brokers saying people should buy houses.  I mean, the self dealing that is going on is incredibly severe in all of this.  And I do think --', 'One other -- one last point.  I dont think you can separate the question entirely from the cost question.  And so its like saying, you know, Mrs. Lincoln, besides that, howd you like the play?  So besides the fact that college costs you an arm and a leg, how much do you like it? And these two things are linked together.', \"I think -- I think what Charles and I -- what Charles and I agree on very much is that there is no one size fits all approach.  There are certain skilled people, very talented people. Not every talented person should go to Harvard.  You know, there are a lot of different kinds of things different people should do.  And I think that's -- that's sort of a basic Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - starting point.  We don't believe there is a single straight jacket.  And the crazy thing in our society is that the more talented you are, the narrower the straight jacket has become.  This is a very, very bizarre feature [spelled phonetically] of it. We also agree that learning is generally a very good thing.  And we agree that we should be -- I think we all four of us agree on that.  But there's a bit of a disagreement that I don't want to understate, is that a great deal of what masquerades as learning is nothing more than credentialing.  And the basic numbers I've seen is that it's something like 90 percent credentialing, 10 percent learning if you try to sort of break the numbers out.  If you got into Harvard versus finishing high school, let's say you make 30,000 a year in -- out of high school, 60,000 a year out of Harvard.  Let's say it's two to one, something in that ballpark.  You get to 45,000, if you were good enough to get into Harvard, that's the selection.  And you get to 57,000 people knew you got into Harvard, that's the signaling.  So 90 percent is credentialing.  And the learning gets you from 57 to 60.  We're in favor of that 10 percent.  But it is outrageous how it's been conflated with this credential which is being parasitically charged to people in this -- way costs have escalated and escalated and escalated.\", \"Well, I think -- I think the social networks are quite valuable.  It's -- it's not clear people should be -- it's still not clear that it justifies the college's paying -- charging a quarter million.  I think the social networks tend to be the most valuable only at the elite colleges.  Once you go below that level, they actually function in a way where people, again, do not have access.  So I think you have a very ambiguous aspect -- aspect about how it works.  In practice, in Silicon Valley, most of the companies do get started by people who are a few years out of college.  And I tend to think that when I started Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 - PayPal, there were some people I brought in from Stanford, but you know, I started with a colleague who, we met in a different social context in Silicon Valley. And we'd gone to different schools, so it ended up being somewhat -- my own experience was different.  But I think -- you know, I do -- I do think elite colleges have a social networking value. It's very -- that's a very oddly different thing from what we've heard here.  That's very different from that's about learning, that it's about turning people into citizens or anything like that.  And it seems to me that even if that's true, it should cost way, way less.\", \"Well, I didn't know what else to do.  And I think I probably would not have known what else to do.  In some ways, I was probably a candidate for a good general liberal arts humanities education in many ways.  I was really interested in learning.  I was very interested in these things on their terms.  I don't think most people are like me.  I think a lot of people are at a different -- at a different place.\", \"It's -- I don't think people are identical.  I think this is like -- this is --\", \"I know that this is a big philosophical disagreement we have.  We should not understate. I don't think everybody is cut from the same cloth.  People are actually different.  And we need to acknowledge the diversity that exists in our world and we shouldn't pretend that everybody is the same and everybody should do the same thing.\", \"But -- but, I think -- [applause] I think the -- I think that -- I think that most -- I think that there are a lot of people already in high school who were not academically motivated.  And I can say that even if they do not know what they wanted to do professionally or work wise, you could say they weren't particularly interested in reading books and learning.  And this was not their talent.  That's not what they were psyched to do.  And there is something crazy about saying everyone has to be locked into a room and read books and -- and that's what we have to do. [talking simultaneously]\", 'So --', '-- I actually very much disagree with almost every premise posted in that question but just let me -- [laughter] -- let me just --', \"-- I'll just flag one.  The most concrete skill oriented education people get is engineering degrees, and that is actually probably the one area and we may even agree on this where I think the U.S. does not have an excess of engineers.  And but that is something that's specific and tracked and engineering is specific and that's what people get paid for the most.  And as we were heading into a more technologically oriented world, that's actually -- there's going to probably be an increasing premium on engineering and on specific types of skills.  And if I had to give people advice and they were set on going to college, you should study engineering or some form of engineering unless you are in a really unusual situation and really passionate about something else. So I would sort of quibble with the question on that level.\", \"Well, you know, I think there is -- I think it pays off but not nearly as much as you think because I still think it's mostly correlation and just a tiny bit causation.  But I want to quibble a little bit more with the idea of the data shows and what this means. And we're always looking backwards.  And so 2005, you could have said the data shows that housing prices always go up.  And they are less likely to go up if they've gone up a lot.  And so what I will tell you as an analytic truth, not an empirical truth, when people are paying way more than they ever have, there are going to be more people who have been hurt than who were hurt in the '50s or '60s, when it was effectively free.  And so -- and this will not be seen in advance. You will see this in 10, 15, 20 years time.  You're starting to see it with college students, have to move back in with their parents because they cannot afford to get their own place and pay off their debts.\", \"It's -- what I think we are seeing a gradually unravel with the -- with this incredible recession in the U.S. because the basic lie that you take on all this debt, and then you get a good job is being seen as not quite true. And there are many cases where it's not true.  And I basically think it's sort of -- we see it unravel over four or five years as you have one class after another graduate, and there Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 - are no good jobs, even for the people with college degrees. I would say it's different from housing because there's no specific market.  You can't precisely evaluate a college degree.  And that's actually one of the things that makes it a much more pernicious bubble than housing because it will not pop instantly, and therefore it's likely to be actually even more pronounced and more extreme before it unravels.\", \"It's possible that that's -- well, I think high school is very -- lots of them are still very good.  A lot of them are not.  But I -- it seems to me that that's a perverse cure for the disease.  And so if that is the disease, we should be fixing K through 12 education. And I think probably all of us on the panel would agree that K through 12 education has a lot of room for improvement. [applause]\", 'The one thing that was clearly not done by the other side was to answer my question about where would the accountability be for all the people who get hurt by the system that costs too much and is not delivering.  And it is clear to me that there is no accountability on the part of our education establishment.  They\\'re not willing to give people refunds.  They\\'re not -- you know, if you get a Ford and it blows up, a Ford Pinto blows up, you can go to the Ford company, you can get money back for your car, you Intelligence Squared U.S. - 47 - might even be able to sue them for torts, such a mentality is unthinkable in the college case.  And given that there is this lack of accountability, buyer beware.  You are on your own.  You take on the loans.  It\\'s worse than housing debt.  You can never get out of it, not even through bankruptcy. Bush amended the bankruptcy laws in 2005 so you cannot get out of college debts for the rest of your life.  And you need to think about this on your own.  The way bubbles end is when people start thinking for themselves.  And that is the first thing we want to encourage people to do is not to simply go with the social pressure, not to go with the bill of goods, \"This has always been done.  This is automatic.  This is necessary.  This is globalization.\"  But think for yourself, \"Is the cost worth the benefit?\"  And when more people think for themselves about this, we will get to a very different equilibrium where there\\'s less of a caste system, less of a social need to do these things for status reasons, people will still go to college, they will still get advance degrees, but there will be fewer of them who do it because there are a lot of people who are doing it for the wrong reasons, and I think that will be a much healthier and more balanced country.']\n",

      "['I punked it from Herbert Hoover.', 'He was my great grandfather, though I never knew him.  He passed away 13 years before I was born.', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - I found surprisingly Hoover channels the millennial ethos.', \"Thank you, John, and thanks to Bob Rosenkranz for the opportunity to participate here tonight on a stage with such distinguished public figures.  I am well aware that I am the junior on this stage.  And as such, I will argue in favor of this motion from the perspective of Junior whose future is imperiled by Grandma's benefits.  The juniors in this argument are the millennials.  This is the rising generation in America, 30 and unders, born at beginning of the Reagan era to the end of the Clinton presidency.  At 33 years of age, I am on the cusp of this rising generation and have been paying into Social Security and Medicare for eight years.  I am told that as long as I pay into the system, this system will be there for me.  By the time I reach my full retirement age of 67, 34 years from now in 2045, I'll expect to receive the same benefits equal to that which I paid into the system. And if I have planned on this, I will find my future severely imperiled.  Because eight years before I retire, the Social Security trust fund will have been depleted.  I will be surprised to discover that this trust fund was actually a myth, that it was in fact just a surplus of IOUs that had been lent out to other agencies of government to pay for their expanding programs. Beginning in 2037, Social Security will have to rely solely on the revenues from payroll taxes, which will be insufficient to cover the benefits promised to me and my generation. In addition, under current law, because of program insolvency, benefits will have to be cut by 23 percent or payroll taxes raised 30 percent. This sudden adjustment imperils the millennials economic future, affecting the poorest of those who are already dependent upon benefits.  The rude awakening is that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid were set up as pay as you go -- they were never set up as trust funds.  They are pay as you go programs.  The federal government does not and never has saved payroll tax revenues.  These have always been generational transfer programs from workers to retirees, such that the benefits for Grandma come directly out of the pockets of Junior.  By the time the first millennials reach their 40s in 2021, the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - cost of Medicare alone will be greater than our country's total defense spending.  Put all together with baby boomers hitting retirement, grandmas living longer, medical costs spiraling upwards, Social Security, Medicare expenses will consume about 12 percent of the nation's economic output in 2035, triple what it was in 1971. I would be remiss also if I didn't mention what we all know, which is that large parts of the federal budget are being financed by debt, 42 cents on every dollar.  And this debt, too, must be paid back.  By 2021, interest payments on the debt will be a bigger portion of the budget than our discretionary funding, which will contribute to a crowding out of spending in education, infrastructure, national defense and everything else that might be considered investment in our future. We all know this is unsustainable.  And the need for reform is obvious. This is not an appropriate legacy for Grandma to leave to Junior because it defies the social contract in which each generation strives to leave the country better off than it inherited it from its parents.  We need to revise the social contract to reflect the changes in our society in a way that keeps the faith with Grandma, does not cut her benefits on which she is now relying, but stops making promises to Junior that we simply cannot keep.  We can have a generous, compassionate social welfare program for the elderly which is consistent with a dynamic economy in which workers have multiple employers over their careers, stay active and healthy in the work force into their 70s.  This will require removing disincentives to longer careers, asking the more successful to shoulder more of their own retirement costs and health costs, and building stronger incentives for innovation and efficiency into our health system. Change is coming one way or the other, and it will either be deliberate, careful and well thought out, or it will be imposed by a chaotic and indiscriminate way.  If we take it upon ourselves to correct the -- America's social contract and be proactive, there will be nothing to fear from these changes.  This is the normal process of each generation of Americans, improving upon the strong institutions built by earlier generations.  And the millennial generations, the juniors of tonight's motion, want to be part of that solution. You are likely to hear from our opponents an unwavering commitment to early 20th century social insurance models and an inability to adapt them and their spirit to the 21st century economy and population.  They may accuse us of trying to take Grandma's benefits away from her or suggest that we believe that the federal safety net with a mistake in the first place. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - This is not true.  The only people who are talking about taking away Grandma's benefits are those who want to scare seniors for political reasons.  They may argue as well that entitlements, the benefits about which we are debating tonight, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, are not the problem at all, that the real problem for Junior is skyrocketing health care costs.  This is a tricky tactic intended to shift the focus of the debate.  Health care reforms are an important subject, just not the subject of tonight's debate.  The system that pays Grandma's benefits is imperiling Junior's future by making promises to Junior that it cannot keep, by paying for these benefits through borrowing that contributes to mounting national debt, 14 trillion and counting, thus imperiling Junior's fiscal and economic future. We encourage you to vote in favor of the motion. [applause]\", \"So no one is saying we should cut benefits now, especially to the seniors to whom we have promised.  There's no one out there saying that except the AARP who is trying to scare Grandma into continuing to not vote for entitlement reform, which is imperiling Junior's future.  I want to go back to this notion that 78 percent of benefits will be paid out because when you think about it, that's not a good deal.  I put in money my entire lifetime, and then, presuming that the benefits are going to be there, I can only expect to get 78 percent out? That's just not a good deal for the worker.  So -- did I answer the question that was --\", 'Who?', \"They're talking about reduction on future benefits, but no one [unintelligible].\", 'So you just admitted that there is a Social Security trust fund problem.', 'And I -- Male Speaker: Yeah. [applause]', 'Even if the trust fund is imperiled. Male Speaker: We had a --', 'So we need to fix it.  No, no, no.  But hold on.  But what Governor Dean has just said that it needs to be fixed.  And that is an implicit --', '-- agreement with the motion.', 'I can tell you three things I agree with Howard Dean.  I agree with we need to get fee for service.', 'Thank you.', \"[unintelligible] straw man.  To answer Jeff's question, insolvency, this inflammatory rhetoric is not rhetoric that Mort and I made up.  In insolvency is the word used by CBO, by actuaries of Social Security.  And it refers to the fact that these programs will not be able to deliver on their promises by that year 2037.  Not my inflammatory rhetoric, the rhetoric of Social Security actuaries.  Now, with Governor Dean, you've agreed that these programs are in jeopardy. To the extent that these programs are in jeopardy, you are then agreeing implicitly with the motion that those promises that have been delivered -- or that have been promised to Junior will not be able to be delivered upon, and therefore, his future is imperiled.\", \"I agree with you.  I believe we agree with you, that rising health care costs are very, very important and one of the driving predictors in long term spending of these problems. The issue here though is about benefits. And Medicare and Medicaid are health care benefits.  And to the extent that health care costs are careening out of control and must be reformed, this is again an implicit affirmation of the motion that benefits are imperiling Junior's future.\", \"It's the same thing.\", 'I actually in one sense agree with Governor Dean.  I agree that the health care system needs to be reformed so that medical costs come down because I agree with the premise that it is medical costs that are careening out of control.  I think Governor Dean and I have dramatically different ideas about how we would contain costs.', \"Well, in some sense in the medical profession there is too much care because it's fee for service, you have -- Mort has written about tort reform, you have moved patients away from the marginal cost of their health care. And as a result, because they dont know -- theres no transparency.  They dont know how much theyre buying, paying for services.  In addition, doctors are constantly checking boxes to cover their CYA sort of movement so that they dont get sued.  You have an enormous amount of spending in health care that is unnecessary.\", 'I actually agree with that.  I just have a difference -- so --', 'I mean, I just think that were arguing this notion of benefits, and Medicaid and Medicare are benefits.  And the way these benefits are structured are imperiling Juniors future.  And I think theyre saying the same thing, but theyre trying to say its not the benefits.  Its the health care. But the benefits are the health care. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 29 -', \"Thanks for the Hoover reference, too, there. [laughter] You know, I couldn't agree with you more.  Juniors do need to be part of this debate. And the one thing that really characterizes the millennial generation is a desire to be part of the solution. But I will say when we talk about this compromise that happened with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan in 1983, we have to remember too, they were months away from seniors not getting their benefit checks.  So one of the things I worry about is that politicians need their next election to be hanging in the balance before they can actually be mobilized to do anything.\", \"I just -- it seems to me as though you're setting up this false choice, in saying, we don't need to save Social Security.  Six percent of GDP is nothing.  You know, 6 percent of GDP is more than $800 billion less than $900 billion.  That's not nothing.  And for an economy that is $14 trillion in debt, it's the Ben Franklin saying, if you mind your pennies, the dollars will take care of themselves.  So this notion that we can just sort of ignore one and just take it is just fiscally irresponsible. [applause]\", \"Yeah.  What seems to be agreed upon here, and what Jeff just said, too, was that the fix is easy.  We know what the fix is.  And it's true, CBO has scored 30 different fixes for Social Security. But then if we agree that there needs to be a fix, we agree that there's a problem, and we agree that Grandma's benefits are imperiling Junior's future. [applause]\", \"So -- and we agree in many ways on what the problems are:  Fee for service.  Governor Dean agreed with us that fee for service is a problem, though we have dramatically different ideas about how to address that.  And I think you're right that our politics have become so polarized that you cannot simply come to the table admitting that there are going to be principal differences and figure out how to -- how to work it out.  And the political game and the bomb throwing has made touching Medicare or social security a third rail for anyone who tries to take it on.  Look what's happened to Paul Ryan who puts forth a plan that you might not like.  But he puts down a plan that goes through the trouble of getting it scored by CVO.  And the next thing we know, there's a commercial of him throwing Grandma off a cliff.\", \"That's nuts.\", \"That's part of the problem.\", \"I would just say, I -- on the one hand, I completely agree with Governor Dean.  On the other hand, you're the one who just said, Paul Ryan pushed Grandma over the cliff.\", \"So you resembled -- but you're resembling this partisanship that is polarizing the debate and not letting us get to the solution the millennials are trying to get to. [applause]\", 'So throughout our countrys history, Americans have found the courage to do right by our childrens future.  Deep down, every American knows that we face a moment of truth again.  We cannot play games or put off hard choices any longer.  Without regard to party, we have a patriotic duty to keep the promise of America, to give our children and grandchildren a better life.  Our challenge is clear and inescapable.  America cannot be great if we go broke.  These are not my words, but the words from the preamble of President Obamas National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.  This is not inflammatory language from the far right.  This was a bipartisan commission by Democrat Erskine Bowles, Republican Alan Simpson, appointed by Democratic President Obama. There is broad consensus that we are on a course of fiscal disaster.  Again, not inflammatory language but language that is used broadly by Democrats and Republicans alike, embodied by this panel, Mort as a Democrat and myself as a Republican.  I think Governor Dean has done fancy footwork by trying to make this about politicians and not about what the motion is about, which is that Grandmas benefits, which we all agree -- everyone on this panel agrees -- need to be fixed.  And everybody has their own solutions for fixing it.  That notion that they all need to be fixed is -- it confirms the motion that there is a problem with the system, that Juniors benefits are imperiled. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 52 - So I would just say for everyone in the audience who is in their 30s or younger, we should feel real urgency to address these problems and take on these reforms because its about our economic future and our economic prosperity.  So please vote with us.']\n",
      "['They were referring to my age, not my rank.', 'Well, as you\\'ve just heard, America\\'s in very difficult shape.  And the difficult truth that we must face is that we are on the verge of an exploding public sector debt that can have a very, very negative effect on our economic future.  As one cynic put it, our future isn\\'t what it used to be. Social Security was born amid harsh times of the Great Depression, marked by unemployment, homelessness and even starvation.  We then made a deal with the American workers, to wit, that nobody who paid into the system would be left empty handed.  To this was added Medicare, health insurance in the mid 1960s and the protection against inflation in the 1970s.  These initiatives changed the economics of old age.  In a mere four decades, poverty rates among the elderly, which Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - had been three or four times that of the general population, fell below the rates for younger Americans. To this day, social security still means the difference between poverty and economic security for millions of retirees, children and many American workers.  It is the primary source of income for two-thirds of older Americans and the single most important antipoverty program for children, millions of whom live in households supported by disability, survivor or retiree beneficiaries.  It creates intergenerational benefits as parents and grandparents can live independently of their working children and often become the childcare providers for children while the parents work. When Social Security began making monthly distributions in 1940, there were 160 workers for every senior receiving benefits.  Today, there are about three workers.  And within two decades, there will be two.  Demographic are destiny.  The message could not be clearer.  Social Security needs fixing. It has been fixed before.  Social Security taxes have been raised 40 times since the program began, most recently in 1983.  The initial Social Security tax was two percent, split between the employer and the employee, capped at $3,000 of earnings, which made for a maximum tax of $60.  Today the tax is approximately 13 percent, capped at $106,800 for a maximum of tax of $13,234, a multiple of 80 times the original tax.  So what is to be done?  Despite the natural sympathy for those looking forward to their retirement, we cannot avoid the issue of Social Security insolvency. Here are some options to deal with this problem, one, gradually raising the retirement age to reflect the longevity increases that have already taken place.  In the future, retirement age should be indexed automatically to rise with longevity.  Two, raising employer and employee payroll taxes by up to one percent each. Three, eliminating or gradually raising the cap on taxable payroll income, reflecting the fact that higher incomes are rising faster than the Social Security taxable earnings.  Four, increasing the earliest eligible age, EEA, as it\\'s called, from 62 to 65, which alone would extend the trust fund solvency by about five years.  Current retirees would be unaffected.  And exceptions would be made for Americans who cannot work longer due to injury, ill health, or other causes.  Modest reductions in benefits for wealthier recipients should also be considered.  We must address these challenges soon or Grandma\\'s welfare will in fact undermine the quality of life for her grandchildren and give meaning to the phrase which my partner and I have found out, we\\'ll both, quote, \"Blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt.\"  I might add -- Intelligence Squared U.S. - 6 - [laughter] -- that was originally stated by my partner\\'s grandfather.  The greatest risk facing America\\'s fiscal future comes from the projected increases in Medicaid and Medicare spending that could raise the deficits dramatically in the next couple of decades. Arithmetic still matters.  Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million Americans.  It finances more than one third of all births in the United States, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes.  The federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the income level of each state.  Even so, Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending.  Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade.  In the next -- by the mid-1930s -- 2030s, the 65 and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of World War II, may be completely out of control, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending. The basic fact is that the first baby boomer statistically retired on January 1 of this year, but there are 79 million more of them.  Multiply that by estimated annual benefits of $40,000 that they will be receiving, and you\\'re looking at $3 trillion a year just for that portion of the population.  Erskine Bowles, the co-chair of the bipartisan Simpson- Bowles Commission, put it well, \"This is a fiscal crisis that is completely predictable and from which there is no escape. This concern has been shared by many, many institutions, the Post, the Washington Post, the Fed chairman, Bernanke, and countless others.  Now, the only way to cut entitlement costs is to cut entitlement costs.  The current programs as they play out will be unsustainable without giant tax increases or huge cuts in other government programs.  We should remember as we address this problem that less is enough if it comes earlier, so the sooner the better. Now, this is a nation founded on opportunity, not entitlement, on thrift, not conspicuous consumption, on stewardship and not living for today, but taking steps to make sure that we are creating a better tomorrow, such that future generations would have as much or more opportunity and a better standard of living.  To keep these entitlements under fiscal control is about keeping the American dream alive.  I know the American dream because I\\'m one of the people who was attracted to this country many years ago from Canada where 50 percent of the graduating class of American universities moved to the United States, attracted as we were by the remarkable energy Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - and optimism and mobility and upward mobility of this country, not to mention the president, John Kennedy.  Today it is Canada\\'s government that has shown best how to manage these kinds of problems as they work their way through perilous economic times without threatening its future. But much as I like Canada, I don\\'t want my children moving there because of the narrowing of opportunity at home.', \"That's not the only proposals that are out there.  And we're basically talking about people just coming into the system having to deal with it.  I mean, the fact is when FDR introduced Social Security, the average life expectancy was 62.  It's now 80.  You don't have a system that doesn't take that into account unless you just want the system to go bust.  So you've got to find some way to correlate revenues and ultimately payouts. So I don't think these are unreasonable things to have some way of -- and we've done it. We've done it many, many times, okay?  We did it in 1983 when Tip O'Neill as the speaker of the House, and President Reagan got together and did that, okay?  They improved the fiscal stability of that thing.  We want these things to work.  If you can guarantee that this thing is going to work by one magical system or another, great.  But you can't.\", 'Not with all the people who are going to be retiring, the 79 million people who --', '-- are baby boomers.', \"Call it what you will.  We have a Democratic president, Democratic control of the Senate and Democratic control of the House, and we did nothing about these issues.  When you can get any kind of mix of politics -- I don't care whether they're the Republicans or the Democrats -- who can really change what you're talking about changing, the tax rates, the immigration codes, you name it, I'll agree with everything you want to say.  But in the meantime, these programs are in jeopardy.  And everybody who has looked at it has agreed that they are in jeopardy in one form or another.  And I would therefore say to you, as long as you can sort of hypothesize these unavailable, impossible programs, sure, you can find other ways to solve it.  But in the meantime, we're living with these programs.  We haven't been able to solve it, and nobody's been able to do it since 1983.\", \"I share the view just expressed that I want to completely redo the health care system, the medical profession, how they get paid, end fee for services -- [applause] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 26 - -- change the whole hospital system, revolutionize the whole thing, and I'm ready as soon as that is done to take the same approach that you're talking about with respect to health care and Social Security.  However, until then and in the slight possibility even when you were chairman of the Democratic Party that you weren't able to institute this in this country, in the slight possibility that that will not happen, let's find something to have a fallback position just in case we can't revolutionize the country. [applause]\", 'No, but what you are saying, if the current system -- and I couldnt agree with you more about the fee for services, because its counter to everything and more.  You pay for more, not for better in that system.  And I agree with that, okay.  All Im saying to you is that it is almost impossible for me to imagine that youre going to change that, at least within my lifetime, and maybe within the lifetime of Junior.  And I have a couple of young juniors. I just dont see that happening.  I hope it does.  But I dont know what its going to take. All I can say is Ill give you an example.  Tort reform in New York State -- a whole group of us tried to get a cap on damages of $250,000 as a maximum for tort liability medical issues.  We couldnt get it.  But if we had gotten it, we would have saved $600 million a year in New York State alone, just for the hospitals.  Now, its almost impossible to get these things done.  In the meantime, I want to make sure that the health care system or the Medicare and Medicaid and the Social Security system do not break the bank, do not destroy the future of this country.  When we are able to change those other things, Ill agree with you. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 28 -', 'No, I mean, look, there are all kinds of different programs, including some of them that are implicit in your question or comments.  And the real problem is you have to weigh the probability of getting some of those things done.  I wish we could get them done, frankly.  I wish we could get toward liability.  I wish we could change fee for services.  I wish we could change the whole system.  I have here a little cartoon from the New Yorker, just to show you.  This is two -- two policemen interrogating Bernie Madoff. The lights are shining on him, and the cop says, \"All right, Madoff, where did you get the idea of paying early investors with money from late investors?\" he says, \"From the Social Security system.\" [laughter] Now, all I\\'m saying is --', \"We have to look at these things -- we have to look at these things and make them as self-sustaining financially as possible.  You can't revolutionize the whole country to solve this problem because it'll never get done.  And we will not necessarily go broke in a total sense.  But we will -- as a country, we will end up in a very, very different kind of place. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 31 -\", \"The fact is health care has improved dramatically. That's why longevity has improved so dramatically.  So we are in fact seeing a totally different aging of the population.  We had something really unique which is that there were baby boomers.  We have 79 million of them coming into this system over the next several years, without going into the exact number.  Their benefits alone will add $3 trillion a year to this thing. We've got to find some way to make that still viable.  I don't disagree with anything you're saying in one sense, which is that we can improve the health care system, without question.  And we are improving it.  And all kinds of benefits are coming from it, longevity being the first one.  When we -- the original idea of health care was not necessarily to -- I mean of Social Security, was not necessarily to provide retirement income for people to the ages of 90, whatever that new longevity will take us to.  When that was passed -- as I said, the median age was 62.  That was the median longevity.  We're now at 80.\", \"There's nothing wrong with taking that into account.\", 'Well, let me just say --', \"Well, I -- we had not frankly addressed that particular issue.  What we are saying is there's got to be some combination of factors that has to make the system viable for a much longer time than it currently is.  And we think that's important.  We've done it many times in the past.  There is no problem in my judgment, no overwhelming problem in doing it now.  It is true on the health care side that you have a real problem of the health care system.  That is so difficult to do in the meantime, it seems to me. We've got to make sure that these various programs do not go bust or in fact put such a burden of debt on this country that we'll simply not be able to spend the money on so many other things whether it's education or infrastructure or police or whatever you Intelligence Squared U.S. - 38 - have to do, and that-- it's just going to drain it.  And in fact if you go from five percent of GDP to 13 percent of GDP which is where our health care costs are driving us, you're going to take a huge amount out of what we otherwise need for the kind of country that we'd like to think we want to have in the future.\", 'Well, I think that is true.  The point that I would make, though, is that when people are paying the Social Security taxes, its when theyre working.  Were trying to protect that system for the people when they retire.  It is certainly true that when they retire, this being in most cases their only source of income, theyre going to spend it.  And Im just Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - as happy to have people, when theyre working, contribute more to this system to make sure that it is viable.', 'I -- look, theres only one way to do that.', \"Well, I do think that the notion of changing fee for services, which I am totally in favor of, or trying to get a cap on medical tort liability, which I'm totally in favor of, I can't imagine how that's going to happen for a very long time.  I do think we still, in the interim, can introduce some modest changes to the Social Security system which we've been doing since the initiation of that program.  And they did it, as I said, in 1983.  What it will take, to answer the question, is political leadership.  And that's what we don't have and haven't had for years, who really -- people who really want to address this because they feel they're going to lose votes in one place or another. And that's the sad part if we have a system.  In Canada, for example, they're doing it very differently.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 43 - And -- and it's really working, with a different kind of political leadership, with a different kind of politicalism.  We don't have that.\", \"Absolutely, without a question.  Nobody suggested cutting the benefits.  Frankly, if there would be any benefits cut, I would cut them for the well-to-do.  So I would put in an income standard for that.  But on all the other benefits, absolutely not.  What we're trying to do is to make it possible for us to afford to continue to pay those benefits.  And so I'm just going to go to one issue because this is a chance for me to say, even though it's not relevant.  If Bill Clinton has a wonderful idea for how you deal with health insurance, private health insurance, where in most states one or two companies really dominate the entire health insurance med space [spelled phonetically]. He said, you just put in one line into their policies, mandate it, that 85 percent of the premiums they receive go to health care benefits, and the rest of it, only the rest of it can go to promotion and profits.  And he said you would have a major improvement in that. Well, fine.  I'm ready to sign onto that.  Any time you -- when I'm president, the first appointed, Canadian Jewish president, I'm willing -- [laughter] I'm willing to sign that legislation.\", 'Well, just about every serious review of the benefits in broad term of entitlement programs in part because of the problems that the governor mentions which is the problems in our health care system which are much more intractable than dealing with the entitlement programs\\' financial problems.  Virtually everybody says \"We\\'ve got to do somebody about that.  Now, the question is, if you had to make a pragmatic judgment as to what you could do about it, I have to say to you that some of the proposals that are put forth by the other side are about as likely as -- well, you name it, as Governor Dean becoming president. [laughter] No, I -- believe me, I\\'ve been a Democrat all my life.  I would have supported him, had he got the nomination, but he did not get the nomination, and at this stage of the game he\\'s not in that political mood [spelled phonetically].  But I would just say to you that these are very, very serious, serious times for us.  This country is on the verge of losing a great deal of the economic energy that it has had, in part because of the failures of our political system.  But we have to deal at least with those programs it seems to me that protect the elderly.  And this is something I\\'m totally in favor of.  I opposed the Bush tax cuts when they came about.  I supported reinstating the tax levels when other democratic presidents reintroduced some of the Bush tax cuts.  I didn\\'t support that. But whatever it is, we\\'ve got to do something about these programs or else in fact the burdens that they are going to imply in terms of the deficit that this country is going to have to undertake in order to deal with these programs, is going to do immense damage to the very future of the people that we\\'re talking about.  We call him Junior but I\\'ll tell you what, whoever they are, they, their cohorts, their younger siblings, their older siblings, they\\'re all going to pay the price and it\\'s going to be a huge price in terms of what their future is.  So my view is take the most, in a sense, the simplest way to solve Intelligence Squared U.S. - 50 - it, even though there are other solutions, I don\\'t disagree with that, that\\'s much more difficult to do.  I hope we can reform the medical system.  We have to do that.']\n",

      "[\"No, no, no.  There's just the -- the obvious example of the woman who is a better legal analyst. Of course, there's Nancy Grace who's --\", '-- my frequent opponent. [applause] How the heck did Dan Abrams, a far too old to still be single guy, not particularly known as a feminist end up writing a book about female superiority?  Did he do it to meet women?  Did he -- did he do it to pander?  You know, it\\'s always frustrating for me when I\\'m asked about a single reason why I wrote the book.  I did it for both reasons, and it\\'s worked incredibly well. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - [laughter] Now, it has not had any substantial impact on my social life, and there is no question that that sort of silliness is what has gotten my book, \"Man Down,\" far more attention than it ever would have received.  I made a case based on evidence and men\\'s rights groups and others have attacked me, saying, \"He didn\\'t use the scientific method in this book.\"  Look, this book was, at times, a fun, tongue-in-cheek effort.  So I separate it into two broad themes, chapters that at least get people reevaluating their preconceived notions and others which I think truly prove female superiority. Can I definitively prove that women are really better spies or competitive eaters or even they tolerate pain better than men for certain, or even my beloved chapter on women handling breakups better than men?  I presented evidence.  I presented studies, research.  But certainly someone on the other side could attack those chapters.  So let\\'s put the frivolous aside and talk about the evidence that examines issues that are important.  Hanna talked about women as students.  They\\'ll be better educated.  They\\'ll navigate tough economies better.  They\\'ll be better equipped for the workplace of the next generation.  But I don\\'t know.  What about politics, finance, taking care of the planet?  These are areas where the evidence is crystal clear and maybe just as important the trends for the future support women and also help explain why women lag in certain areas. Let\\'s start with politics.  Women vote more, period, both in number of votes and the percentage of the population.  In terms of registered voters in the year 2000, 61 percent of women voted.  58 percent of men.  In 2004, 65-62; 2008, with more women on the ballots, by the way, 66-62.  Same thing in midterm elections in 2010.  53 percent of those who voted were female. But wait, they, we are still tending to elect more women -- sorry, more men.  Four out of five being elected are men.  In fact, in 2010, women gained no Senate seats.  And for the first time in 30 years, lost House seats.  This is true for now.  But once the women voters and the men realize how much more effective female leaders are, it will not -- it cannot continue.  Men will be if not finished, certainly marginalized, the very first research has come out this year evaluating men and women in Congress. women won their home districts an average of $49 million more per year than their Intelligence Squared U.S. - 13 - male counterparts. Women sponsored more bills.  They cosponsored many more bills. They attracted a greater number of cosponsors than their male colleagues.  In addition, two Ohio State political science professors tracked every bill passed between 1981 and 2009 and found that those sponsored by women survived further into the legislative process, received more attention and were more likely to be deemed important overall. And as political leaders and police officers, for that matter -- you mentioned police officers -- women are less corruptible.  Two major international studies, one at the World Bank development research group, one from Williams College analyzed data from dozens of countries\\' parliaments, plus a 93-country survey.  They took a count of corruption levels within the countries.  They took a count of culture, religion, education. The results were clear. The more women legislators, the less corruption in a legislature.  So what the heck\\'s going on? Why aren\\'t there more women?  I think a 2008 Pew research study explains it all.  They surveyed 2,250 people, asked them about eight traits key to political leaders and whether they thought men or women were superior.  Honesty, overwhelmingly women; intelligence, women; hard working tied; compassionate, outgoing, creative, overwhelmingly women, women, women; ambition, tied.  The only one of the eight relevant traits where men were deemed superior, decisiveness.  In that same study, though, only six percent of the respondents felt women made better political leaders. Similar results when it came to newscasters.  A rigorous study done, male and female news casters reading the exact same message.  The participants agreed that when it came from a woman, they viewed it adds more credible.  And yet when those same people were asked, are men or women news casters more credible, they said men. There is only so long men will be able to thrive, much less survive on the fumes of past sexism and assumptions. [laughter] Now, finance.  You don\\'t need to survey the attitude of the people in finance.  2009 and 2010, Wall Street Journal and New York Times published articles entitled, \"For Mother\\'s Day, give her the reins to the portfolio\" and \"How men\\'s overconfidence hurts them as investors.\"  Both presented multiple statistics that men were taking more risks based on less information, buying and selling more often and losing more money.  Female hedge fund managers outperformed their male counterparts from 2000 to 2009 according to hedge fund research by a whopping three percent.  Business Week reported that when the downturn began, funds run by women lost 9.6 percent compared to 19 percent for men.  Yes, women are only a fraction of the hedge fund managers.  Maybe they have to work harder to get there.  Maybe these are the females who are at the top of the game. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 14 - But in the world of finance, numbers should speak for themselves.  And all other things equal, anyone who wants to make money out to go with a woman.  Finally, new studies show that women are more committed to protecting the planet.  They recycle more. They\\'re more likely to be green.  They eat less meat.  They take shorter trips.  In part because they give and follow better directions than men.  They take public transportation more.  They are also better and safer bus drivers.  They save gas by speeding less.  They make more eco purchases.  Heck, God has decided that men are finished.  Between 1995 and 2008, 82 percent of lightning strikes were on men. [laughter] So bottom line, why are women still lagging in so many areas?  Three reasons:  Married or unmarried, they\\'re still primarily responsible for childcare; two, they often lack the overconfidence of men; and three, sexism.  When number one may not ever change for certain, number two and three will. They must.  And then us men are in big trouble.

But what if I told you that there is solid evidence to demonstrate that women can defuse a violent situation better than men can?  Hmm. Okay.  Now instead of having to tackle the guy, you can get the guy to a -- you can avoid a conflict altogether and then avoid taxpayer lawsuits and have less corruption within your police force. Hmm.

When people start thinking about and hearing about and learning about how much more effective female political leaders are, for example, I think that there will be a change.  People will vote differently.  Remember, when people say to me, well, why are Intelligence Squared U.S. - 37 - there so many -- look, women should be blaming themselves with regard to voting because women are the majority of the voters out there.  But what's interesting is, when you get more female candidates, you don't necessarily get a change with regard to the voting habits of women.  So the answer to your question, is I think when it comes to newscasters, when it comes to political leaders, and I think in a lot of these other areas, in finance, I think that ultimately the results will speak for themselves.  And that's part of the reason why I think this proposition of men are finished -- you know, while certainly hyperbole, if you look at the results, it's a dangerous world upcoming, not today, a dangerous world coming for men.\", 'Just so I understand, what -- do I --', \"Yeah, look.

Again, getting back to some of the statistics that I laid out, that's as a result of risk aversion, now, that doesn't -- that means if you're going to swing for the homerun every time, you're going to hit that homerun more often and you're also going to strike out more often.

And they are simply adapting better than are men.  And that's the really important point here.  It's not just that the male jobs are being eliminated.

Both Hanna and I have talked to you in depth and at length about how significantly women have not caught up but surpassed men in very significant areas in our society.  David mentioned before that you're not going to see jock strap protests outside.  That's right.  That's part of the problem is that men are not alarmed by the situation. And that's one of the main reasons that men are finished, is they don't seem to care. [laughter] They think -- they think it's cool to be a slacker.  It's not.  Dave mentioned the Chilean mines and the miners there as an effort to sort of pull at your heartstrings.  There's no question that that was a heartfelt moment. But what if a woman had designed that mine?  I'm guessing that we might not have ever had that sort of problem. [laughter] I will end with one note from my book which is that there was a study done on how long it takes men and women to get ready to leave the house.  And this study, in England, of 2,000 people showed that men take, on average, four minutes longer.  When you think about a Saturday night, no question women will take longer to get ready to leave the house.  But when you think about the realities that women face every day of bringing up children, of working a job very often, of doing all the hard work and trying to get ready to leave the house, it starts to make sense.  And if that study's true, then men really are finished. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 64 -\"]\n",
      "[\"I was a debater, and I'm hoping I can channel that inner nerd tonight and bring it right back again.\", \"We beat everybody.  But my partner was a boy, so I don't know if that counts.\", \"I'd like to welcome you all to this debate tonight.  I'd even like to welcome the men to the debate tonight although of course I pity you. [laughter] Just kidding.  Before I dive in, I just want to say -- I just want to start with a definition. What do we mean by men are finished? We'd like you to think of this as the writing on the wall, as the sign that points to an inevitable future.  What I mean by that is that in order to win this debate, we don't have to prove that there are no male geniuses, that there's no more male CEOs, that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are figments of your imagination or that all the men are any minute going to be rounded up and locked up as -- only to be released every once in a while as sex slaves.  That would be -- that would be a preposterous standard.  Maybe it sounds good to you guys. But what we do have to prove, and what we will prove is that the world where men dominate the public sphere and where the male traits are the ones that lead to success is the world that we are currently saying goodbye to. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 5 - We are living through an unprecedented moment in history where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very radically.  I'll start with the fundamentals.  In 2010, for the first time ever, women became the majority of the work force.  This is kind of an amazing fact. As recently as the 1980s, the working woman was such a cool new sociological phenomenon that there were several sitcoms dedicated to her existence, which many of you might remember. Now she is the majority of the work force.  If you look back at your professional schools that you guys went to, law school, medical school, accounting, even business schools, you are likely to find that women are the majority of all of those schools.  And last year for the first time, women became 54 percent of all American managers. Now, how are men doing these days?  They're doing very, very badly.  The annual income of men peaked around 1973, which is just when women started to get going. Right now, one in five men are out of work, which is the highest percentage that's ever existed. When Larry Summers was recently asked by the New York Times what keeps him up at night, you would think he would have mentioned the healthcare crisis or maybe the many, many gaps he has made over his long career, but he did not mention either of those things.  What he mentioned was this one in five ratio which he described as having vast social consequences. Now, why is this happening?  The very simple answer is college.  Most economists agree that what you need to get ahead these days is pretty simple.  It's just a college degree. But women, for some reason, are much better these days at getting college degrees than men.  For every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. So why are women getting more college degrees?  It's not that women are smarter because they're not smarter.  These days, men and women test about the same on standardized tests for both math and English.  But women have something.  Some sociologists call it grit, some call it engagement, some call it focus, some call it social intelligence.  It's some special formula that's required for success these days, which women just seem to have in greater abundance than men.  And this is a very new thing. Now, I imagine that our opponents are going to concede that women do better in college.  But then they're going to say so what?  Women are goody goodies, then they go to work, and they just flame out, and they never get anywhere else.  But this is, of course, completely preposterous. Intelligence Squared U.S. - 6 - For one thing, it's only been happening for about a generation and a half, and you already see the results in the economy.  You already see that for women under 30 these days are making more money than men under 30.  And that's really, really new.  Also women are getting much more aggressive than they ever were, which is something that's brand new.  And also the qualities that we think of as making a great leader are starting to be defined as more feminine than masculine which is something that my partner is going to talk about later. So now you really have to be blind not to see the effects of this all around us in the culture. We've all gotten used to the new guy antihero or what my friend at Slate calls the omega male who's two rungs below the alpha in the wolf pack.  And so we see him in the Judd Apatow movies, we see him in the Bud Light commercials.  He's sitting around, putting his feet up, drinking beers, basically not working and not sure what to do with his life, he's still wearing Keds and a band T-shirt even though he's well into his 40s and at an age where men in generations before were already picking their kids up from college. I just spent the last couple of weeks watching the new sitcoms for the new TV season. The theme for this TV season was called by TV Guide the emasculation of men, and here again you have lots and lots of guys playing videogames while their wives work, sometimes they work double shifts, their wives are working powerhouse jobs, and they're coming home to see their husbands play videogames.  One of the guys in the sitcoms, one of the characters decided that he was going to bestow his business upon his granddaughter and not his grandson because his granddaughter had an MBA from Purdue and his grandson as he put it was a jet skiing idiot. [laughter] So this is the middle class's reflection of itself these days.  Now we're on to my favorite subject which is male vanity, the new male vanity. [laughter] Lose your guts, 30 red hot sex secrets.  Dave Zinczenko will recognize these phrases because they come from the cover of his magazine, Men's Health. [laughter] Intelligence Squared U.S. - 7 - Once upon a time men's magazines used to actively flaunt their dominance and aggression. The very first issue of Playboy called women people who crush man's adventurous free loving spirit.  These days they seem to flaunt male insecurity.  Men are fueling the rise in plastic surgery, hair products, and waxes.  If you look at the back at the 1986 Sexiest Man Alive, you'll see Mark Harmon who basically looks like an orangutan by the standards of the day, he's got hair coming out of his shoulders, coming out of his thighs, he's a really big hairy man.  These days the men are waxing and primping more than I have ever done in my entire life, as we all became deeply familiar with, unfortunately, when we have the close-up of Anthony Weiner. [laughter] Now, from my opponents, you'll likely hear a lot of talk about the new generation about how men are still geniuses, men are still inventors, how they drive the technology industry. I have a few things to say to that.  First of all, we're talking about a tiny percentage of men, and they're more than balanced out by the men at the other end who are incarcerated or having trouble in school.  It's perfectly possible that we'll have a handful of great inventors and that still broadly speaking men are finished.  You're also likely to hear about the Fortune 500 list and at the echelons of Hollywood and how few women there are out there at the top.  I hear this argument on nearly every panel that I'm on and my answer is always the same, duh, men have been at this for 40,000 years and women have only been at this for 40 years, so of course the world doesn't flip upside- down overnight.  But the writing on the wall is still clear, men are finished, which is why you should vote for us.\", \"It is possible, but it just doesnt work that way.  I mean, if we can all agree that there was male dominance for a long time and that male dominance is over, then I think we agree that men are finished.  So the resolution is about male dominance which weve taken for granted for so many tens of thousands of years. And so, even if you have parity, you have the end of male dominance.  I mean, if you have women rising and catching up to men, then you no longer have male dominance. And so that's what I meant when I, early on, tried to define the resolution as men are finished, the era of male dominance, it's finished, which we've taken for granted for all this time.\", \"Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - That's fine.

I mean, you see that women are holding up these families, they\\'re in community colleges, the men are struggling, and for some reason they\\'re not getting the message that they have to go to school. So I think we can be in one of two different places.  The men could start getting the message that they have to retool themselves, that the Intelligence Squared U.S. - 30 - factories that their fathers worked for are not going to be there anymore and that they have to do something different, and then we\\'ll end up in a situation that\\'s closer to parity. Or you could end up in a situation where it gets worse and worse and worse and the income -- you know, you have a sort of little upper class of people that these guys are talking about that consists of Bill Gates and maybe the people in this audience and not very many more people and everybody else is sort of struggling with the women holding the bag, it\\'s called the last bag theory where the woman because she\\'s raising the child is also going to school and making the money and the men are just sort of struggling and out of work.', 'Yes, yes, because what Christina is saying is proof--', 'Yes, because theyre finished.', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 32 - Well, acknowledging that this true would be the first step to helping them.

Theyve gone in a very short period of time from not being able to work when they were married to not being able to work when Intelligence Squared U.S. - 33 - they had little kids, to being able to work whenever they wanted in a vast number of professions.  I can name a number of professions that have gone from entirely male to entirely female.  And you cant name any that have gone the other way around.  Why? Because men operate in a narrower range at this point in time.  That doesnt mean that they always will, but at this point in time, theyre just not that flexible about their identities.', 'Men are languishing in all countries of the world.

So we always think -- male preference is something that comes up a lot.  You know, preference for the first born son.  One of the first things I did when I started this research was, on a lark and a tip, I went to go visit fertility clinics because, you know, we all understand that people prefer sons.  And it turns out that, no, 75 percent of couples are actually requesting girls.  So then I started to ask, well, is this true in these very patriarchal places like South Korea, China and India?  Well, you look at the charts, and here's what happened.  At some point, technology allowed them, you know, to easily choose a son.  And then by the mid '90s, this plummeted.  Women started to go to school.  Women started to get jobs that they could never have before.  And all these strict patriarchal structures started to break down.  So you can see all over the world that different things are happening. I mean, China, for example, has a higher percentage of female CEOs than the U.S. does. Why?  I think it's because childcare is easier.  I think it's because families take care of children. There's all sorts of reasons why culturally that's true.\", 'Eventually.', 'Intelligence Squared U.S. - 35 - Well, the difference is when you poll them and ask them what they want, they say we want a son.

Now, female feelings about what's okay as a woman, and people have measured this for college students and adults have changed radically.  Women now think it's much more okay to be aggressive in the workplace. It's much more okay to win.  They ask a series of questions.  The male identification hasn't -- self-identification hasn't changed basically in 60 years. Men always think it's only acceptable to be a guy in this tiny, narrow range.

That's why I'm always reluctant to enter into this gender biology question:  Women are like this, and men are like this.  Women have gotten vastly more aggressive.  They are -- they're much, much more likely to get arrested, especially juvenile females than they were 20 years ago. You know, so this is a sort of scale that moves along a continuum.\", 'Though, as I said --', \"Yeah.  I mean, they don't have to fire all of their males, but they certainly have to -- [laughter] -- fire most of them.\", \"No, that's not where I was going with that.\", \"I'm not touching that.  I have three children.  I just like to brag about that.  I'm not going near that one.  Dave and Dan, you can take that one.\", 'Yeah, no, if we look at --', \"-- if we look at this from the children's perspective and the children in this sort of 59 percent that I was talking about, we would definitely win and you would definitely have to vote for men are finished.  It's like a shocking phenomenon, 40 percent of American children are now born to single parent households.  You could say that's because the women have decided that the men are finished, they don't need them, they don't contribute to the household, the women are the ones doing all the work and going to school and the men are just sort of another child in the house to feed and that's what all the women tell me. [laughter] I wish that it was funny but it's not funny.  That's the part of this that's the tragedy about men are finished.\", \"There are women managers -- there -- 54 percent of American managers are now women, they don't need that much help on that.\", 'Yes.', 'Im going to start out by reading you a couple of quotes.  One is from a story called, The Decline of the American Male.  Men, this writer says, are endangered species.  They are expendable.  Another quote: Women have gained in the past century while men have fallen behind.  Who is this mystery author?  Dave Zinczenko is the mystery author who wrote this story at USA Today in 2009.  He keeps saying this is preposterous, this is preposterous.  Merely two years ago, he thought that it was true.  Now Im going to read you another series of quotes. It is boys who are the second sex.  Its a bad time to be a boy in America.  The research -- listen to this closely -- commonly cited to support claims of male privilege and male sinfulness is riddled with errors. Who is the mystery author of this article?  Christina Hoff Sommers, whos also saying that this is all very preposterous.  So, as you can see, its not that preposterous.  We can all see the writing on the walls.  They keep talking about how men are still running the country.  Men are still doing this, men are still doing that.  But that\\'s not interesting. That just shows a lack of imagination. As we said, this \"Men are finished\" proposition, you literally have to think of it as graffiti, as the writing on the wall pointing to an inevitable future.  All the signs are there. So -- and then the final thing I want to say is, Christina says this is a vote for chauvinism, that \"Men are finished\" is a vote for chauvinism. Don\\'t think of it that way.  You\\'re actually doing a public service to men if you vote for our team because I think if we finally acknowledge that this is a problem and that men are finished and that they need our help, and they might even need some affirmative action, then maybe we would behave the right way, and we would help the men who desperately need our help.

      "['I do.', \"Thank you. [applause] Peter Bergen: First of all, Juliette and I wanted to acknowledge the three and a half decades of public service that General Hayden has done and also Richard Falkenrath's more than a decade of public service. I also wanted to acknowledge Juliette Kayyem's decade and a half of public service where she became the highest ranking Arab-American in the Obama administration, the assistant secretary to the Department of Homeland Security.  She also had three kids that she raised at the same time, putting home into Homeland Security in a meaningful sense -- [laughter] Peter Bergen: -- and is one of the world's leading experts on the question of homeland security.  My own connection to the story came when the Trade Center was bombed for the first time in '93.  I traveled to Afghanistan, produced a documentary about the threat we face from Afghanistan and then, of course, interviewed bin Laden. I've written three books on the subject of Al-Qaeda.  I've embedded with our troops on multiple occasions in Iraq and Afghanistan. From a self-interested point of view, I have every incentive to say the threat that Al-Qaeda and terrorism poses to us remains very serious.  And it merits on open-ended conflict against them; but in good conscience, I simply can't make that argument. War is no longer the most appropriate way to look at the problems we face today.  Our singular focus on terrorism also masks many more pressing problems.  Our crumbling infrastructure, our decaying schools, deeply serious economic problems. Another national security problem is managing the future of the Arab Spring, for instance; preventing nuclear war between Pakistan and India; preventing a nuclear war between North Korea and South Korea; managing the rise of China which, while weve been distracted by the War on Terror, has quietly expanded its influence in Africa and in Southeast Asia. Our opponents want to prolong the War on Terror, an open-ended conflict against a tactic that is already America's longest war.  We're saying it's time for war to end. President Obama correctly redefined this conflict downwards from a global open-ended conflict against the tactic to the more precise formulation of a war against Al-Qaeda and its allies, which both names the enemy and narrows the focus of the conflict. When we say it's time for the War on Terror to end, we don't mean we should precipitously pull out of Afghanistan, but we do mean that it's time to stop conceiving our principle national security goal as the defeat of terrorists when putting, for instance, our own economic house in order will do far more to prepare us for the next real war we'll inevitably face at some point in the future. The War on Terror, as everybody in the audience knows, has caused the American public at least a trillion dollars in expenditure and wars around the world and, of course, got us into the catastrophic Iraq War; further trillions on our -- both our Intelligence and Homeland National Security apparatus resulted in policies such as coercive interrogations and extraordinary renditions. And you'll hear from my partner that the government has for years anyway moved away from the War on Terror and what it entails, not because there was no threat.  We're not claiming that at all but because the threat has changed and has adapted and so we must -- we as well. Key American National Security officials now say that Al-Qaeda's on its last leg.  John Brennan, who, of course, is President Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, said that just last week. Leon Panetta said that the strategic defeat of Al-Qaeda is within sight. General David Petraeus has made the same sort of comments recently.  None of these gentlemen can be considered to be defeatist or soft on terrorism.  So is this premature triumphalism the claim that Al-Qaeda is on its last legs?  Well, I think the claim is well-justified.  I mean, the leadership of Al-Qaeda's been completely decimated in the campaign of drone attacks. The most dangerous job in the world right now has been Al-Qaeda's number two.  There have been about 20 of them since 2008, including most recently, the group's number two out here, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was killed just a few weeks -- just about a week ago. Al-Qaeda hasn't carried out a successful attack in the West since the 7/7 attacks in London six years ago.  Al-Qaeda hasn't killed a single American in the United States since 9/11. And think about the real wars we've really confronted.  The Civil War threatened to tear this country apart.  World War II, we defeated an enemy that instigated a global conflict to kill tens of millions, and if the Cold War had ended with a bang instead of whimper, we'd all be not in this debate because we'd all be dead. Those are serious threats. The War on Terror -- the threat we faced from Al-Qaeda doesn't come close; and in fact, only 17 Americans have died as a result of Al-Qaeda's ideological ideas in this country, 13 of them, of course, at Fort Hood and others in other places. More Americans accidentally die in their own bathtubs every year by considerable numbers around 300, and we don't have an unreasonable fear of bathtubs; so we shouldn't have an unreasonable fear of Al-Qaeda. [laughter] Peter Bergen: And by terrorism [unclear], we're terrified, by the way, of course, and we're doing the job of the terrorist for them if we live in this state of constant fear that our opponents wish us to live in. And everybody in the audience knows very well that the threat from terrorism is actually dramatically receded in the years since the 9/11 attacks; and that's in part because Al-Qaeda and bin Laden have been losing the war of ideas in the Muslim world for years. Their founder and leader was killed, as you know, in Abbottabad on the evening of May 1st.  In the Arab Spring, there's not a single revolutionary who's carrying a single picture of Osama bin laden. Bin Laden's ideas have been completely absent from the Arab Spring.  There hasn't been a single flag burning in the Arab Spring of an American flag or even an Israeli flag; so bin Laden's foot soldiers, ideas and leadership are simply absent from this enormously important phenomenon in the Arab world. Our opponents may claim that we're still threatened by terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction.  This claim, of course, follows simply the disastrous war in Iraq; and in fact, the 188 jihadi terrorist cases in this country since 9/11, not a single one of them involved chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. We will no doubt hear from our opponents that to argue the War on Terrorism is overly soft or unrealistic or weak -- and they make claim that, at some point, we will decide we no longer need to define it as a War on Terror, but we aren't there yet. I would submit to you in the audience, if the death of the founder and leader of Al-Qaeda isn't the point where we can say the War on Terror is over and then add to that the destruction of almost its entire top leadership, its absence in the revolutions across the Middle East, its inability to mount any kind of attack on the United States for a decade isn't the point to end the War on Terror, when will that point be? We say it's now. [applause]\", \"Well, there's a very substantial difference between it --\", \"I mean, sure, there was often -- when, in Bin Laden's house, in Abbottabad, or after all these blue sky plans to attack us on the 10th anniversary of 9/11.  I think I can tell you right now, that's not going to happen.  These were blue sky plans.  These were kind of doodlings of a guy was basically spending five years with his three wives, with not much to do -- and thinking about, you know, like, some sort of grotesque parody of a Dr. No James Bond, sort of sitting there, coming up with -- plotting mayhem.  But these were not, you know, the government itself -- DHS -- has said you know, that you know, these were -- there was nothing there then.  There was no operation.  He was essentially somebody who history had sidelined. You know, President Obama has said something I think is quite accurate.  He's a small man on the wrong side of history.  And history just sped up for them, with the Arab Spring and the death of Bin Laden.  And for us to sort of live in a state of constant fear that they're going to do something to us is to basically hand them a victory that they didn't even have --\", '-- when he was alive.', \"Well, I'm glad that General Hayden has conceded that, certainly, our principal enemies are dead. I mean, that's usually how you end a war, when your enemies are mostly dead.  We didn't kill every Nazi at the end of World War II.  I mean, there's a certain point.  What we're claiming here is it's time to end the War on Terror as the organizing principle of our national security policy, which by the way, cost us trillions of dollars over the past decade -- which has allowed us to ignore a lot of serious problems we have at home and other threats abroad.  You know, there are a million Americans now with top secret clearances.  I don't think they all needed them. That is one of the legacies of defining it as a War on Terror. And Richard said that we're not debating the War on Terror as it was produced by President George Bush in the first four years.  Well, I mean, let's try and take that back to our side a little bit.  The War on Terror was not the war on Al-Qaeda and its allies.  It was an open-ended conflict against a tactic that produced a lot of enormous problems for this country, including the Iraq War and all that, the legacy we have from that.  And so, there is sort of historical part to this.  It's important.  We're not just debating about what happened today.  It's about a mindset which causes countries some serious economic problems -- which we are still trying to recover from.\", 'They are two factual arguments to make the case.', 'Well --', \"-- as sort of another way to look at this is that President Clinton tried to kill Bin Laden in 1998, with cruise missile strikes.  This is not new, the idea that we reserve to ourselves the ability to kill enemies of the state.  Well, we're just calling for an end of this all-encompassing, global conflict that has cost us so much money.  We're not calling for a global police action against terrorists, certainly.  We reserve the right for a certain kind of war-like activities, but it's time to stop this sort of grandiose approach, where we're at war with any person who's ever said the word Jihad around the world, which is going to cost us a lot of money.\", \"Well, I think when we say, The War on Terror,  when FDR went to war against the Nazis, he didn't declare war against the sort of tactic of U-Boats or kamikaze pilots, in the case of Japan.  I mean, the War on Terror was a very expansive notion that pulled us into the conflicts in the Iraq -- that we now orphaned -- and others.  And that's what we're saying  it is the end of that.  I mean, Juliette is making a point that it's, in a sense, already ended.  But also, our enemies are essentially defeated.  And defeat doesn't mean total obliteration.  It means that we can now move on and say, essentially, that the longest war in American history, which it is now, the longest war in American history. You know, there's a time -- a time to move on.\", 'Well, I think we do know. [laughter]', \"Well, they were related to each other, I mean, that's -- the way -- the way the war was sold is that it was part of the war on terror.  That was the intellectual architecture of the war.\", \"Well, we're still in Iraq.\", 'Can I just --', \"Well, I mean, it's a factual matter that we spent --\", \"-- a trillion dollars at least in Iraq, right? I mean, we're -- by winding down there and no longer part of the war on terror there, we're going to save ourselves a lot of money.  As a factual matter, we spent half a trillion dollars on our intelligence.  I think Juliette would have a better answer on how much we spend on our Homeland Security. We spend a huge amount of money on this, and we can't afford it right now. And clearly there is some belt tightening that is needed, and if we stopped having this [unclear] construct on the war on terror it would help making the hard decisions that we need to make about reducing the size of our bloated  I mentioned the fact that there are a million Americans with top-secret clearances.  Thats not secret.  Top secret.  I dont think that all these people really need these top secret clearances.  We are facing a group of people that on a good day may now number 300 or 400.\", 'Well, are going to have to reduce the number of people in our Intelligence apparatus.  We are going to have to reduce the number of people, if we are going to draw down in Afghanistan and Iraq, and by saying that the War on Terror is over, thats going to help those decisions.', 'I think the Taliban has to be made irrelevant, and the Taliban to a large degree is becoming less relevant in Afghanistan over time. I think what were looking at, if we pull out for a little bit -- there are still Marxist-Leninists somewhere in the United States on some college campus somewhere.  Just no one pays any attention to them.  And you know, were at the point where al-Qaeda and its ideas and weve included that in the Taliban, which, by the way, enjoys only a seven percent favorable rating in Afghanistan right now.  Theres nothing like living under the Taliban as a prophylactic to their ideas about creating a utopia here on earth, dont make sense.  So these ideas are becoming irrelevant, and thats why the War on Terror should be ended.  Weve just heard from Rich that he wont even tell us when the war will end.  Well, if it doesnt end with the founder and leader of al-Qaeda, the intellectual author of 9/11, which is the reason we went to war in Afghanistan in the first place, the fact the Taliban wouldnt hand him over -- if it doesnt end when its totally irrelevant in the Middle East, if it doesnt end when its the war of ideas in the Muslim World, if it doesnt end when its entire top leadership is decimated, I mean, when does it end?', 'My last appearance at this debate forum was arguing that the war in Afghanistan was something to continue, with Max Boot.  He is also here in the audience.  I think it would be difficult for me to now change my mind and in such a public fashion. And I think that we, you know, we -- there are things that we, you know, making sure that Afghanistan doesnt revert into a haven for the Taliban and a lot of groups is, you know, that is a very good thing.  You know, it was the War on Terror kind of construct that got into a war which cost us a lot more in blood and treasure where we were not attacked from, which, of course, was Iraq.', \"Well, as Juliette said and I've said, I mean, we're not opposed to conducting continuing our presence in Afghanistan and making sure that it doesn't revert into a safe haven - -\", \"Well, it's a war against al-Qaeda and its allies.  The president, President Obama, correctly redefined downwards this open-ended global conflict against the tactic and named the enemy. And that's the enemy that we continue to fight.\", 'Weve heard from Rich tonight that al-Qaeda isn\\'t 10 feet tall and also it\\'s a manageable problem but also that we should be at war against this terrorism tactic until the 22nd century, and that there\\'s no circumstances that he can define tonight when we should declare the end of this war.  And as we were thinking about this question, we turned to two of the leading experts on terrorism in the world for some counsel, one of them said, we here in the United States certainly are much safer. Al-Qaeda still exists but it\\'s been massively damaged.  Through nine years of an onslaught against them, our defensive abilities here in the country, our intelligence, our law enforcement, our Homeland Security is much better, so there\\'s no question the United States is safer.  The second leading expert said just a few weeks ago, future attacks are going to be more numerous but less complex, less well organized, less well likely to succeed, and less lethal if they do succeed.  I think the killing of bin Laden will accelerate that change.  The first expert was Richard Falkenrath speaking to CNN almost exactly a year ago. And the second expert was General Hayden speaking to the Associated Press this summer after the death of bin Laden.  We agree with both these gentlemen that al-Qaeda has been massively damaged and that theres no question that were safer and that this much weakened al-Qaeda is far less likely to succeed with even small-bore attacks it will try and pull off in the future and that this process of al-Qaeda decline has been accelerated with the death of their leader.  And for these reasons, and because we agree with these gentlemen, and others weve outlined this evening, we urge you to vote for the motion that \"It\\'s time to end the War on Terror. [applause]']\n",
      "['So, I mean, there\\'s just been tremendous change over these 10 years; and so calling it a War on Terror for them does not help them manage budget or defend certain programs or know actually how to prioritize. As Rich Falkenrath -- who helped institutionalize the phrase \"dual-use\" policies that help the cop on the street in fighting crime as well as in counterterrorism; that provide training for emergency managers for a tower falling as well as Hurricane Irene -- these are the most sustainable and effective. The color-code system seemed appropriate in an era that created a warlike climate but provided no clarity to the first responders on how to -- how to react, and the public rightfully rejected it. More localized efforts to engage immigrant communities or in nationally adopting to \"See Something, Say Something\" campaign that came out of New York City are good and effective government action, and they are necessary as we have reason to be concerned with radicalization in our own nation. None of these require military engagement or mind-set although, of course, as I\\'ve said, there might be a need for military engagement, and it\\'s authorized by law.  These are smart strategies adopted by people across the ideological spectrum. I am here not because I have some invested intellectual interest in saying the war is over. Military efforts will need to be utilized.  That goes without saying.  But do not forget what the War on Terror was, and do not forget how much progress we have made in moving past it. What has replaced it is a different way of thinking about the threat and our response.  Surely, not everything is perfect, but criticism is accepted.  There is nothing soft or weak or liberal about believing the War on Terror is over.  It is actually the way the world is; and ask yourself \"Are we less safe now from having moved on?\" [applause]', 'Okay, okay --', \"-- I'm a lawyer, and let me tell you what the AUMF says.  Because I agree with it.  And I agree with them.  I thought the question was, should the War on Terror continue?  So, I didn't bring my legal books.  But if you want to view the War on Terror as solely a legal issue -- the authorization for the use of military force is because of a debate between -- hard to imagine that they actually debated this after September 11th -- is limited to Al-Qaeda and its affiliates. And it gives the President authorization to use a whole bunch of tools -- including military action -- but a whole bunch of them, to fight Al-Qaeda -- those responsible for 9/11 -- and its affiliates. That's what it does.  And that is great.  And we should continue to support it.\", \"But under that not everything was done under the AUMF.  First of all, this notion of a War on Terror justified -- and we can get into a legal argument.  And I did this for a while, so I'm happy to get into a legal argument. The Authorization for the Use of Military Force was limited  both in terms of its target, and did not initiate a War on Terror.  But let's also not forget their legal analysis.  Their legal analysis -- if you want to talk law -- was actually that because it was a War on Terror, Congress in many ways could not limit the President's authority in a number of items that we can remember -- that we can all go through.  So, if we're going to debate law, let's debate the law as they interpreted it. But we're not here to debate law, because that's not why -- that's --\", '-- too easy.', \"It's too easy to debate the law, because then, actually, I'm on their side.  Then I shouldn't have shown up.\", 'He is saying that.  Yeah.', \"I think that's a weird way to put the War on Terror, only because what followed from calling it a War on Terror -- which was not my language.  I mean, that was the language of an administration that determined that after 9/11, we would conceive of it at as war.  And it would have all sorts of implications -- not just legal implications, but implications for a whole range of activities, because we were going to call it a war. And all the -- so, it wasn't just a feeling.  It was a series of procedures and policies that flowed from that.  So let me just give you an example, because that may help -- what this legal debate means.  So by deciding that it's a War on Terror.  So, that's what it is.  This is the debate about military commissions.  What do we mean by military commissions? Well, if it's a War on Terror, that is this thing that we can define and determine where we want to go with detainees or how we want to try or not try them.  Then, we create a whole new military commission system that, under the previous administration, got essentially overturned by the Supreme Court.  And then you have to come back, right?  And then you have to say, What are we going to do with these detainees?  Because it's a problem.  We all agree it's a problem.  And then you come back, and you work with Congress, and you create a military commission -- which this president did -- which provides very strong protections for the people within the military commission system, has independent appellate review -- and let's just be clear, has been supported by every Article III court, every federal court in the United States. We're not at a constitutional crisis every day.  We're just not there. So, it wasn't our language.  It was the language of the AUMF -- authorization for the use of military force against Al-Qaeda and its affiliates.  Wasn't our language.  So to say now, that we're calling it a feeling seems like it's just a little bit of amnesia there, I think.\", 'Right.', 'Right.', \"A couple things on what Rich says.  This argument is actually -- if you read it -- is about the War on Terror.  And it's not a referendum on the first four years of the Bush Administration, or the first six years, or even the first two of Obama.  It is about, what did we mean by the War on Terror?  What was that definition that was used for so many years?  And are we ready to be over?  And they are doing -- they are trying to convince you, sort of a simplistic notion here, which is -- for those of us who have also served in government and national security is way too simplistic, simply because you want to say that the War on Terror is over does not mean that you're saying, No military action ever.  Right?  It doesn't mean, Oh, gosh, I wish Bin Laden had been brought to a courtroom in New York City.  No one is saying that. There is authority for the President to use force, including killing Bin Laden, under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force.  I support that.\", \"Well, I think it's already over.  So let me then -- that's a great question.  Because what also happened over the course of this 10 year period is that a narrative is being rewritten.  And the narrative is that Obama is exactly the same as Bush.  But Bush wasn't exactly the same as Bush. We have grown.  And there are examples everywhere -- coercive interrogation, the black site -- all of that, we have learned.  They learned, we learned.  And that ability to change doesn't mean that, you know, Oh, you know, We're going to continue to call it the same thing.  That war ended.  That notion that military or this War on Terror was how we were going to approach it.  It became much better.  And can we talk about Homeland Security for a minute?\", \"Because they're never going to end it.\", \"Right?  The 10th anniversary is a good sign to begin to say, Let's give, -- have the American public say, We're ready to not think of our world this way.  That the War on --\", 'Completely --', 'Right.', '[inaudible]', 'Could you just say that last part again?  If the war  Philip Gourevitch: What would be gained by ending the war on terror, as you define it? Juliette Kayyem: Honesty, descriptiveness, actually reflecting what\\'s happening out there.  I mean, whether the war on terror ended as we started to change, it\\'s just a learning process over 10 years, to effective counterterrorism -- effective counterterrorism tools.  That happened over the course of a 10 year period.  So the reason why not to call it a war on terror is because we know what the war on terror meant.  Now, they can now claim it was just a legal device. But I lived that time.  We all lived that time.  We all served in government.  Three of us served in government during that time.  So I\\'ve just asked people to remember, as we have been discussing, what that meant.  It\\'s not an indictment on everything that happened or the changes or whatever else.  It is just simply today we have effective counterterrorism measures. Some of them might be military, might be the use of military force as authorized by law. Many of them will not be.  And it\\'s as simple as that.  And so we can say that we didn\\'t mean by the \"War on Terror\" anything but there\\'s this law.  And that\\'s just for you all to decide if that\\'s what you thought it meant at that time.', 'Okay.', 'Right. Philip Gourevitch: But the concept of the war on terror should be because of a bunch of things that you say have essentially -- Juliette Kayyem: Been changed. Philip Gourevitch: -- not been practiced for a while so -- Juliette Kayyem: Right. Philip Gourevitch: -- it seems like you think it should be redefined. Juliette Kayyem: And, but -- and there\\'s a reason for -- Philip Gourevitch: And I\\'m asking what would be gained by saying \"The war on terror is over,\" and wouldn\\'t -- if you\\'re still preserving all those legal tools -- Juliette Kayyem: Right. Philip Gourevitch: -- that you think that they -- that they said that we should. Juliette Kayyem: Not all of them, yeah.  No.  I think in answering in terms, I think more descriptive of actually what we\\'re doing, more limited description of what counterterrorism efforts and procedures actually are.  There\\'s a difference between counterterrorism efforts and actions and war.  And it\\'s ', '-- be descriptive in that sense.', \"Well, then that's my -- I viewed the war on terror as so expansive and defining so many authorities, including a commander in chief by all -- any means necessary to protect us. That explains a 10-year or eight-year trajectory.  I'm not going back to say, oh, look how horrible they are.  I'm going back to say, that's what the war on terror was.  Aren't we glad that we have moved away from that?  They moved away from it.  We moved away from it.\", 'Oh.', \"I just don't know --\", \"I just don't know how -- I mean, first of all, with all due respect, General Hayden, I think no one is arguing that al-Qaeda -- no one in authority or who has to deal with dealing with the security apparatus or figuring out how to distribute funds that are drying up, because that's what you know in particular Homeland Security, that's what state and locals are dealing with, that's what police departments are dealing with, how do I prioritize the threat out there when everyone wants to be safe not just from terrorism but from crime and whatever else may go on. So no one is arguing that we're closing the door to acknowledgement of a threat of terror, and it's just not the debate.  And so they're sort of throwing up a bunch of straw men against this typical notion of people who want the American public to acknowledge, and maybe it happened two years ago with the election of Obama -- growing recognition that war and what war meant was not the way to describe what we were doing. And General Hayden talks about this consensus that we want all the tools in the toolbox, but to remind you -- the consensus was not a consensus because the President decided it was a consensus.  It took Congress, the courts, the public, leaders within the Bush administration, and, yes, a new president, to realize that this construct that we had created over the course of six, eight, or 10 years needed to be thought about in a different way.  And that's what we're asking of you, not saying, throw in the towel, let bin Laden, hang out with his wives, that is not what we're saying and it's a disservice to people who want to challenge this notion of the war on terror to caricature us that way.\", 'I would actually totally agree with Rich on this point.  I think that the changes that were made over the course of the 10 years, not because we had to call it a war but these are actually statutory changes made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act have brought about tremendous changes within both the law enforcement intelligence community, local law enforcement and whatever else. So I actually would agree with -- I think were all sort of -- there are a variety of tools that can be used by any present executive branch member or whatever else to counter al-Qaeda and to defeat al-Qaeda.', \"How'd that go? Male Speaker: Didn't go so well.  I just don't understand exactly what it is that you think -- should President Obama give a speech and -- Juliette Kayyem: We're not -- we're not -- Male Speaker: -- declare victory? Juliette Kayyem: Well, so here's --\", \"-- what's so interesting about this.  We're not asking for a -- this war is over.  I mean, if anything, I hope that the description of the last year showed this may be a bit too late, not to criticize Intelligence Squared, that I actually think without you knowing it, we did end the war on terror and that in trying to expose how we ended it, it's -- and what the reason for discussing it in such an open manner is because how we talk about counterterrorism measures, whether it's killing Bin Laden or it's bringing someone to an article 3 court, or it's working with Arab and Muslim communities so that they will feel comfortable with the NYPD and tell them when there might be extremists amongst their midst, certainly the NYPD has been great at. But we're -- so that is an acknowledgment of the reality of where we are, because it affects how we perceive ourselves.  It clearly affects how everyone else perceives us in the outside world. And the war on terror is not a benign statement.  We've been sitting here hearing, oh, yes, we may have gone too far, and maybe this war --  it wasn't benign.  And so maybe part of our obligation 10 years later is to admit it's not a benign term.\", 'Why  would I not recommend that?', 'And because the politics --', \"Let me tell you why he wouldn't, because it took me nine months to move 19 Massachusetts National Guard members from the Pilgrim facility, because the war on terror is not benign, because this notion of the war on terror, it has completely limited our politicians' capacity to move.  And I think the amazing thing about this president is how much he has moved us.\", \"Right?  So if I think it would be bad political advice, and he should fire me if I told -- in the same way, you know, if I told him to say the war on terror is over, not because I think it's inaccurate but because I actually think that politically we -- that the public and the way we talk about it gives no opportunity for the kinds of changes, the little changes I had to make or the big changes that have been made.\", 'So you agree that its over.', 'Isnt that what youre saying?  You are admitting -- you are also admitting that it would be political suicide for anyone to say it.  And all Im saying is, maybe we can create a space where thats not true.  Where we can move 19 Massachusetts National Guard Members, or we can create more stringent military commissions, or we can close the black sites or whatever it is that we need to do, and thats actually a good thing because it means weve changed over 10 years.', 'This narrative of consensus was not a consensus --', \"-- necessarily of choice, right?  I mean, let's not forget --  it's not like all these like really smart people sat in a room and go, okay, well maybe we're excessive then, but now we're going to be all Kumbaya and figure out how to do this right.  It was a consensus because the Bush administration lost a lot in court, because Congress required them to make changes and that lasted into the Obama administration.  Because their own national security experts, including interrogators, people in the military justice system, lawyers in the Department of Justice who didn't like the secret surveillance were rebelling.  This was not -- so I'm glad that there's a consensus, but it's just -- I challenge this notion that -- ask you to remember that this sort of came about because, in all actuality, every smart person thinks the same.\", \"So it's very, very difficult decisions.\", 'So General Hayden and Rich Falkenrath, I want to thank you both and thank you both for your service and this audience as well.  They would have you believe that we simply want to repackage something, and they would have you believe that we would want to throw away laws that would have given Obama the authority to kill bin Laden.  And they want you to believe that theres this continuity of behavior over the course of the 10 years.  And none of that is true. And I actually think none of it is true because, one, were not saying throw away the laws, throw away the authorization for the use of military force, nor is the War on Terror a benign statement.  It is neither descriptive anymore nor is it benign. And the continuity has actually been one of the -- I think whats happened over the last 10 years has been sort of remarkable because it was not continuous, that what you saw over time was the American public, Congress, the courts, the Supreme Court several times, the Bush administration itself with its own internal conflicts, and a change in leadership between the presidents, show that it wasnt continuous.  Its not just the excesses that I said.  It was actually what made us better, what made our counterterrorism measures better.  And they got better over time, so that all sorts of things are not happening because of this learning curve.  So now were supposed to wake up 10 years later and say, Okay, well, that was -- it was good we called it that and lets just continue calling it that because that was -- its benign, or, its just a legal matter.  And all were asking you to do is actually think about that a little bit differently. Remember the 10 years, be grateful for the work of both administrations, but also realize the war on terror as a unifying force is no longer accurate or benign.  Thank you. [applause]']\n",

      "[\"You're not going to hear any secrets from me, John.\", \"Thank you, very much. [applause] Michael Chertoff: First, let me again thank you for inviting us to this debate.  I think it's a critical issue for the country. I'm delighted to be on the same stage with such distinguished scholars and authors.  I think, though, if I'm not mistaken, that the other side has essentially conceded the proposition for which we are arguing, and that proposition is that freedom of the press has to give way to state secrets.  Now, nobody is arguing that the proposition means everything that the government has in its possession is a state secret, nor are we arguing that simply having a single public official asserting that something is a state secret ends the analysis.  But I think where the dispute has come down to is who actually makes the decision.  Is it the government and the government process, which is what our contention is and our proposition is, or is it the press.  Does the press get the final say?  Now, I will agree with Professor Dershowitz that in the first instance, the right way to deal with this problem is for the government to control its own secrets. And most of the time, the government succeeds in doing so.  Although the press is constantly making the argument that as a matter of law, they ought to have access to those secrets.  And those arguments are relatively routinely rebuffed.  But the reality is that there are times people do leak secrets.  And sometimes they do it for what they may conceive to be noble motives. Sometimes they do it for purposes of settling scores or personal advancement.  And sometimes they do it perhaps because they want to hurt the United States.  And in those instances, it is not enough to say that because the government has failed to keep the secret, the secret ought to become public and ought to be published widely.  National security and human life cannot be the subject of a cat and mouse game.  And so I would argue that actually the existing system, which does require freedom of the press to give way to genuine state secrets is pretty much the correct balance.  How does that work? Well, first of all, if the press wants to get a secret in the possession of the government, it's very difficult to do so.  And there's a very strong presumption against simply open access to very significant classified material.  But we do have cases where the material gets out. And there, I believe the law allows, if the facts are there and the intent is there, a prosecution to take place as a way of deterring somebody from publishing that secret. And that's in fact what the law basically is.  There are statutes in the books that permit those prosecutions.  When the courts have been confronted with those prosecutions, and those are relatively rare cases, the courts have upheld the principles of those prosecutions. Even in the Pentagon papers case, at least five of the justices and probably seven, indicated that there were instances where a prosecution might be appropriate even if not in that particular case. And even with respect to prior restraint, the issuance of an injunction to prevent publication, most of the justices on the court have acknowledged in the case of a very strong and dangerous release of information, for example, the proverbial publication of information about the movement of a troop ship, it would be appropriate to rejoin the publication of that material.  And that's because the courts recognize that in the government process, a combination of executive action, congressional action and judicial action is the best mechanism for balancing between state secrets and freedom of the press.  Now, the press often argues we ought to be the judges. And the difficulty is that the press is sometimes a flawed judge of what is in the public interest. First of all, the press is not a monolith.  As Professor Dershowitz pointed out, we're not concerned about The New York Times.  We're worried about people who blog.  But the First Amendment doesn't distinguish between The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and al Manar, which is the news organ of Hezbollah. Or extreme blogs on the right or the left.  All of those are part of the press.  Nor do we want to have the government start to license particular organs as organs that can be trusted and organs that can't be trusted.  The fact is if we say that state secrets have to give way to the press when the press gets hold of them, then we mean it has to be any member of the press, a blogger, a Hezbollah journalist, somebody who works for a news organ run by the government of a foreign country.  And I don't think any of us believe that would be prudent or safe.  Is the press right even when we deal with the venerable institutions that we're so familiar with?  Well, the press sometimes also makes mistakes. Several years ago, there was a publication by The New York Times.  I know David Sanger knows about this, of information about a program that allowed the United States government to see what was going on in the financial transactions that were being executed through a program known as Swift. And this was critical in tracking the flow of money that was used to support terrorist activity. Precisely one of the recommendations that was made by the 9/11 commission against the very strong request of the Bush administration, that material was published. And the original argument was, well, this is something people need to know about because it's potentially illegal or requires some kind of oversight.  But what emerged after a period of time is it was completely legal and that there was nothing wrong about it, and nobody's privacy had been improperly invaded.  Everything was done according to an appropriate process.  And therefore, the public ombudsman of The New York Times had to write a retraction.  He had to write a piece in the Times saying that while he had originally endorsed the publication of the Swift material, he had changed his mind, and it was not appropriate because it turned out that there was nothing wrong with it, and there was no powerful interest served in releasing that material. And then he made an interesting and telling confession, that he had originally endorsed the disclosure because he didn't like the administration and the way the administration was treating the paper.  And I suggest to you that that's the problem with having the press make the decision.  The press is no more in a position to separate itself from its interests than anybody else.  But unlike the organs of government which are accountable to the public and to each other, the press is accountable to nobody.  And that's why I strongly urge you to support the proposition that we're advocating tonight.  Thank you very much. [applause]\", \"First of all, I respect David, and I certainly don't want to suggest he should ever put himself in harms way.  But I think the answer to that is yes.  Most of the issues which David has talked about can be written about without getting into matters that are state secrets. First of all, there are times that information is declassified or becomes available from other sources and doesn't need to be entered into in great detail.  But to give you an example of something that I would argue you shouldn't be able to do, is in the run-up to the bin Laden raid that resulted in eliminating bin Laden, obviously, it was a compelling public story.  And the fact that we were going to be invading another sovereign country and taking military and fatal action against an individual who had not been tried or convicted was a big issue.  I think it was a good idea, but others might have disagreed. And yet had that been leaked in advance, had it gotten into the hands of the press, I would argued it would be quite appropriate for the government to say to David Sanger, If you publish that, we will prosecute you, and perhaps we will even enjoin you from publishing it.\", 'Absolutely.', 'But, see, I think this is the point.  The point is -- and I don\\'t think we have to argue that simply calling something a state secret ends the analysis.  What\\'s important is whether it\\'s in The New York Times or Hezbollah press or somebody else. If they are in an area where they are dealing with material that is classified and sensitive, they have to make a judgment.  Now, there\\'s a certain amount of uncertainty.  And I understand that may have a chilling effect.  But that chilling effect is what imposes a sense of responsibility.  And let me say, everybody in the world who exercises power and authority, lives with the possibility that if they guess wrong, they\\'re going to wind up in trouble, including, for example, CIA agents who find themselves being investigated, and yet nobody says they should be immune from the possibility of investigation. Alan Dershowtiz: I just think you\\'re wrong empirically.  I think you\\'re wrong empirically.  It\\'s not the fact that people are guessing wrong.  Seymour Hersh isn\\'t guessing.  He knows he\\'s not being prosecuted because he\\'s revealing a secret that you -- not you personally -- but somebody in the administration gave him on the sly.  They say that, \"We know it\\'s classified, but please print this because it makes us look good.  And if you print it, you won\\'t be prosecuted.\"  The end result is that people only feel chilled when they release secrets that make the administration look bad. When they reveal secrets that make the administration look good, they are not going to be prosecuted.  I\\'ll give you an example.  I\\'m a supporter of the Obama administration.  I think they handled the post-Osama bin Laden killing miserably.  What did they do?  They revealed the fact that they got computers.  That was a victory lap.  Nobody should have ever known that they got computers.  They revealed the fact that they got telephone numbers of two guys in Osama bin Laden\\'s phone book.  Nobody should have revealed that.  Why did the Obama administration reveal that?  They were proud of it.  But they didnt reveal the pictures.  Why didnt they reveal the pictures?--', \"I think that illustrates my point, which is, in fact, the proposition is correct.  Freedom of the press does give way before state secrets.  And the reason that we can accept that proposition is because we have built a structure that actually is quite protective even within the terms of that proposition.  The reason that there haven't been prosecutions of journalists is because people weigh what will happen in a courtroom with a judge and a jury.  And so when you do your job in a close case, if you feel you're acting in good faith, you can have a reasonably high degree of confidence that if it doesn't wind up in a prosecution, you can go to court, and you're going to wind up prevailing in front of a judge and a jury.\", 'And actually I think Alan --', 'But isnt --', \"But doesn't that actually illustrate the point we've been making, that the restrictions in place do allow a judgment to be made about whether something will cross the line or not because --\", \"Well, sure, you did because you were able to predict that you have -- you know what the track record of the law is, you know that if a decision is made to prosecute, you're going to have a jury and a judge and you'll be able to make an appeal to them, and all of those allow you some freedom of movement, but not absolute freedom of movement.  The flipside of it is to go back to the bin Laden case and maybe The Times wouldn't have published it, but there might be other news organs that would, if a news organ had gotten a hold of the plan to put SEALs into Abbottabad and they had been able to consider publishing that without any fear of being prosecuted or being enjoined, with absolute impunity, would that be where we want to see the United States?  I suggest if you go back to the very quote that Gabriel made earlier about the Constitution not being a suicide pact, giving that absolute protection would be devastating for the United States.\", 'No, it would be --', '-- an example --', 'I think it would be an example of taking away from the three branches of government the authority to make decisions about securing the United States, which was, in many ways, the reason the Constitution was formed -- was to make this effective and to hand it over to the press.  And not probably just The New York Times.  It could be any organ of the press.  And the last point I have to make on this is that the press is so concerned about the possibility of chilling because an injunction or prosecution for leaking national security secrets.  If you take copyrighted material from another news organ, and you publish it without permission, you can be sued, you can be prosecuted.', 'Right.  Exactly.', 'Does that -- and that happens from time to time -- does that cause The Times to enter into a state of paralytic hysteria?', 'They live with that threat of being [inaudible] -- [talking simultaneously]', \"Well, you're surely not going to argue, David, that the purpose of giving the press immunity is to allow them to play a kind of red teaming on government operations.\", 'Because for example, with Swift, Swift was working perfectly well until we [inaudible] --', \"Swift was the program that allowed the U.S. government to track the flow of money to terrorists on a global basis, which was exactly what the 9/11 Commission recommended. And it was a very useful and important program.  And it wasn't failing.  And the revelation of the program ultimately led to it becoming much less effective.\", \"And no issues of illegalities, The Times itself conceded.  So there was a minimal public interest.  This wasn't exposing criminality.  What about the plans for weaponizing anthrax or for coming up with biological weapons?  Would you take the argument that if we publicize those plans, that shows that the information is out there, therefore let's disseminate it widely so people can begin to cook up bacterial anthrax in their garage?  I think the logic in this refutes itself.\", \"Well, I think the answer to the question then was, essentially as the question you're asked, you can see that there obviously are occasions when the press should be prosecuted for publication.\", 'Of state secrets.  And the issue then becomes --', \"And the argument that David makes is, but the problem is it's too hard because there's too much classified material.  And yet the facts show that when it comes time to make the decision to prosecute, government historically, whether it be Republicans or Democrats, have been very, very conservative and cautious in actually prosecuting.  And that tells me the system works, that in fact the government doesn't overreach on prosecution and that it is possible to have a workable system where people who are responsible journalists know where they can't go, like the bin Laden case, and the irresponsible ones, dare I say Assange, may find themselves in a different --\", 'Again, I mean, I hate to say it.  I think that gives the whole game away.  So if we agreed that the Identities Protection Act, if we agree the Communications and Cryptographic Act which are very specific --', \"-- that those appropriate, that prosecutions are appropriate. Then I think you've conceded that in fact state secrets ought to be sufficient to make the - - [talking simultaneously]\", 'No.  I think what the for side is saying is that the statement is correct in the context of the government system in which we operate.  That\\'s why saying, well, you know, this is -- we don\\'t want to become like Egypt or Russia, that\\'s not the context in which the proposition is offered. The proposition is offered in the context of our current system of government in which part of the protection for the press is not just, quote, \"Freedom of the press in the First Amendment.\"  But it is the structure of government that says if you actually want to take the step of prosecution, you\\'ve got to have an executive decision to prosecute. You\\'ve got to judge who will consider Alan Dershowitz\\'s arguments about whether the law is properly written, and you\\'ll have a jury of 12 people like you who will make the final decision. And in that context the proposition, I think, makes the unassailable point that freedom of the press has to be balanced against and in some instances give way to state secrets.', \"And I think that illustrates exactly why I think the current system works not perfectly but as well as you can have in human existence.  The current system as you point out in the question recognizes that there's never an absolute.  There are probably some times that you could reveal the identity of an agent when it's out there already, and you could argue that there's really no impact.  There are other times when you're reviewing other kinds of information that would be terribly devastating or damaging, again, recipes for certain kinds of weapons or for the revelation of certain kinds of operational plans.  And the key is in all of these situations what we do is we have a system for resolving a prosecution because we involve people like sitting in this room and 12 jurors in the box, and that is the protection that we have that in the end the law will be applied reasonably and a reasonable application of the law is the best defense. A rigid application is one which is likely to wind up with exactly the kind of conundrum [inaudible]--\", \"But isn't that a great example --\", \"Isn't that a great --\", \"Alan, isn't that a great example -- I didn't want to bring up the WikiLeaks, but since you have I will.\", \"Isn't that a great example of the fact that attributing ill motive to juries or to prosecutors or to the government omits the fact that there can be ill motive on the publisher?  In the case of Assange, it's reported that his purpose in leaking the information as he told his associates is because he wants to make it impossible for the U.S. government to function by making it impossible for secrets to be held, so that people cant have conversations. So he's motivated by ill will to the United States.  Now, is this the man we want to trust if God forbid he got a hold of the bin Laden attack plan, do we want to trust him to exercise his judgment?\", 'Or would we rather trust people like those in this room?', 'Well, I think --', 'Oh, sorry.', 'You know --', \"-- I would say the question you're -- I'd like to actually suggest you come up and -- he's done a very good job of succinctly stating, I think the case for the proposition.  In the end, there is going to be mistake and error and potentially ill will on both sides.  What Dave is arguing is that because the initial process of classifying is less than perfect and can be overbroad, that means that we have to throw the whole system out and the press has to have, essentially, free run. My argument is that instead of looking at only one part of the process, let's look at the whole process.  If we come to the point of a prosecution, it's not just going to be the person who classified who is going to be part of that decision.  It's not just going to be the prosecutor.  In the end, it's going to have to be presented to a judge and a jury.  There will be multiple of layers who have the opportunity to bring their judgment to bear on whether the decision to publish was right or violated the law.  And that to me is the greatest protection of all.  And -- because I have faith in the public and the courts and the entire process, I would rather trust that than Julian Assange to make that decision. [applause]\", 'But actually, that illustrates my point because factually, David, what actually happened was I testified about the fact that these were --', \"Not eventually, up front.  And that's the point, to answer the question. The government often itself will reveal, in a general sense, what the limitations are.  In the case of these devices, it was that shielded material could not be detected.  You had to add an additional device.  Where I think there is a greater danger is if you get to a certain level of specificity.  For example, if you want to talk about general vulnerability in the New York subway system, you can argue that that's not harmful.  It's even helpful.  If you want to say there's a particular location where a bomb would cause a crippling devastating blow to the operation of the system, that, I think, would make us unsafe, and that should be a state secret.  And that's really what we're arguing for with this proposition.\", 'I actually do.', 'No, actually, I --', 'Well, I -- as the proponents --', '-- I think we say -- it does not say all state secrets.  It says some state secrets.  Or state secrets.  You\\'re right. [laughter] Male Speaker: I\\'m looking for the word \"some\" there. Michael Chertoff: I\\'m sorry.  I misspoke.  But let me explain what I mean.  We don\\'t, as I said up front, we don\\'t argue that everything that the government does is a state secret.  We argue that some things are state secrets and that the reason the freedom of press has to give way is because there is a process for adjudicating what is state secrets that works, a process that requires, before there is punishment, that you go through a decision to prosecute, a judge winds up weighing in on it, and a jury winds up resolving it. And that under that circumstance, existing set of laws that do inhibit freedom of the press for state secrets work and ought to be kept.  I believe my adversaries are arguing the existing set of laws are too discretionary, and we ought to have a recipe list, and only things in the recipe list ought to be prosecuted.', \"I do think the questioner absolutely put the question that really is dividing us, which is who decides?  And I would argue and I think our proposition will be at the end of today that it is the combination of Congress having passed the law, the executive branch making its decision to prosecute, and the judge and the jury, you people, deciding whether to convict or not.  That's where the ultimate decision has to be made, not in WikiLeaks or in Julian Assange's living room.\", \"Well, we support the proposition because the proof of the pudding is that we've had hundreds of years of American history where these statues have not been, in fact, a tool to oppress or to run rampant through the First Amendment.  I think that our adversaries have essentially conceded that there are a category of state secrets that ought to be protected. And what they are arguing is the existing structure is somehow not definite enough.  But I just want to spend one minute talking about what the existing law is.  Because in fact, I think it strikes the right balance, which is the context in which we advocate this proposition.  We have the Communications Intelligence Act protecting the information about our top secret code breaking and code making communications activity, quite specific, very reasonable and very understandable. That's what keeps us safe.  We have the Intelligence Identities Act, keeping the names of intelligence agents safe as David acknowledges is appropriate and again part of the law. Even the Espionage Act, which has gotten the brunt of the fire power here, requires a finding by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that there was intent to damage the national security of the United States, not good intentions, not accident, not negligence, but bad intent to injure the security of the United States.  I would argue that's exactly the kind of specificity that is appropriate in defining the category of state secrets that we are arguing ought to be protected under this proposition.  And in fact the message that will be sent will not be one that will chill responsible reporters.  It will be one that will chill the Julian Assanges who want to publish things because they want to hurt the United States and then want to claim the First Amendment to protect them against the consequences of that kind of decision. Thank you very much.\"]\n",
      "[\"That's right.\", 'Yes.  And I can see far ahead as well.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.  The gravity of the issue we\\'re debating here tonight cannot be overstated.  At stake is nothing less than preventing a reprise of the kinds of attacks that befell our city and our country nearly 10 years ago.  To keep our country secure, our government inevitably generates a great many secrets of many different kinds. We cannot disclose all of the methods by which we track terrorists.  We cannot publicize the vulnerabilities of our bridges and tunnels and buildings.  We have an absolute duty to conceal things like the blueprints for nuclear weapons or the formulas for substances like aerosolized anthrax.  But equally at stake is the character of our democracy.  We live in an open society, and secrecy is antithetical to the democratic idea.  Secrecy can be used as a cover for corruption and wrong-doing.  And we depend upon a free press to keep us informed about what our government is doing in our name, including the things that it\\'s doing in secret, or at least some of them.  And indeed the foreign affairs pages of our major newspapers are filled with stories based upon reporting drawn from state secrets. And that\\'s the way things are, and that\\'s the way they ought to be. But even as we have a press that we want to be delving into state secrets, it must do so under the rule of law.  That is the press must be vulnerable to prosecution when it violates the laws governing secrecy.  Now here, as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, we run head long into the First Amendment.  The First Amendment says that Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or the press.  But, of course, we live with numerous abridgments of free speech and free press, all widely accepted by the public and upheld by the courts.  We can\\'t libel one another.  We can\\'t engage in false advertising.  And of course, it\\'s forbidden to yell, \"Fire\" -- falsely yell, \"Fire\" in a crowded theater like this one.  Now, Congress has enacted several statutes that criminalize the publication of state secrets.  The Espionage Act was mentioned but one might also point to the Atomic Energy Act that makes it a crime to publish classified material pertaining to the design of nuclear weapons. Or the COMINT Act which makes it a crime to publish classified information pertaining to cryptography, or code breaking, or the Intelligence Identities Protection Act makes it a crime to publish the identities of undercover CIA officers and other intelligence officers of the U.S. government.  Now, these laws are all in obvious tension with the First Amendment, but no court has ever struck them down.  And it is a statement of fact, ladies and gentlemen, the proposition under debate here tonight, the freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets, is inarguably true.  Valid laws are on the books that criminalize the publication of certain state secrets.  Now, does the existence of such laws mean that every time a journalist like my colleague here, David Sanger, publishes a state secret he should be prosecuted and marched off to prison?  Absolutely not.  That would be foolish in the extreme.  That\\'s why we recognize that our government is promiscuous with the secrecy stamp. It marks lots of things secret that need not be.  And back when I was an editor at Commentary Magazine, I myself published classified information and I would do so again.  The real question raised by the proposition is whether the press can and should be prosecuted in those instances when it places the country in danger.  Such danger is not purely hypothetical. Back in the 1970s there was a magazine called Counterspy that began to publish the identities of hundreds of CIA officers around the world.  In 1975, it outed Richard Welch as the CIA Station Chief in Athens.  And no sooner was his name disclosed that he was murdered by a Greek terrorist organization as a direct result of that revelation. Today we have WikiLeaks which in the name of transparency has indiscriminately dumped thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables onto the Internet.  Now, some of those documents are innocuous.  And many of them without question help us better understand what our government is doing around the world and what other governments are doing, but some of them are outright dangerous.  One WikiLeaks document, a U.S. Army document that they put on the Internet, describes the technical details of the jamming devices used by our soldiers in Iraq to scramble the signals that insurgents were using to detonate roadside bombs.  Now, I ask you is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish the secret countermeasures used by our soldiers to keep from getting blown up on the battlefield? Is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish blueprints for making nuclear bombs -- or should it be legal to give out the recipe for -- to publish the recipe for making aerosolized anthrax?  Those are questions that I hope we will receive straightforward answers to tonight from David Sanger and Alan Dershowitz.  If they believe those things should be allowed, I hope they\\'ll fully and frankly acknowledge the costs, and if they think those things should be prohibited by law, well, then they\\'ll be agreeing with the very proposition that they supposedly came here to oppose.  Ladies and gentlemen, freedom of the press does not, cannot, and should not extend to state secrets. Not all government secrets warrant protection, but some clearly do.  And if you in the audience agree with what Justice Robert Jackson once memorably said, that the Constitution of the United States is not a suicide pact, I urge you to vote for the proposition at issue here tonight. Thank you. [applause]', 'Well, I find that curious.  Operational secrets -- what is the Swift program?  But an operational program to monitor the finances of al-Qaeda that the Times published against the strong protest not only of the Bush administration but leading Democrats like Lee Hamilton of the 9/11 Commission.  And the Times justification for it was always quite murky.  Eric Lichtblau, the reporter, one of the two reporters who wrote the story, said in his memoir about it, \"It was, above all else, an interesting yarn.\"  What was the public interest that was served there? The Times -- the ombudsman of the Times, as Secretary Chertoff pointed out, disavowed the story.  So did the general counsel of the Times.  So I don\\'t think that in the final analysis we can just have a system where editors make the -- make such decisions without being subject, vulnerable to prosecution, not necessarily prosecuted, for instance, but vulnerable to prosecution.', \"It may be dangerous for leakers but it certainly -- the historical record is not one of danger for the press.  There's never been a successful prosecution of journalists as David Sanger just noted.  And the one case, I'm wondering what you think about it, that where there was -- a prosecution was initiated, The Chicago Tribune case in World War II where the government -- where The Chicago Tribune published a front page story strongly suggesting that we had broken the Japanese naval codes, a leak that could have cost the lives of tens of thousands of U.S. servicemen.  Now, there are plenty of people, journalists who think that there shouldn't -- that there shouldn't have been a prosecution, but, I mean, that seems to me almost madness.\", \"Youre changing the subject, we're talking here about a disclosure that could have cost the lives if tens of thousands of people, should the government go after a newspaper in a case like that or in a case like the Swift case where real-time operational intelligence is jeopardized about people who are trying to blow up our subways.\", 'By that logic -- [talking simultaneously]', 'And by that logic, Professor Dershowitz, The Times should have published, if it had known in advance, that we were about to make the raid on bin Laden. Male Speaker: If -- Gabriel Schoenfeld: Because it could have gotten wrong.  And then we would have to abort the operation?', \"Let's talk about how this would actually have played out. [talking simultaneously] Gabriel Schoenfeld: Hundreds of people are involved in a military operation like that. Male Speaker: Yeah. Gabriel Schoenfeld: Thousands of people are involved -- Male Speaker: Right. Gabriel Schoenfeld: -- in other secrets.  2.5 million Americans hold security clearances.  Eight hundred thousand of them --\", \"-- hold top secret clearances.  With populations of that size, you're going to have people who disagree with the government, people who might be deranged, people who are going to leak secrets.  We cannot --\", 'The legislature -- the legislature has not punted.  We do have highly specific laws on the books. The direct question was put to you, Mr. Sanger, would you prosecute -- should the press be prosecuted when it violates those sanctions, when it violates those particular statutes? If the press publishes, for example, the identities of an intelligence agent, CIA agent, do you believe that the press should be prosecuted?  If the press publishes designs of nuclear weapons, as the Progressives tried to do in 1979, is there a basis for prosecution?', 'I have the microphone.  I have the microphone. Even if we take your suggestion, and scrap the Espionage Act, which I would have trouble trusting the current Congress to do a better job than the one that wrote it in 1917-- [applause]', \"But even if we did that, and we had a new set of laws that somehow managed to enumerate the very complex set of things that have to be protected.  It's not just a little list of six, by the way. You still -- if you had new laws, you'd still have juries, and you'd still have prosecutors using their discretion.  That's built into our system.  It's not a perfect system.  Name a better one.\", \"It's a very high hurdle.  It's a very high hurdle prosecuting a journalist under the Espionage Act. And they have to show bad faith on the part of the journalist, intent to injure the United States. Male Speaker: No, no, no, no. Gabriel Schoenfeld: That's -- wait.  Let me, let me finish.  But I want to just return back to this question of the raid on Osama bin Laden.  Which you say the Times would not have printed if it had known in advance, would not have wanted to jeopardize that example that the American forces.  But just a few minutes before that, you were saying you were applauding the fact that the Times should have published in advance the Bay of Pigs operation.  Which is it?\", 'And we should add that --', \"-- the other side has not really addressed this whole very striking example of the Swift program, where the Times revealed an ongoing operational intelligence-gathering program directed at al-Qaeda's finances. And it's true that the treasury secretary had mentioned that, in general terms, we were tracking their finances.  But it certainly, until that story appeared in --\", \"I wouldn't have come here to participate in a debate arguing for the proposition --\", \"-- that we should prosecute any, all state secrets.  That would be an absurdity.  I agree with our opponents here that the government wildly over-classifies and misclassifies, and that's a chronic problem.  It's a problem that's not going to be reformed any time soon. But it means that there are categories of genuine secrets.  That what we're talking about here.  And what's ultimately at stake is that we live in a regime in which, in the final analysis, it's the democratic system, our Congress, the executive branch and the courts that get to decide which secrets are protected.\", \"The question is -- the question has been decided by our Congress, which has created a set of statutes, the Espionage Act and the other statutes I have mentioned, the Atomic Energy Act. And then the executive branch gets to carry out, enforce those statutes.  And we live in a very liberal regime. In our whole history we've never had a successful prosecution of a journalist, and only one attempted prosecution.  So I don't think there's much of a chilling effect, but the basic principle is in place.  Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets because the government has the final word; the jury has the final word.\", \"If we want to have a debate about the Espionage Act, I would think we'd probably be in agreement. It's a very vague act.  It's [unintelligible] --\", \"-- its reform.  But I don't feel -- but I think it's very difficult to reform --\", '-- but I favor the basic principle.', \"I agree with David Sanger on this last point, that we should have a system that has a bias in favor of publication -- including a legal bias -- and I think that's the system we have and the very vagueness of the Espionage Act actually has helped the press and created -- helped us create a free press, the freest press in the world.  And I think there's room for reform, but our government leaks like a sieve, and the press publishes secrets all the time. But I'm just reminded of an episode that occurred in late 2009, when a New York Times reporter -- one of your colleagues, David Rohde, was kidnapped by the Taliban.  And Bill Keller, the executive editor of the paper, made the executive decision to withhold that information from the public.  And not only did The Times not cover it, but he got all of his industry competitors and all of the Internet to agree not to reveal that David Rohde had been kidnapped.  And the idea was he didn't want to do anything that would endanger Rohde's life. And of course, that was a speculative decision, because really, publishing information about Rohde -- the fact that he had been captured -- the Taliban knew he'd been captured. But they withheld the story.  And I say to Bill Keller, All honor to Bill Keller for that! They protected the life of their guy.  But when the decision involves non-journalists, it can't be.  When it involves us.  The people who ride the subway in New York.  It can't be a voluntary decision up to Bill Keller.  We -- and that's why we have laws on the books that in the final analysis, do allow for the prosecution of the journalists when they publish not just the random things that are stamped secret for no good reason, but the genuine, really hardcore secrets that place our lives in danger, including some of the things that your newspaper has published -- like the SWIFT story, once again.

      "['Nebraska.', 'Pennsylvania.', \"Well, I'm making plenty of noise there too.\", \"when I served as counsel to John Ashcroft at the Justice Department.  And after I left the Justice Department in 2003, I left with a very important idea in my head and that was that the rule of law has broken down in immigration, and much had to be done to restore it. But it had to be done not only at the national level, but also at the state level.  And that's why I got involved helping states like Arizona and many other states. In 2007 for the first time, every state in the country saw legislation introduced into the state legislature to, in some way, restrict or slow down the pace of immigration into that state.  Not all of them passed, but that's an important point.  Every state is a border state now.  The reason that nearly all of the states on the map are trying to take steps to discourage illegal immigration is several-fold.  But the number one driver is a very important point in this debate, and I'd like to start there.  The fiscal cost, fiscal cost, the cost to governments, to taxpayers to the illegal immigration in particular is unsustainable. My point can be summarized in one sentence by Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman.  He said, it's just obvious. You can't have open immigration and a welfare state.  You can't have open immigration and a welfare state.  Now, my guess is that there are a few fans of the welfare state here in the audience.  I am not a big fan myself, I accept the reality that it's here to stay.  And given that reality, there is an important distinction that needs to be made between the current wave of immigration, which started in the '80s and has been going unabated for three decades, and all preceding waves of immigration. They were not immigrating into a welfare state.  They were immigrating into a situation where they rose or they fell based on their own merits.  There was no safety net to catch them.  That is a critical distinction that changes everything.  When Emma Lazarus wrote that poem, she spoke of a lady holding the golden -- the lamp by the golden door.  Now, the golden door she was referring to was a golden door of opportunity.  You come here, you're free to do whatever you can.  You make it or you lose it, but it's all up to you. Now that golden door represents goodies, public benefits, services that are available to people who come to the United States more than any other nation in the Western hemisphere.  The golden door represents something completely different.  Now, aliens are consuming those benefits far more than U.S. citizens are doing so. Now, the average per household consumption -- that consumption of public services and benefits, is estimated, from a 2007 figure, not 1993 numbers, 2007, to be $19,400 per year net. They're consuming -- and this is all immigrants, the illegal and legal combined.  19,400 per year more in services than they're paying it in taxes.  So that's a net drag on the fiscal status of the country.  Now, Julin mentioned this 1993 study.  I have not seen that study. That is so old I wouldn't even know where to begin because the numbers are so different back then.  Now we're talking 11.3 million illegal aliens in the country.  There was also a study that came out last month based on census figures from 2010, and the number was generated by the Center for Immigration Studies, crunching the numbers, 71 percent of illegal alien households are consuming some form of welfare, 52 percent of lawfully present alien-headed households are consuming some form of welfare, in contrast to only 39 percent of the U.S. citizen-headed households are consuming some form of welfare. Now, the explanation for this is obvious.  It has nothing to do with ethnicity or nationality, it has everything to do with economics and demographics.  Poor people are more likely to consume welfare. And immigrants coming into the United States, especially illegal immigrants, are almost in all cases having less than a high school education.  If you look at all immigrants combined, about two-thirds have a high school education or less, and so we are importing a very impoverished set of immigrants, both legal and illegal, into the country.  Here's another fact to chew on.  The Mexico-American border has the greatest disparity in income levels of any border on the planet.  There is no other national border where the difference between the rich country and the poor country per capita is greater.  That fuels a lot of this fiscal cost, too.  So since 1996, Congress has passed laws trying to discourage this handing out of public benefits because it exacerbates the problem.  Most states have ignored that law.  New York is one of the states that continues to give public benefits to illegal aliens.  New York also gives in-state tuition rates to certain illegal aliens.  Think about that if you are a -- [applause] -- well, I don't think any of the out-of-state students who are at a public institution are clapping right now because they're paying out-of-state tuition rates. Now, the -- nationwide, as Tom mentioned, it's over $100 billion a year net that is flowing out to illegal aliens, that is to say, they're consuming that much more in benefits than they're paying in taxes.  And the burden falls overwhelmingly at the states.  Indeed, I like to say illegal immigration is the ultimate unfunded federal mandate because the federal government, which is chiefly responsible for enforcing the laws, fails to do so, and then the states have to pay the burden.  You can think of story after story about this. Hazelton, Pennsylvania, one of the cities that I'm representing, they saw their population explode from 20,000 in the year 2000 to about 30,000 five years later, 50 percent increase in population, but they get most of their revenue from an earned income tax and their revenue remained flat.  Population goes up 50 percent, no additional tax revenue, that was because most of the additional people coming in were working at a meat packing plant nearby, were illegal aliens, and they were either earning too little income to pay any taxes or they were earning purely cash income. And the city wasn't getting any revenues.  Look what happened.  All the costs to the city went up 50 percent, all the costs contingent on population.  The school districts, the budget was breaking, English as a Second Language, the expenditures in 2002 were 136,000 that year.  In 2006, they went up to 1.1 million.  Talk about that kind of burden on a small town school district.  The same thing is happening at the national level.  And as a result, we have to recognize that there is a fiscal cost.  Or take it on the individual level.  Look at the jobs.  There are 14 million Americans out of work.  A vast majority of the 11.3 illegal -- million illegal aliens have those jobs, about seven million are in the workforce.  Many states are realizing the simple truth, if you want to create a real job for a U.S. citizen tomorrow, deport an illegal alien today.  It actually works. [applause] But of course many of you are probably thinking, and I'm sure we'll hear from the other side, that those are jobs Americans won't do, that those are jobs that are too low on the totem pole for Americans to do. Well, the statistics don't bear that out because in every single one of the industry -- industrial sectors where illegal aliens are prominent, U.S. citizens still have the majority of jobs there, 74 percent of construction workers, U.S. citizens, 76 percent of food preparation workers, U.S. citizens, 56 percent of agriculture laborers, U.S. citizens.  The U.S. citizens are there, and they're working right alongside the illegal aliens who are depressing the wages or taking their jobs outright.  So if we care about our fiscal health, and if we care about the Americans who are struggling to put food on the table, we should look very seriously at our immigration problem in the United States. [applause]\", \"It is true that aliens, legal and illegal, of course, pay sales taxes. They indirectly pay property taxes.  They may pay some income taxes if they're working under a false Social Security number.  I'm talking about the illegal aliens here.\", \"But the fiscal impact is undisputed.  Now, there are some economic studies that look at the overall impact.  Have we cheapened the price of some goods?  Have we given some economic benefits?  But if you narrow it to the fiscal impact, it is undisputed.  Every single study in the last 10 years, whether you're talking about Robert Rector's study in 2007 or the Census Bureau numbers that I related just a moment ago where you have seven, eight percent of illegal aliens consuming welfare programs, 51 percent of legal aliens and 39 percent of U.S. citizens, which, by the way, matches up well with that 40 percent figure.  It shows statistically that they are consuming the fiscal benefits.  And if you just look at in terms of the benefit to us as taxpayers, we're losing on --\", 'I [unintelligible] with that study, that Texas Comptroller study looked -- it didn\\'t just look at fiscal income and outgo, then they went on and considered, \"Well, have there been generations in second and third degree effects of extra businesses or extra --', '-- consumption that might have occurred?\"  Now, that\\'s fine, and look, let\\'s get this straight, the fiscal debate is clear, they are a fiscal drag.  Now, I will agree that there are - - we get cheaper vegetables because of this, but you have to realize there are winners and there are losers.  The winners are the employers who are able to exploit the illegal labor, the losers are the consumer -- the winners are the consumers of some goods who really want that extra two pennies off the price of a head of lettuce, but the losers are the U.S. citizens who lose their jobs, the U.S. citizens who are still working in those fields and are getting paid a lower wage, and the taxpayers.  There\\'s no doubt the taxpayers are the losers.', 'George Borjas --', '2007.', 'So you can see there is a wage effect.', 'I agree.', 'Can I see if we agree on this point?', \"So do we agree on -- do we agree on the Borjas numbers?  Says that if you have a 10 percent increase in the number of laborers in a given industrial sector you will have in the short term a decrease in wages of seven to eight percent, and in the long term a decrease in wages of three to four percent, in the long term.  So we agree on that, they can decide whether that's significant or not.\", 'I think thats significant.', 'There are -- obviously, assimilation has occurred and obviously assimilation can occur in the future in America.  But assimilation doesnt happen automatically.  As Tom mentioned, you have to have -- theres a tipping point.  If the percentage of the immigrant population is so high and is so disproportionately speaking one language or sharing one culture, then the pressure from the rest of us, the rest of the American society, on that group to assimilate is lower.', 'Well, actually, its to encourage people to leave and comply with the law and go home. Thats the idea. [laughter] Now, but let me -- let me give one more point on assimilation, and that is one of the greatest engines of assimilation -- I think we can all agree on this -- is the public schools. In the past for the last 100 years or so, the public schools have been the primary engine of assimilation.  That engine is not working anymore.  According to a study done at a high school in San Diego, I think in 2002 or 2003, after three years of high school, the proportion of students self-identifying themselves as Americans went down 50 percent. The proportion saying they were hyphenated Americans, in other words, Mexican- American or something like that, went down 30 percent.

The United States Supreme Court last opined on this in 1976 about a California immigration law and said, yes, the states can do things to discourage illegal immigration.  There is a case before the United States Supreme Court right now, Whiting versus Chamber of Commerce, we should have a decision within the next month or so, this will be the first time the Supreme Court has spoken in 35 years.  So the precedents are very clearly there, and that's why many of these cases, the states and cities are winning.\", \"It's really interesting, the census has whats called a current population survey and they do these every month and they do a really big one in March. And they actually give them to everybody and illegal aliens answer these surveys.  And so theyre based on very large surveys done by the Census Bureau.  And those numbers, the 11.3 million, those are generally agreed upon numbers by both the Pew Center and by the Center for Immigration Studies so I think theres broad agreement --\", 'The majority of employees in those fields are Americans right now.', 'According to the census, the majority -- 56 percent are Americans in those fields right now.', \"Well, see, you heard the numbers, although they're somewhat disputed about the fiscal drag.  I think everybody's coming to an agreement, Democratic or Republican alike that we have to get a hold of this deficit, $1.4 trillion a year.

Kris Kobach: Well, if we don't create -- if we do not create, in this country, 200,000 jobs a month, that's 200,000 new jobs every month have to be created in this country by the private sector in order for us to climb out of this recession, okay?  Most economists agree that that's the number.  We haven't had a 200,000 monthly increase in quite some time. But we do bring in 160 some thousand a month legally, let alone the numbers that come across the border and fly in this country and stay, which is a significant number.  It's not just people coming across the border who are illegal aliens in the country.  And so they're part of the problem.  Where do those jobs go?\", \"Amnesty is a horrible idea for four quick -- for four reasons.  Number one, you're going to see that the fiscal impact is going to triple.  The 89.3 -- $89.1 billion a year that we're losing fiscally is going to become 2.6 trillion over 10 years.  That was according to the Robert Rector study in 2007.  The reason is simple.  Right now, illegal aliens get food stamps, Medicaid, free school lunches, K through 12 education.  If they become legalized, then they get the big ones.  Then they get Medicare and Social Security.  And the price goes way, way up.  Talk about the golden door.  Number two, it won't just be 11.3 million.  The last time we had a major amnesty in 1986, according to the INS's own records, 398,000 illegal aliens quickly came across the border to falsely claim that they were already here and grabbed the amnesty. Number three, we've been hearing about the terrorists.  We mentioned that earlier about the terrorists coming in.  The notion that we are going to suddenly sift through this population and know who the terrorists are and who they aren't is demonstrably false. Mahmud Abouhalima who was one of the ring leaders in the 93 attack on the World Trade Center here in this city was given amnesty in the 1986 amnesty.  And number four, it's a slap in the face to the people -- Male Speaker: Everybody who paid the price -- Kris Kobach: -- who did it the right way. Male Speaker: And did it the right way.\", \"A slap on the wrist, and then you get to stay.  That's called amnesty.\", 'As a lawyer who has worked in this area, you\\'re right.  It\\'s about 30,000 who are detained.  Those are people in deportation proceedings.  We call them removal proceedings.  But that\\'s a small percentage of the total number of people who are being removed from the country at any given time.  And the reason that 30,000 is actually too low is that if you do not detain an alien while he is in removal proceedings, and then the judge says, at the end of the immigration removal hearing, \"You are deported,\" hands him a removal letter, 93 percent will abscond.  They will leave.  They will disobey the letter.  And it\\'s known among the immigration attorneys as a run letter.  And so if you don\\'t detain, they don\\'t go.  And if we believe that our courts have any meaning, and are nothing more than just a laughing stock, we have got to try to detain the ones that present the highest risk of leaving --', 'Okay.

There is no industry that expresses this more than the meatpacking industry.  The meatpacking industry 30 years ago was almost entirely worked by U.S. citizens, the Green Bay Packers, a bunch of, you know, whole cities built on meatpacking.  But today, the meatpacking industry is about half and half, about half illegal aliens, half U.S. citizens. We see exactly what happens when the INS, now ICE goes and shuts down a meatpacking company because -- or does a raid, and suddenly 300 employees have gone out.  There was a raid in Georgia a few years ago, and they had two to 300 employees were arrested. What happened?  Wages went up.  They had to go up.  They went from $6.75 an hour, and then they went up to $7.75 an hour, and what happened was U.S. citizens and legal aliens started taking the jobs once the wages got high enough.\", 'Thats exactly what has to happen.', 'Twenty years ago, the average wage in meatpacking was about $12 an hour.', 'Now its about eight dollars an hour, thats not in real dollars thats in absolute dollars. Theres no other industry --', \"I just want to address a couple of loose ends quickly.  Julin just mentioned this notion that if we had an amnesty, it would be just fine.  It'd be fair because the illegal aliens would go to the end of the line.  Legally speaking, that's impossible.  When you have an amnesty, you immediately give lawful status to the people who are here.  They have been automatically given what four to five million people are waiting for who are trying to do it the right way.  There is no such thing as the end of the line.  As soon as you grant an amnesty, the person is automatically at the front of the line.  And then we heard from them earlier that we shouldn't have a policy that fluctuates, encourages immigration some years, it discourages it depending on the needs of the U.S. economy.  It should be pretty much wide open all the time.  No.  That's exactly what we want.  We want immigration policy that is legal and that meets the interests of the United States because we owe our highest duty to our own citizens.  And finally, we hear about this point again and again, and they're encouraging this myth of belief that there are jobs Americans won't do.  And we have to bring them in for the lower end jobs because Americans won't do those jobs. Now, remember, I told you the statistics.  Americans are doing those jobs.  But there's a cultural problem with that argument too.  It's encouraging high school kids today, many of whom have never pulled on the starter cord of a Briggs and Stratton lawnmower engine, to believe that certain jobs are beneath them.  I would say that is un-American. Our country is built on manual labor, everybody going through a period in their life when they worked a job like that, and then they moved on.  Well, this attitude of, let the immigrants do those jobs is a pernicious attitude in our society.  And so I'll conclude -- [applause] -- conclude with this.  Don't give us your tired and your poor because our tired and our poor American citizens, who are disproportionately minority and who are out of work need those jobs.  They need also the welfare state to survive.  And those things are not going to happen if you have a massive amnesty or you have unbridled illegal immigration continuing, which an amnesty would further. So let's look after our own tired and our own poor and then look at immigration in terms of what services our national interests.\"]\n",
      "[\"That's right.\", 'Well, I will be happy to answer that.  Let me first tell you that I must say in response to your discussion about the title of this debate, about the proposition itself, I was a little bit uptight about it originally because, after all, we are debating this issue here in New York City a few miles from Ellis Island.  And I have been -- I have participated in things in the past that have been a little bit skewed, and I can recall a spoof of me, a debate -- or actually it was supposed to be a little discussion between me and Vincente Fox, but it was a spoof on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and so they had someone who looked like -- and I knew it was biased from the beginning, from the very beginning because the guy playing me looked like me and the guy playing Vincente Fox was Antonio Banderas -- [laughter] No fair, come on, guys.', 'Frankly, I -- you look at it and begin to think about the ramifications of immigration, both legal and illegal, and they are fascinating.  It is really one of the most intellectually stimulating areas of public policy I think we can possibly talk about.', 'A great deal of mythology has built up around the Statue of Liberty, around the Emma Lazarus poem, and a lot of that mythology, of course, is just that.  It\\'s mythology.  But unfortunately we have a tendency in the United States, we look back sort of nostalgically at a period of time because most of us are either children of or grandchildren of immigrants, and so the whole idea of immigration has a sort of a nostalgic appeal to us, and that\\'s our first thought usually.  And I am the same way.  I am the grandson of Italian immigrants, came right here into Ellis Island. And my parents being first generation Americans were very, very strict about one thing and that was to become an American, to become -- and it meant a lot of things to them in different ways, and I\\'ll get to it in a minute, except that I do want you to understand I have that same nostalgic opinion to a large extent of what our immigration policy was, but we can\\'t confuse that and make -- and develop true policy today based on mythology and, you know, some of the myths that we have to dispel.  I think tonight\\'s a good place to do it, its -- first of all the Statue of Liberty was not a gift from France that was designed to explore the wonderful idea of open immigration.  Indeed it had nothing to do with immigration policy.  It had everything to do with extolling the virtues of a republic. In fact, the statue was called Liberty Enlightening the World.  It was not called Liberty Inviting the World.  As for the Emma Lazarus poem, it was added 30 years after the statue got here. And it was about that time that the author of the poem, Ms. Lazarus, was talking about the need to limit immigration to various groups.  Remember also that a lot of the tired, and poor, and huddled masses got stamped return to sender\" here at Ellis Island.  There were people with dangerous elements and ailments like pinkeye or a cough or fever, and if anyone exhibited any degree of exhaustion by climbing the very steep stairway over at Ellis Island which was purposely built that way, that was one of the things that could get you sent home.  It was not a take all comers time in American history.  As for the poor, well, long before the Ellis Island experience, the colonies had enacted very, very stringent regulations about this particular aspect of immigration policy. In New York in 1691, it required an immigrant to have, quote, \"A visible estate or manual occupation or give a sufficient surety that he shall not be a burden or a charge to the respective place that he shall come to inhabit.\"  In 1996 in the Congress of the United States, they tried to actually expand on this and say that you had to have an affidavit signed by someone if youre coming here, you had to have an affidavit of support.  They put it in, it was part of the Welfare Reform Bill, never, not one time, never has it been enforced.  And so the fact is we are in a -- unfortunately, we are importing a large degree of poverty into the United States.  The National Academy of Sciences along with the Center for Immigration studies shows that welfare use, the rates for welfare use, are significantly higher for immigrant households than they are for nonimmigrant households. Federation for Immigration Reform could identify a net cost, net cost after taxes were paid by illegal immigrants, they were just focusing on that one part, a net cost to American taxpayers of over $150 billion annually.  Now, my point here is to show that for a long period of time in American history, we had what I would think was, and believe, is a rational policy.  It was rational for us to bring in a lot of people, especially during the hay-day of American immigration, the 1890s and 1900s, a lot of people who were low-skill, low-wage people.  Why?  Because, of course, we were building the Industrial Revolution here.  They were fueling it.  That was appropriate.  It was right.  It served purpose for the people coming and it served a purpose for the people here.  I hope -- well, also, as I see were getting toward the end of that 7-minute period, there is another myth I want to try to dispel quickly. And that is that immigration has always been sort of a straight-line increase from the time America started until today, that its always just been going up.  Absolutely untrue. About 1830 is when immigration began to be statistically relevant in the United States.  It started to climb.  By 1850, it started to go down.  Around 1880, it grew.  Around 1890, it declined.  It rose dramatically right before the First World War, but declined dramatically after the First World War with the Immigration Act of 1924.  It stayed relatively low for a long period of time until, as a matter of fact, 1965, when everything changed with the Immigration Act that was pushed by Senator Kennedy at the time, Senator Teddy Kennedy.  And weve had now really massive immigration, low-skill, low-wage workers ever since that period of time. Now whether or not those -- that cyclical movement and that cyclical characterization I just gave you of immigration was purposeful or not.  It had and served a good purpose, I think.  We had periods of high immigration.  We had periods of low immigration.  And you know what happened during the periods of low immigration?  People used that time to assimilate.  And let me tell you, from my point of view, this is by far the most important aspect of the debate.  Assimilation -- we can have massive amounts of immigration to this country, the right time and the right type of immigration, especially, as I say, depending upon our needs here as long as we have assimilation along with it. Or, if it doesnt happen along with it, it has to happen at that period of time that we take a break, which is not a bad idea for us to think about even now, because assimilation is not occurring. Its not occurring to the extent -- I mean, I know you cant categorically say that, but it is certainly not occurring to the extent that we need it to in this country.  We desperately need, perhaps more than any country in the world, we need things to hold us together, to think about as being Americans, to connect together, not pull us apart.  And Im afraid our immigration policy is doing just that.', \"Well, certainly, you could establish an immigration policy based upon the needs of the country in an economic sense.  And that is a determination I think that we have made many times during our past.  Are our needs primarily low-skill, low-wage workers, or are they with high skilled.  The people that Tamar and the mayor referred to as being these startup companies, these affluent -- or at least people who became affluent, had all these skills, great, fine. It's wonderful.  But I'm telling you that that's not what our immigration policy is today. Today it is based almost entirely on something called family unification.  And because we've had so many people coming into the country over such a long period of time from such low-skilled, low-wage backgrounds that that's who we get.\", \"Well, sure.  It's, if you get here, once you get here and get status here, status as someone here legally, you can begin the process of bringing in your family, bringing in the immediate family then bringing in extended family.\", \"Being it's coming exactly from the same group of people, the same economic group, especially, that is predominantly low-skilled, low-wage workers when we have, right now, at least -- by the way, this is also legal -- I'm talking legal immigration.\", \"Let alone the people that are coming across the borders illegally.  Not many of those people have these kinds of skills that you're talking about that are so desperately needed.\", \"It's interesting that you mention that because, of course, when we also start talking about the taxes that immigrants and even people who are here illegally pay, there is -- your side suggests that they're paying their fair share.  But in reality, they pay nothing in terms of income taxes. Most of the people we're talking about end up getting income tax credit and therefore money back from the federal government because again, it's low-skilled, low-wage work. And low-skilled, low-wage people don't pay income taxes.  They usually pay -- they pay sales taxes and that sort of thing.  But it never balances off with --\", '-- the costs we incur for the infrastructure we provide.', 'They do.', 'That is true.  And economic impacts are not positive.', \"Which, by the way, they'll never be able to claim.\", \"That rightwing organization, the National Academy of Sciences, I mean, will you accept that as a legitimate entity that assesses these issues?  I mean, it doesn't have -- to the best of my knowledge, it doesn't have a dog in this fight, it doesn't have a political bone to pick with anybody.  It's the National Academy of Sciences.  You can argue with the -- with CIS and other studies, but the National Academy of Sciences shows that you're not correct, Tamar, when you suggest that this isn't a fiscal drain on this country.  It most certainly is.\", \"It is also just common sense, it's not even something that you have to go through reams of statistical evidence to prove it is common sense. If you come here without an ability to provide a service that is well paid for you are not going to be able to pay the income taxes you're talking about, but you are undeniably going to require the services, the services for your children, the children who are in the public school system, the services for the -- the social services --\", '-- the social service benefits.', 'Yeah, or in the [spelled phonetically] day today [spelled phonetically]. [applause]', 'Sure, an investment.  Well, okay, how about the investment in our prison system?', 'It would be exactly the same, quite frankly, if the numbers were close.  What I mean by that is this -- all during the period of time that we talk about as being the heyday of immigration to this country, we of course witnessed exactly what you say in terms of people coming here and being, you know, sort of sequestered or put in -- or sequestering themselves. I mean, it didnt always happen because we forced it that way.  You know, groups settled where they were comfortable, settled in what we call ghettos sometimes.  But thats natural.  Its a natural phenomenon.  Theyre going to look for the people that they know, the language they understand, the customs and habits that theyre familiar with, perfectly natural.  What happened in the past is that the numbers allowed for, and also the timeouts that I mentioned earlier, allowed for an assimilation process.  Even if people didnt want to, they were almost forced into it in order to get ahead in the country.  Of course, there was the issue of English.  My grandparents, I can remember so distinctly my grandmother and grandfather in the back seat of the car, Sunday afternoon drive, after a couple of hours, they had been together for probably long enough in close proximity so they started to argue about things.  And my grandfather would lapse into Italian and my grandmother would yell at him, Speak American, dammit! And it was her purpose, and it --', 'Because the numbers today are so high of people coming from a particular area into a geographic area that bring the culture --', 'That makes is much more difficult to assimilate.', \"Sure, the logical argument is this: If people come into this country illegally, especially illegally, we should all go, huh, well, you're an immigrant, and therefore we should be happy about the fact you're here.  We should not -- we should not raise our concerns about it.  We should not say that people should come into the country the legal way. There is a door.  180 -- 165,000 people a month come in today still legally.  We are the most liberal country in the world regarding to legal immigration.  But the minute we start talking about the fact that people are violating American laws to get here, that's all of a sudden making it an uncomfortable place for immigrants.  Well, bologna.  I will not accept the idea that you can't talk the rule of law and be critical of people coming into this country illegally.\", \"What's wrong with that?\", 'But you want to grant an amnesty.', 'A million -- a little over a million and a quarter people coming legally every year.  And by the way, as you know, Tamar, the number of visas that are allowable for people to come here and work in the agricultural arena, H-2A, I believe, are unlimited.  Right there you could have 10 million people come tomorrow and on their visas.', \"You don't because -- [talking simultaneously]\", 'Just a moment.', \"You don't have that because --\", 'All right.  Okay.', 'Mayor of Detroit has already responded to that, I think.', \"Yeah.  What our opponents have done here is very skillful, really great at it, and I give them credit for setting up all kinds of straw man arguments, you know, that if you are opposed to immigration, you don't understand that some people who are coming here are patriots and want to be -- well, of course, it's absolutely true.  Nobody's suggesting that every single immigrant comes here under that premise.  But the idea that you -- when you say you can't deport, I don't have any -- I have never once, in as many millions of words as I have expended on this topic, suggested everybody's got to be deported.  All I've ever said is, look, all you have to do is obey the law. All you have to do is restrict the ability of a employer to give a job to somebody who is here illegally.  People self-deport when that happens.  It happened in Arizona.  You do not have to round people up.  These are all cannards.  These are all things that people on the other say to make it look as though we're all people who are just waiting and biding our time until we can get these people out of our country.  That's --\", 'Why is it hard to suggest that obeying the law would be a good way to deal with --', \"-- the immigration problem?  How do you -- what's the deal?\", 'I think I at least attempted to address that when I spoke earlier when I talked about these periods of timeout.  In fact, we have had immigrants --  immigration is an important part of America.  There is nothing -- there is no argument about that.  Its just that it was rational over American history to create an immigration policy that fit the time, that fit the economic situation in the country.  Thats exactly what happened in the 1890s and the 1900s, massive immigration, low-skilled people.  Fine, worked, its okay.  And so you can say over a long period of time, it worked.  Well, it would work again today except that we have never had this timeout.  And we continue to bring in the same category, low-skilled, low-wage worker, even though we dont have enough jobs.', 'What do we -- 30 years from now, could things be better?  Yeah.  I mean, whos supposed to be able to make that determination?  And why would we begin to think about creating -- exacerbating a problem we have today, a massive problem, with unemployment in this country -- 10, well, nobody knows the real percentage. Well, lets settle on whats generally talked about as the real unemployment in America, at 10 percent -- why would we tell all those people who are unemployed today, that theyre going to have to figure out a way to think about their lives as being better in the long run because they cant get a job today.', 'I mean, it makes no sense.', 'Almost every single study on this -- this is one of the -- another area where there is some degree of agreement in the number of studies out there. Hispanic immigrants in America -- although Hispanics make economic and educational gains from the first to the second generation, not disputed, the progress stops there. Third-generation Hispanics still earn significantly less than whites, graduate from college at less than 50 percent of whites, and, by the way, in terms of language, still do not accept English as the primary language, even at the third generation.', 'Well, thats -- okay.  So we have another argument about statistics.', \"Tamar apparently agrees that jobs are the attraction.  Without the jobs, they don't come. Without the jobs, they go back.

But it's a great use of a tool that's out there that would not cost a great deal of money, it's an easy process, and it would have the effect if Tamara's right that people won't come if they hear there's no jobs, it would have the effect I think also of saying I believe if there are no jobs --\", '-- so many [spelled phonetically] people left, by the way --', '-- so many people left in Arizona --', 'I mentioned that I first got into this whole thing because of the intellectual stimulation I believe that it provides.  And I think tonights a good example, that it certainly does that. It is a fascinating discussion, and I sincerely respect the opinions of the people on the other side of this.  I would say that there is, for America, I think all of us at this table want exactly what has been expressed, Julin, by you, certainly an opportunity for people who come here, an opportunity to do great things. I also want for people who live here, for people who are on the lowest rung of the economic ladder in this country to also have an opportunity, to have the ability to actually get a job, progress through the system, and especially the ones -- Im talking about the ones that have done it the right way.  Nothing hurts -- theres no group of people in the United States thats more negatively impacted by massive immigration, both legal and illegal, of low-skilled, low-wage people, than the people who are here legally, who are low-skilled, low-wage people.  They are our citizens.  Why is it so hard for us to think about them, to think about their needs?  For the most part, you know, when were talking about the immigration process and these people, they came the right way.  And, by the way, this has nothing to do with race, ethnicity, absolutely nothing. I assure you that if Italy was on our southern border, had as much poverty, as much population, we would have just as many problems with Italians coming across that border illegally.  Its got nothing to do with ethnicity, nothing.  Although its always tried to be - - people try to cast it in that light because they want to move the discussion away from the real problem and to this bogeyman of racism.  Is it out there?  Of course.  But Ill tell you what, it does not motivate me.  All I want is for this country to achieve its goals.

      "['Use of the VIP lounge in Dili International Airport.  But I will say it is a culmination of a career that began with a foreign relations committee ambassador to Croatia, of ever more important jobs in ever smaller places.', \"It is time to clip America's global wings. America's global ambitions, particularly in the last decade, have far exceeded our capabilities.  It is more than we can afford, more than a trillion dollars on two wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq. But beyond the fact that we can't afford it -- and my colleague, Larry Korb, will make that case, it is that we are not capable of doing it.  We do not need to sit here and debate the rights and wrongs, the moral correctness or the lack of correctness of the Iraq war or the Afghanistan war. The fact is we undertook massive nation building exercises, and we did not succeed.  In fact, I will argue to you that we have not only not helped the United States, we have undermined Americas national security. Now I want to be clear.  Larry Korb and I are not isolationists, we are not against U.S. -- use of U.S. power in the world.  When I served as the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia, I argued strongly for U.S. airstrikes against the Serbs who were attacking Sarajevo and civilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and when those airstrikes took place, they combined with intense diplomacy, they brought a four-year war that had claimed more than 100,000 lives to an end.  It was effective.  Larry Korb and I support the intervention in Libya, and it is -- for the same reason that it is working in Bosnia --  it was in Bosnia and in Libya we had limited ambitions. In Bosnia it was to end the war, in Libya to protect civilians. We had allies in Bosnia, the Europeans picked up more than two-thirds of the cost of reconstruction.  Theyre doing much of the heavy lifting in Libya, and we had partners on the ground.  That is not the case in Iraq or in Afghanistan.  In the case of Iraq, we went in not appreciating the complexities of the government, and in the end, who ended up as the victor? Iran.  For eight years, the Ayatollah Khomeini and the clerical government in Iran fought the Iran-Iraq War, at a cost of a half a million Iranian soldiers for the goal of installing, of getting rid of Saddam Hussein, and of installing in power Dawa and SCIRI, two Iranian-supported Shiite parties.  They failed. In 2003, the U.S. went in, and who is it that is in power in Iraq but the Dawa has the prime ministership, SCIRI plays a major role.  Talk about unintended consequences.  In Afghanistan, the United States is embarked on a counterinsurgency, I want to be clear about the operation we took to remove the Taliban, to drive out -- to try to kill and capture Al-Qaeda was correct, morally justified, endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, but that mission has now morphed into an exercise aimed at building a central government in a country that has never had a strong central government and a counterinsurgency strategy that requires -- if General Petraeus were here, its architect, he would say just what Im going to say -- it requires a local partner for it to work. Our partner in Afghanistan is Hamid Karzai who presides over what transparency internationals described as the second-most corrupt country in the world -- number one is Somalia which doesnt have a government at all -- is ineffective, illegitimate, having stolen his last election through massive fraud, and as a result, the strategy doesnt work. We have invested billions in training an Afghan police force.  Our idea is that by training an Afghan police force, they'll be partners who can provide security, and why do we train the police?  Because thats what we know how to do, but the problem in Afghanistan is the police are the visible face of a corrupt Afghan regime. The money that weve spent building roads so farmers can bring their products to market in Afghanistan isnt working because, yes, the roads are there, farmers dont bring their product to market because the police rip them off by more than the value of the market. We can train the police to be policemen, but we cannot make them honest.  Afghanistan is also another case of the unintended consequences of our actions.  We are spending this year $117 billion on the Afghanistan war.  To fight an enemy, the Taliban, whose budget is estimated between $70 million and $200 million, and how do the Taliban fund themselves?  From the United States. Why?  Because to supply our military in Afghanistan, we bring in supplies to the Pakistani port of Karachi, they go through Taliban-controlled territory.  The contractors pay off the Taliban.  And with the money used to pay for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, we ourselves are financing the Taliban. Now look at this from the point of view from the extremists.  We can spend $70 million and get the U.S. to spend $117 billion.  That is a pretty good investment.  So, our position is simple.  We need to scale back what the United States is doing in the world.  Yes, to continue global engagements.  Yes, to working with allies.  But no to this ambitious overreaching.  Yes to being smart.  So, please join me in supporting the proposition that it is time to clip Americas global wings.

And so one of the ideas of not doing these kinds of things, being selective, having a sensible defense budget is we might actually be able to devote resources in ways that would increase our influence in the world.  You know, we were totally isolated on the issue of global warming. Everybody else recognizes this as a problem.  But the previous administration didn't.  Now, you know, the U.S. is back in the mainstream.  We didn't need to pull out of Kyoto.  We could have consulted.

Its about -- whats happening in the Middle East is not because they sat down and they read Jefferson or the Federalist Papers.  It is an indigenous movement of people in the Arab world, and its terrific.  But it isnt because of something that weve done or not done.  But we have the potential by intervening, as we did in Iraq with an expansive nation-building exercise, as weve done in Afghanistan, as were still doing, try and build a central government where none has existed, of undermining our credibility of wasting our resources.  We have to remember that military power is not the end-all and be-all of power.  Power is a lot of things.  Influence doesnt always come at the point of a gun.  It may relate to your prestige.  In 2000, Americas prestige was sky-high, again, after Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor. We had a lot of influence in the world.  We exercised a lot of military power in this last decade.  And by the end of the previous administration, our power and our influence in the world, our ability to make things happen, was rock-bottom.  Were climbing back, but its awfully slow.']\n",
      "[\"What's not adding up is that the Republican Party has changed tremendously since the days of Reagan. Remember when -- in the Reagan administration, when we got into Lebanon, it didn't work, Reagan got out.  He raised taxes 11 times when he recognized that supply-side economics was not working.  He worked with members of Congress to reform the Social Security system that kept it in balance until this year.\", 'Well, I thought I would take advantage of it.', \"My point is that even if you think the United States should be more involved in the world, the problem is right now we're broke.  We borrow 41 cents of every dollar that the federal government spends.  We borrow -- put it another way -- $4 billion a day.  Now, if you go back and you take a look -- and I know our opponents don't want to talk about the previous administration. Go back to the beginning of this century.  The beginning of this century, the United States accounted for one-third of the world's Gross Domestic Product.  We spent one- third of what the world spends on military.  Here we are today, we account for only one quarter of the world's Gross Domestic Product, but yet we account for half of the world's military expenditures.  Five percent of the world's population, which is us, spends half of what the rest of the world spends on defense.  Now, remember at the beginning of this century, we had a budget surplus.  You may remember the lockbox and all of those debates back in 2000.  That surplus was supposed to make sure that Social Security would not run out of money quicker than it has.  Where did we end up at the end of this decade?  Not with a surplus of about five trillion, but with a deficit of five trillion.  And then, of course, when the global economic crisis hit, we had to increase the deficit even more. Now, the question becomes, how do we get there?  Defense played a part.  The war has played a part.  It wasn't the only part, but I think it's important to keep in mind, in 1968, when we had 540,000 people in Vietnam, we balanced the budget.  How did we do it? We had a surtax, a war surtax.  What happened this time?  You can be for or against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  But the fact of the matter is we went to war, and we didn't pay for it.  In fact, what we did is we cut taxes.  We've never done that in our -- in our history.  And what happened? The wars cost -- the direct cost a little over a trillion dollars so far.  But the indirect costs, as a lot of economists will tell us, we'll be paying for a long time.  And Joe Stiglitz up here, a Columbia economist, estimates it'll cost three to $5 trillion. We compounded it during that time by increasing the defense budget, what we call the baseline budget.  General McChrystal, who everybody knows, I had the privilege of working with at the Council on Foreign Relations about 10 years ago.  Before he went to Afghanistan, basically he was on the joint staff and in charge of the baseline budget.  And he told me, when I spoke to him the last time, he said, we didn't have to make any choices.  We could have everything.  The baseline budget also went up during this particular period.  Again, during Vietnam and during Korea which had war costs, we looked into the baseline budget of the programs that didn't contribute to our national security.  Now, you don't think the deficit's a problem?  Admiral Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it's the biggest threat to national security.  And he says unless we get our economic house in order at home, we can't be strong abroad.  Now, the defense and I agree with it.  Wasn't the only thing. We as individuals live beyond our means.  We all assume that housing prices were going to go up 30 percent a year.  And, you know, we made our decisions on that basis.  States right now are having a lot of problems because when they had the pension funds for the policemen, the firemen, the teachers, they assumed they would grow eight percent a year. Well, that didn't happen, and they're having problems.  Now, the question becomes, okay, now we have these problems.  Maybe we should still do a lot more in the world.  And again, we're not against involvement.  But it has to be selective engagement.  You can't deal with every situation.  But we've got a lot of challenges at home.  You probably have seen all of the statistics.  We're 15th in reading, 17th in science, 25th in math.  These are our children.  Our infrastructure is falling apart.  We're 27th in life expectancy.  You know, right now, but we are ahead in a couple of things. Obesity is one, and we're also basically first in the amount of debt that we have and the number of people who are below the poverty -- poverty line.  And what we're doing, as a country, we're living off our past investments.  If you go back and look where we are today, these are all investments we made in the '50s and the '60s.  Now, can you cut defense?  Yeah, you sure can.  If you take a look at what we're spending on defense, and you put it in constant dollars, go back and look at the Cold War average, it was 450 billion.  Right now it's 550 billion. How do I know it's too much?  Secretary of Defense says $150 billion in inefficiencies.  Well, we could take that money and use it to deal with some of the problems at home.  And a couple of things, you know, that we could take a look at in terms of if we get back to where we are -- Secretary Gates, Secretary of Defense goes to West Point.  Were not going to send large land armies into Muslim countries again, okay? This is a man who worked for President Reagan, worked for President Bush, is now working for President Obama.  Well, if youre not going to do that, lets take a look at the size of the Army and the Marine Corps.  This is something that you can do.  We also have to recognize as a country that not all problems can be solved, nor can we solve them all.  And I think, as Peter pointed out, I think Libyas the perfect example of the way to do that.  We used our unique capabilities, we got other people involved, and you know whos a great example for this, the first President Bush.  You may remember in the campaign, President Obama said, I like President Bush, and everybody said, You do? and he said, Well, the first President Bush.  The first Persian Gulf War we got over 200,000 troops from other nations, and those who couldnt send troops, we collected money.  We collected so much, we actually made a profit on the war.  So it didnt cost us anything and, in conclusion, weve done it before. Eisenhower got us out of Korea, wouldnt go into Hungary and Poland, or into Vietnam. Nixon got us out of Vietnam, started arms control with the Soviet Union, recognized China, and even Reagan, when he started negotiating with the Russians, you know what Newt Gingrich called him?  Neville Chamberlain.  Thank you very much. [applause]\", 'Yeah, but how bad an idea could it have been?', 'But let me say something here.  Let me say something here.', \"What we're talking about here is -- and you mention my Republican thing -- the way the Republicans always look at cost benefits. You want to quote someone?  Let me quote one of your colleagues, Fukiyama, who wrote the book, The End of History and talked about --\", 'He was one of the --', '-- supporters of the war.  But you know, Frank said -- and he supported the war, he said, if you had told the American people in 2003, we\\'re going to go to war in Iraq, and we\\'re going to have almost 5,000 Americans die, 30 to 40,000 wounded, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis die, spend over a trillion dollars so Iraq could have an election, you would have been laughed out of the ballpark.  You\\'ve got to have select -- I remember growing up in New York City at the time of the Polish and Hungarian revolutions.  And you had a lot of people from Eastern Europe here.  And basically, they wanted the United States to do something.  How can you stand by?  I remember pictures of Cardinal Mindszenty on the head of The Daily News, \"We\\'ve got to do --\" no. Eisenhower made a calculation.  When they wanted them to bail out the French at Dien Bien Phu. General Ridgway came to them and said, Hey, here\\'s the cost.  He said, Forget it. Bedell Smith, go to --', 'Oh, sure.', 'No, we shouldnt -- [talking simultaneously] Lawrence Korb: He was contained.', \"I think -- and we get back -- look, there's a lot of evil in the world, and you have to decide whether the potential benefits are worth the costs that you have to pay.  And that's why if you had told the American people that in the beginning, regardless of the outcome, you never would have gotten support.  If you had asked people to raise taxes and to have a draft, which we should have done because of the fact that we overworked a lot of these young people, sent them back -- when I was in government, we got the voluntary military going. We made a compact with the young people.  For every year you spend in the combat zone, you get at least two years at home.  It didn't work.  Okay, you got 500,000 people, according to RAND, who have mental problems because of being over-deployed.\", 'Wait, wait.  Wait a second.', 'We went in with --', \"-- Bill Clinton's military, the one you said wasnt big enough.  It wasnt Bush's military that went in.\", 'And we were spending on defense, about half on the baseline of what were spending now.  And we marched through Baghdad in three weeks.', 'Now wait a second, wait a second.  Lets go back and take a look.  You look at the discretionary budget, the budget that doesnt deal with entitlements, things that people have earned, like military retirement, these thing -- if you look at discretion -- defense is half of the discretionary budget.  And right now the politicians of Washington have frozen nondefense discretionary.  Thats not going to help, I agree we need to take a look at the other things.  I mentioned President Reagan in 1983 worked on it.  But the fact of the matter is you dont just ignore half of the discretionary budget, particularly if you cut it. And you mentioned Alice Rivlin.  Did you read the report of the Domenici-Rivlin Commission? Male Speaker: No. Male Speaker: She said cut $100 billion in defense by 2015.', 'Now, let me come back --', 'Let me make a point here, because I agree.  We went into Afghanistan.  The problem was and this is what Im talking about, clipping your wings, selective engagement.  You didnt finish the job in Afghanistan.  You diverted your attention to Iraq. And you allowed Afghanistan to deteriorate.  I agree, Afghanistan was the right war. And, in fact, I commended President Bush because he told -- in the beginning, he said to the Taliban, You turn over al-Qaeda, well leave you alone.  They didnt, so we went in.  We had to.  The problem was, within months, we started diverting our attention to Iraq, which was not a critical issue, had nothing to do with 9/11.  Back when Eisenhower was president, we were spending 10 percent of the GDP on defense, we didnt go into Vietnam.', 'No, no, no, no.  Were not saying that.  Were saying trying to run the world does cost you a lot of money that you dont have to spend.  And, even if --', 'If you had all the money, you got to look at selective engagement.  You cannot save the world, okay?  There are a lot of problems in the world that you cant deal with that you have to live with.  You ask me whats the most dangerous place in the world?  Pakistan. All right?  You want to send troops into Pakistan?  Okay?  Youre not going to do that. And, again, you should have thought about that before you went into, you know, you went into Iraq and took your eye off the ball in Afghanistan.', \"Since you used a metaphor here, there's a great book written by a professor here at this wonderful university, Peter Beinart.  It's called The Icarus Syndrome. And he said throughout our history, we get carried away thinking that because of who we are we can solve all the world's problems. And he goes back, and he talks about Vietnam where we went in, we thought the domino theory and all of that type of thing, found out we even -- when our economy was much better, we still could not achieve the objective that we wanted.  And that's what -- you used the term, you've got to be smart about it, there are certain things you've got to do, other things you realize that they're beyond your capacity.  And I think that's the key thing. Now, at this particular time, we talk about the fact that defense has nothing to do with it.  No.  We added $2 trillion to the deficit in the last decade because of actions that happened from 2001 to 2008, okay?  If we had those $2 trillion, the other problems would not be as bad.  And so that's the point I'm making.\", 'Well, Im going to [unintelligible] very quickly --', 'Okay.', \"I have very quick [unintelligible].  Multilateral if you can, unilateral only if you must.  I think that's what you have to do, and you have to basically ask yourself that question and the same thing in terms of what you can't know exactly ahead of time but you can do a pretty good idea of the cost and the benefits and recognize that you don't just use the military to solve all these problems.\", 'Well, my response to them is basically if you take a look at a lot of the operations we do, they havent done that ahead of time in terms of the cost and the benefits.', 'According to Colin Powell --', '-- Bush never did that before he went into Iraq.', 'Let me go --', 'I think you raise a great point.  China is gaining because were bogged down in Afghanistan.  They would love us to be there forever, keep spending all of this money and help their a foreign policy objectives.  Theyre a free rider in the Middle East.  Were doing -- whats China doing?  Sitting back and taking advantage of it.  So I think our point is that, you know, when you say clip your wings, youve got to work with the rest of the community. We cant have too many free riders.  Its very interesting when the deficit came up in Britain and France, they cut their defense spending.   They cut it.  And then, of course, who has to pick up the thing?  We do.  Well, Im glad that President Obama said, Wait a second.  You have more interest in Libya than we do.  And Im glad that the international community did it.  So, I think youre going to look at China.  Theyre doing great because theyre a free rider.', \"No.  And I think basically Obama did it exactly right.  The cost to put ground troops on there was too great.  The cost to the American defense budget and the taxpayer in terms of doing it all by ourselves was too great.  So basically, this operation after the first week is costing us $40 million a month.  Basically, that's affordable.  How much is Afghanistan costing?  How much is Iraq costing?  That's what I'm talking about, you've got to do the - - you know, do the cost benefits.  And he decided that, yes, we would like Gaddafi to be gone. Every -- we'd like a lot of these people to be gone. But in terms of the cost to do that, it would -- to put ground troops on and all that was just too great.  And I think we have actually moved away in our military strategy the way we were doing it in Yemen with the Special Forces and the drones, the way we're doing it in Pakistan and the drones.  That is a cost benefit way to do it rather than sending in large numbers of ground troops.\", \"Yeah.  You've got to confront these violent extremists basically not by killing them. Rumsfeld said you can't kill all the terrorists.  Basically, what you have to do is undermine their narrative.  And by going into Iraq, which turned out to be for the wrong reasons, you enhance the al-Qaeda narrative.  And so I think what we have to do is live up to our values at home, and that will help.  I mean, Peter was talking about the fact that the American opinion around the world has gone up.  That's important.  That's how you're going -- you're not going to be able to kill them all.  You have to undermine their narrative.  You know the American opinion in the Muslim world went up when we -- after we helped the people in Indonesia.\", \"Well, it means you don't use your military to do it.  It's basically you live at home --\", 'Yes, yes, I am saying that, yeah.', 'Since youve mentioned it --', 'Oh, oh, okay.', \"Let me go back -- I was, in the beginning, questioned on my Republican credentials by quoting a couple of Republican presidents, though, I think summarize the point that Peter and I have been trying to make.  Maybe Im missing something here, but we should encourage people who live in those lands -- he asked about nation building -- to build their own nations, George Bush, 2000, when he was running for president.  You remember the humble foreign policy. Thats the point were trying to make.  Let me quote from another Republican.  Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signified in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.  If you take a look at what the Republican Party today, if you look at Paul Ryan and what hes proposing, he wants to increase defense spending and then cut the things that are not going to help us improve our standing in science, are not going to help us be more competitive in the world.  And what were opposed to, by clipping the wings, is to get over these reckless military adventures that weve undertaken in the first part of this century, something we hadnt really done since Vietnam. And let me conclude with this.  Youve heard all the apocalyptic scenarios.  I remember when people said, if you got out of Vietnam, all Southeast Asia and Communism and all that kind of stuff. Elliott meant you were going back to Cam Ranh Bay.  I spent a little bit of time there, you know, about 40 years ago.  Why are we going back?  This is the people that we basically recognized we could not make them what we would like them to be.  But they're doing okay now.  And I think that's the point we want to make.  We can't do it all.  We're going to have to clip our wings when something happens.  But look inside all your clothes and things like that.  Go down to Nike and find out where your running shoes are made. That turned out pretty well, even though we clipped our wings back in the '70s.\"]\n",

      "['Thats a great question.  I have four kids, my wife, family of six.  So, I have a lot of options.  We have our own fleet. I did just, because Im commuting, buy a 1999 Saab that gets a little over 30 miles to the gallon.', 'I was driven for four years in a row so I had to do something other than find a driver.', \"Thanks, John.  And thank you for being here tonight to discuss what I think is one of the most important issues that we have, really, as a nation facing us.  You know, Americans are not a group of people that sit out a revolution.  If you think about our founding and where we come from, we began with a revolution, the American Revolutionary War. And there have been a few revolutions in our time as well that Americans have not just participated in, but theyve led.  Think about the Industrial Revolution where we established really our ability to be an economic powerhouse. Or, more recently, the information revolution where we reaffirmed in the minds of the world our ability as innovators and creators and inventors, people who really understand the power of technological development.  What is this revolution that is upon us now?  It is the clean energy revolution.  And its global.  And the question we have before us as Americans is will we lead or will we follow?  Will we accept a place on the sidelines, or will we actively participate in moving this issue ahead? Tonight Im joined by Kassia Yanosek, whos my partner in this.  And youre going to get to hear Kassia as well, but we stand for the proposition tonight that, in fact, clean energy can drive Americas economic recovery.  Energy itself, if you think about the revenues generated globally, the largest industry in terms of revenue generation. So, if we get it right, it absolutely can be a significant part of our economic recovery. And its important for us to define the terms to some extent. When people hear clean energy in a lot of places in the world, they think its just wind or just solar.  Kassia and I tonight, were going to talk about clean energy in this broad spectrum.  It is about renewable, about solar and wind and geothermal biomass, but its also about all those parts of the spectrum that involve the things that were doing to promote clean energy, and the research and development laboratories across this country, both public and private, how you commercialize that technology and get it into the marketplace, those things that involve transmission and Smart Grid technology that help us to manage loads on grid, those parts of the clean energy world that involve transportation -- think electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles, hybrid cars -- but again, the broad spectrum. When we think about clean energy, we do think about natural gas and believe that natural gas and nuclear and even clean coal can perhaps play a role in building out a clean energy economy in America and that it has to be every part of that, from stem to stern, in terms of our thinking about it.  Its important for us to understand as well that workforce development has to be part of our policy considerations. So one of the reasons Im here tonight and one of the reasons I was fortunate to be invited is because, as the Colorado governor, I said in Colorado, Were going to build a new energy economy.  And I said this when I was campaigning, and over a four-year period, I signed 57 different bills into law, bills that we believe made a tremendous difference as it related to our energy portfolio going forward, but particularly relevant to tonights topic, made a significant difference in our ability to see economic development attached to clean energy.  One of those bills was a renewable energy standard bill in the first 100 days that took us to a 20 percent standard by 2020 with a rate cap in place for consumers. In fact, last year, the utility and I, after talking with each other, said, you know what?  We can get to 30 percent by 2020 with the same rate cap in place.  So, as a state, weve got a 30 percent renewable energy standard.  But in those 57 bills, we did Smart metering, meaning people who were residential and industrial consumers could actually get paid if they put energy back onto the grid.  We did a variety of things to inspire the bill out of transmission, inspire new technology, energy efficiency.  When we talk about clean energy, energy efficiency is one of the most significant things we as a country can do to move this country in a direction toward, in fact, a clean energy economy.  So Im not going to go through the 57 bills, but what Ill tell you is the proof is in the pudding.  We have significant economic development tied to that, and Ill give you just a couple of examples.  Vestas wind turbines, the Danish company, building wind turbines in Colorado, made the announcement just after I made the -- signed the bill. That allowed us to go to a 20 percent by 2020, they in fact then have four factories since that theyve announced that, at the end of the day, its going to be 2,600 employees, a billion dollar investment.  SMA, its a German company -- theyre manufacturing solar inverters in Colorado for the first time outside of Germany.  We have home-grown companies, companies, again, where the technology was developed in a laboratory in Colorado we have, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory or one of our research universities, or even private laboratories. One of the thin-film photovoltaic technologies was developed in a Lockheed Martin laboratory, and so weve commercialized that and see these companies grow from the ground up.  Weve seen all sorts of growth in this sector, even during a recession.  And its not just Colorado.  If you look around the country, in places in the Midwest, in the South, in the Southeast, in California, in the Northeast, here in New York, weve all sorts of investments in clean energy that is related to job growth. If you look at the last 10 years and if you look at Michigan for example where they've had terrible job loss.  In many of their conventional sectors, theyve seen job increases, a 5.7 percent increase in jobs in Michigan over the last decade.  Colorado had an 18 percent increase and as John said were the fourth if you look at where we stand, we are fourth in terms of how we have clean tech workers as a state.  Now in my last minute Im just going to tell you theres a reason for doing this thats beyond just the economic development.  We have a powerful example in Colorado, powerful examples around the country that demonstrate economic development as a part of this.  But therere a couple of other things that are very important too.  When you build out a clean energy economy, you actually do something in a very significant way to address the environmental challenges that are upon us.  Even if you dont believe that global warming is human caused there are still significant environmental challenges.  They are a part of a carbon based energy production sector. And in addition to that you wind up addressing another very serious problem we have in this country which is energy security.  Domestically produced energy does a variety of things including reducing our trade deficit and reducing it in such a way that we can look and say the health of the country is better going forward because we have proposed an agenda that relies upon domestically produced energy.  Its the trifecta, right?  It is about energy security, its about environmental security, and its about economic security. Thank you very much. [applause]\", 'Well, I think thats -- I disagree that Kassia should be thrown out of this debate. [laughter] I think that that would be a problem --', 'That would be an awful thing for my team.  But why are we talking about clean?  I mean --', 'No, we say new energy -- the energy sources arent new.  The energy sources have all been there, but the transfer has been to talking about clean because we care about emissions. And thats really what -- I mean, why do we do this at all?  Because we care about what we emit.  And if you dont buy into human change or human-caused climate change, there are still serious environmental hazards that happen from burning hydrocarbons, right, so we care about clean.  And think about an industry thats focused on people using less energy, and actually, by using less energy, bringing down the cost of energy, that would be the cleanest form of energy because youre not emitting at all.  So, weve done a variety of things as a state that looks at how we go into homes where people have fixed incomes, low incomes, but they dont have very efficient homes and we try and do what we can to modernize those homes and bring down their energy costs.', 'Well, no, I mentioned energy efficiency somewhere in my opening and probably didnt give it enough play perhaps because I do think that it is this powerful part of our thinking about clean energy, that we can build an industry around it.  And, quite frankly, a lot of that industry has to do with the construction industry.  If you look at this goal that we would reduce our emissions by 80 percent by 2050, there are people -- scientists -- who believe that we could get there, 40 percent of the way there, just by retrofitting the built environment, and thats about energy efficiency.', 'I really cant imagine that youre saying that we should not -- that we should sustain this level of emissions from coal burning plants that we currently have.', 'No, no, its not because you can look at the different kinds of things that we are undertaking to lessen emissions.  And if youd rather, the operating principle here is that we should look at emissions.  You pick out sulfur dioxide.  Weve done a good job with sulfur dioxide, but if you put in place -- lets take natural gas -- natural gas, you decreased sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxygen by 70 to 80 percent. You wipe out the mercury.  So youre not mentioning mercury.  We have lakes in this country we dont eat fish out of because of the mercury that is part of coal pollutant.', 'You can eliminate the mercury through natural gas services as well.', '[unintelligible] in Colorado, coal, without any price on carbon, is six cents a kilowatt hour.  Wind is about nine.  Coal can get to 6.5.  Wind is at nine.  And when I became governor, solar was 40 percent more than it is now.  In a four-year period, solar came down 40 percent.  Still not competitive with wind if you just say apples to apples, but this is the kind of argument that you hear from you guys.  And Im thinking here about the flat screen TV.  It was $15,000 a TV four years ago, and now its $350. So we give up on flat screen TVs because they cost way too much.  This is something thats happened and as, I think, Kassia said, this is happening around the world, that people are looking for clean energy alternatives.  Youve got wind without a price on carbon very close to coal.  Youve got solar coming down 40 percent, and it is our -- incumbent upon us to be innovators and --', \"Well, again -- so, here, we develop wind farms, we develop them from start to finish in the State of Colorado.  We've got a fellow thats got 112 turbines on his land, hes making about $5,000 per turbine, so its a half a million dollars that hes earning in income and hes got 68 acres out of production, 68 acres, hes still able to farm, this is -- hes a wheat farmer, still able to farm all of that. And time, after time, after time not only have we seen the ability to put up a wind farm but weve seen the economic development possibilities for rural Colorado in an industry that, quite frankly, sort of lives at the margin.  Think about the Mohave Desert right now where theyre building out solar and theyre doing concentrated solar power with natural gas, and this is why I dont accept that we have this either/or.  Its this false choice.  The folks at Bright Source have 2.6 gigawatts of purchase power agreements with Southern California, and so theyre going to build out these solar towers, and theyre going to put natural gas turbines on there, and if you look at the emissions, back to thinking about it in terms of emissions, if the sun shines like its supposed to in the desert, and the rest of its natural gas, they get 24-hour power, but they reduce emissions 75 percent in that 2.6 gigawatts of power going into Southern California.\", \"Well that's not true about wind--\", \"-- that's not true at all about wind, we've got Vestas wind turbines, that's 2,600 jobs.  You can't make small of 2,600 jobs in a state like Colorado, it's five million people.  And a variety of other parts of the wind manufacturing sector.  And, quite frankly, you have it in Pennsylvania, you have it, I think, in Ohio, you have it in Iowa.  Where there is wind manufacturing, you cannot do those jobs in Canada, or China, and that's part of the reason Vestas located there.  But even as it relates to solar.  I wonder if there's a debate in China tonight, where they're saying, you know, SunTech moved to Arizona, and they're making things in Arizona, and so, this is a bad thing for us to do in China, to invest in an innovation economy. They're not doing that. And there are solar companies that are coming here, manufacturing here, from China. There's exports we have to China.  And the solar industry itself is a net exporter outside of the United States.  It exports more than it brings in.\", 'If Dan Reicher were here and not stuck behind an avalanche in Utah, he would now tell a joke about a fridge to the future because he talks about refrigerators as this way to think about energy efficiency and, you know, the energy use of those refrigerators has come down, theres greater volume, and 75 percent less energy use since the early 1970s because of a commitment to innovation.  Youre right.  You know, as it relates to the PDA, theyre very -- they go to data centers.  Those data centers consume a lot of energy. That makes our point, right. We cant keep the demand for energy growing.  You said at one point in time that its less, but then you just said its more.  And I think, you know, you look at IBM.  IBM understands they use data centers very heavily, and you know what IBMs made a commitment to? Green energy.  And theyve made a commitment to clean energy because they understand that there are costs maybe apart from just the economic costs of continuing to have this industry that uses so much energy rely on fossil fuels or rely heavily on coal.  So IBM in Colorado has the greenest data center I think, maybe, in America, and they did it specifically because of their energy demand growing and not wanting to be viewed as a polluter.', \"Im going to respond to this a little bit differently.  I lived in Zambia for three years as a Catholic missionary and Im telling you we could do all sorts of things in innovating products that we could export to very, very poor countries where their ability to use energy differently could help them expand their economies in a ways that we don't now think of. In the university that I'm now at, Colorado State University, we developed a two-cycle engine at that university that really can reduce emissions in a tremendous way.  If you think about India and the use the two cycle engine, so.  We have, actually, this other thing that's, apart from just the economic driver, we have this other thing that happens with innovation, that can be very positive for some of the poorest places in the world.\", 'So that sounds like that could drive the economic recovery in America, to do that, right? [laughter] [applause]', \"Natural gas is only one part of it, though.  We're getting, I mean, and I agree, it is a part of it.  We actually are promoting the use of natural gas.  But to focus it solely on that fossil fuel is still --\", \"No, I wasn't saying that at all.  But I do think, I didn't say that oil was dirty.  What I said is, we have a supply of natural gas, it is cleaner burning, we have the technology and government sponsored the natural gas turbine to get to a place where it became more efficient, and increased its efficiency by 30 percent. Interesting that it was a government subsidy that actually made that happen, but the fact of the matter is that natural gas or oil should not be the only part of our portfolio.  If we really look at this from an emissions perspective, you get a 50 percent reduction in emissions at best from natural gas when you transfer it from coal.  But with a portfolio that includes all these other things, we can get to this 80 percent reduction by 2050.  We cant get to there from a natural gas -- [talking simultaneously]\", 'No, I dont think its irresponsible at all.  This is totally achievable.  This is totally achievable through a variety of strategies that include investment in clean energy, that includes renewables, that includes nuclear, that we can look, and weve said clean coal -- people are like, whats clean coal? Well there is also --', 'Whats that?', 'Well, no, Im not able to sitting right here, but what Im telling you is that its absolutely achievable and the reason its achievable.  So, I dont know --', 'Can I finish one thing?  Steven Chus a -- hes a Nobel laureate, right.  Hes the secretary of Energy, and what hell tell you is that 40 percent of those emissions reductions you get from retrofitting the built environment, so its not about growing the portfolio.  Its about finding ways to do energy efficiency.', 'So there are three things that the government policy can include: a public strategy that helps invest in the innovation -- that can be a part of it.  And government policy can certainly be helping think about ways that there are financial instruments. And there are instruments apart from subsides that also lead to investment.  Therere a variety of things municipal governments can do, state governments can do that are financial mechanisms.  And so, if you have the technology and you have the finance in place, then you look at sort of the other policies that might spur the kind of innovation, and that was our experience in Colorado, that our renewable energy standard absolutely made a significant difference in jobs coming to the state because there was a market certainty.', 'Well, we went to 30, and we went to 30 with a two percent rate cap.', 'Well, because we couldnt get the coalition of people that I believe were necessary for us to do it to make a wise policy --', 'We got to 30 with a two percent rate cap, thats a pretty good thing to be, the second most aggressive renewable energy standard and to do that with people at the table agreeing that it was possible and achievable.', 'Well, that wasnt mentioned in your -- thats fair enough, but you didnt mention it.', 'Im not a fan of ethanol.', \"Thank you.  Thank you very much for your time and your attention tonight.  This is a debate that's far more important than any kind of political slogan, or any kind of politicking.  This is a debate that I think has everything to do with the economic future of this state, this country, and quite frankly, the future for our kids and our grandkids. And people who think that Americans don't care what kind of power source delivers electricity through a light bulb are wrong about that.  Everything that I've seen, in terms of public opinion polling, says that Americans absolutely do care that we make investments in clean energy. Why do they care about it?  They care about it because they believe that, in this place, America, that we are inventors, that we are creators.  You can look at costs and say, Costs of this, and that's why coal will be, going forward, 40 percent of our energy. That's a static view of the world.  It doesn't take into account the tremendous cost curve reductions that we've seen in a variety of places that are absolutely non-carbon sources of energy, solar, wind, and things of that nature.  And, quite frankly, Americans believe in the star [spelled phonetically] of innovation and creation, and say, Yeah, we can do it. We can do it with the right set of policies.  And we're not here defending every subsidy and saying it has to happen this way, in a subsidized way. What we're saying is, if you put the right set of policies in place to support taxing -- sorry -- financing, technology, and those things that help bring technologies forward and move them forward, then you get to a place where you can see a vision for a clean energy economy that can be part of this economic recovery.  States across the country have seen job growth because they committed investments and innovation.  They committed policy to this, and theyve seen job growth in this sector and no other sector.  And thats just one laboratory.  If we did it at the federal level and we did it as a nation, we would see economic recovery in this sector even in the place where were slow to recover in a variety of other sectors because its a global market and a global demand.  Thank you.\"]\n",
      "['Well, first of all, I love frogs.  And Im willing to hold one in a business suit.  But it was a function I went to in the U.K. for the Princes Rain Forest project, so it was --', 'It was a promotional.', 'No, it was a video effect.', 'Thank you.  Again, my name is Kassia Yanosek and I come to you tonight as an investor. Ive been an investor in the energy sector for the past decade, and I used to invest in dirty energy. My background includes investing at Bechtel Enterprises, the private equity arm of Bechtel which is a large engineering firm.  I also worked at BP.  So I started out my career investing in coal and gas.  And, you know, as an investor, I look for the biggest growth markets.  So thats why Im a clean energy investor right now.  I dont sit in an ivory tower or a think tank.  Instead, I often sit in airplane seats, travel around the country, roll up my sleeves, meet with energy innovators and entrepreneurs, and I figure out where to create value in this economy, which is why were here tonight.  And this is what were talking about tonight.  You know, most recently, before starting my firm, I was a senior member of a billion dollar private equity firm thats deployed millions of capital in the sector of clean energy.  I currently invest with New York investment houses around the subject of innovation and clean energy technologies, and thats where I think the opportunities are in this market.  So Im going to give you the real story tonight about why clean energy will drive our economic recovery. The other thing Id like to point out is that I actually dont think we should be having this debate -- not will it or wont it drive economic prosperity but how it can drive our economy.  We need to start competing and get out from behind our computers where we write op-eds, stop resting on our laurels of the past, stop wimping out about how China is going to cream us.  Is that any way to win a match or a race?  So my goal tonight is to convince us that we can continue to be an innovation leader in other sectors that weve done in the past, and that clean energy is the next growth market for the U.S. And heres why clean energy can drive economic growth.  Im going to give you three reasons. First of all, innovation in new industries drives job creation and investment, and Im going to provide some examples, from I.T. to the auto industry, and also why government has in the past, and it needs to continue to be, an integral part of this growth for the energy sector. Number two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth.  So, instead of complaining about China, lets start competing so we can sell into China.  And then, third, we do need to talk about our dependence on oil.  Oil does not help economic recovery.  Our dependence on oil doesnt help economic recovery; it actually hinders economic recovery.  So we actually need a broad menu of energy options to reduce our dependence on any one commodity, which smoothes out volatility and helps our economy grow. So, point number one: innovation drives job creation and lower costs in our energy sector.  You know, we can see this in our I.T. markets.  We now lead the world in research, product, and deployment.  And certainly, Silicon Valley has been a huge driving force of the U.S. economy. Right now, I believe that about 16 percent of our total exports are related to advanced technologies.  Well, guess what? That wasnt part of our economy 30 to 40 years ago, so clean energy has a great future ahead of it if were going to actually put our heads together and start innovating.  And government was a big part of that.  DARPA which is an arm of the government was instrumental in the development of the Internet. And secondly, the auto industry -- dinosaur industry.  You know, we got our pants beat off by Japan.  But guess what?  Detroit is turning around.  Were starting to see Ford and Chevrolet start developing electric vehicles.  Theres a lot of activity out there, and its winning accolades. So it really debunks this view that we cant afford to have this job creation in the United States. And then, finally, without going too much into the weeds, Ill point out some obvious statistics about how clean energy is driving investment in jobs.  Last year, $243 billion was invested in clean energy globally.  This is essentially a 25 percent compound average growth rate that weve seen over the past five years.  And this is really one of the biggest drivers that were seeing in the markets today. In the past 10 years clean jobs grew 9.1 percent in the United States while total jobs grew by only 3.7 percent.  So I have a little bit of different perspective and some different statistics than my opponents over there.  And then, finally, Ill point out that costs are coming down, count down the curve.  Electric batteries cost about $1,000 a kilowatt hour two years ago; today its about half that, and were on track for some very competitive technology that were going to see in our electric vehicles within the next 10 years.  So were starting to see a real big steepness in the innovation curve. Point two, clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth.  Its important that we grow a domestic market not only for us but for our export markets.  Its an opportunity worth trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.  My opponent actually pointed out a very important point: There is not a whole lot of energy growth going on in the U.S. and in the next 10-20 years. Ninety percent of the growth and energy consumption over the next two decades is going to come from developing countries. So we better get on that so we can actually benefit from the growth that were going to see in these export markets.  So, finally, we need to learn from the information technology industry. We need to develop the energy economy the way we did the I.T. And were starting to do that. Clean tech really is where information technology was 30 years ago and where biotech was 20 years ago.  So were at the beginning of a very long and prosperous future for this sector.  And then, point three, we need a portfolio of energy choice.  Dependence on fossil fuels doesnt help economic recovery.  As I said, it actually hinders it.  You know, were seeing $100 oil.  Weve seen this happen before, and price spikes really do not help the economy.  Rising energy prices act as a drag on GDP growth.  A 10 percent oil shock is -- could actually lower GDP growth by .2 percent per year for the next two years, and thats a recent statistic that Goldman Sachs just put out. Were also seeing that high oil prices can increase inflation which compresses corporate margins, impacts the consumers, so when we talk about the price of energy, I dont necessarily see that the current state of affairs in fossil fuel is helping the energy economy in keeping costs down for consumers.  So, essentially, with that, Im going to close with bringing you back to the focus of this debate, which is that clean energy can drive the future of our economy.  And, frankly, if youre not for the clean energy economy, then youre not for economic recovery.  Thank you. [applause]', \"Sure.  Well, I think that, you know, first of all, we're going to have to define what clean energy is.  Clean energy is not just wind and solar, which I agree makes up a very small portion, less than eight percent, of our global, of our U.S. power generation.  We have to include cleaner sources, cleaner ways to develop and produce energy that's being produced from coal, and natural gas, and nuclear.  So when we talk about clean energy and the opportunity for economic growth we're not just limiting ourselves to renewables here. We're actually bringing in the opportunity to bring down costs, improve efficiency.  One thing we haven't even started talking about tonight is actually energy efficiency, and the opportunities there.  So, first, I would say that, number one, this is not a small industry. This is a huge industry.  And there's so much opportunity --\", '[affirmative]', 'Wind and solar make up about five percent of our global power generation, in the, well, definitely in the United States, less in the --', \"It's certainly growing by leaps and bounds, but, and so, as an investor, I care about growth, and where the best opportunities for investment are.  So certainly the growth is happening in the renewable sector, and much higher growth rates than traditional energy.\", \"But I would say that, when we're talking about, how do you grow the clean economy, it's about growing opportunity, broadly-speaking.  And there are new innovations we haven't even thought about, I mean, think about the electric vehicle market. We didnt think about building that market 10 years ago, so there are step changes that we havent seen that we need to be innovating for now.\", 'The motion is about clean, and its how you define clean.', 'I think the governor had a very strong point that clean is about -- it could be defined as reducing emissions.  And so, by improving the efficiency of a coal fire power plant and natural gas turbines, that, in our definition, is clean.', 'Well, actually, I think youre wrong on that point.  I mean, if you look at the numbers, and I know youve got the numbers because you said clearly you have all the numbers. [laughter]', 'You know, the IEA, for example, has done a study of the amount of subsidies that go for the fossil fuel generation globally.  I believe that number last year was 312 billion.  For renewables, it was about 37 billion. So were not really comparing apples to apples here.  So Ill just start with that.  But secondly, I want to clear up this point about what --', '[unintelligible] talking about the history of energy innovation and technology development, and if you look back through the history of how these costs came down the cost curve because it was not always that easy and that cheap to drill for oil and natural gas.  Governments had to be involved; these industries had to be helped along with industry.', 'Well, first of all, Im a fan of frogs, but not of bats, so Im not actually going to take that argument on. [laughter]', \"But, again, I'm a frog person, so I'm just going to [unintelligible]. [laughter]\", \"But I want to go back to this, you know, definition of clean energy and the cost issue because there's something that we have not really been able to focus on tonight and that is the actual reason we're here, to talk about growing the economy and if clean energy can actually get us out of this economic challenging environment that we're in.  So first of all we talked about our view of what defines clean energy, it's about more efficient, cleaner energy in terms of less emissions, it's about not just talking about wind and solar here, but innovations that go beyond wind and solar.  It's about cleaner fossil fuels.  It's about innovations we haven't seen yet. It's about energy storage and all the ancillary investments and innovations that need to go on to building and creating a new energy economy.  And then, going back to the cost issue, I think we've made some very big points tonight, about how the costs are coming down the curve.  And we need to be spending our time, and money, and efforts right now building an innovation economy.  Because not only do we need to do that domestically, but we need to, we need an investment strategy for how we're going to be building our export economy.\", \"The jobs are all over the place.  They're everywhere, from investment houses, research firms, there are engineering jobs.  So, I used to work at Bechtel and BP, you know what Bechtel and BP's biggest problem is? It's about getting young people into that business, into their businesses.  Because people don't want to be drilling engineers.  They want to be solar entrepreneurs and energy engineers.  So--\", 'Okay, so, Ill answer in two parts.  Number one, the spike issue -- I think that were vulnerable to price spikes in any environment over the next five to seven years. Currently were experiencing a price spike.  We could see that again in two years.  We could see that in five years.  We could see that in another month.  I think that one other point I would make, and this is based on my experience at BP, which is that, were not going to see oil at $10 or $20 a barrel anymore.  And part of that is because the above- ground and below-ground risks have changed for the oil industry.  So, number one, we have to drill further and in more difficult places to get the oil out of the ground.  Clearly, weve seen that in the Gulf of Mexico incident.  And then, secondly, the above-ground risks.  So most of the oil in the future is going to be developed in non-OECD countries, and were already seeing that happen.  So what does that mean? It means that the natural oil companies have more control over their resources and that it is certainly raising the cost of getting a barrel of oil out of the ground for the IOCs, for the independent oil companies.', \"I think we see them as all of the above.  I certainly would say that when I think about where I want to be putting my dollars to work I think about, Where are my export markets?  Where are my customers?  I mentioned a statistic earlier tonight that 90 percent of the real energy growth thats going to be happening over the next two decades is in non-OECD countries -- developing countries. So we have to be partnering, we have to be developing our customer base; we have to be developing the appropriate trade policies.  You know, one of the points that was made earlier tonight was that Apple was viewed as a great company, and Apple has innovated here in the United States, the value is created, the IP is here, some of the manufacturing's abroad.  Were going to have to have some, not all, certainly for the large cap-ex projects where it makes sense to have local industry develop those products like wind, that needs to be domestic, but for certainly for a lot of other products we will need to partner with place -- with countries like China.\", 'Yeah.', \"I'm going to make a quick point on this, because I think it's a very important one.  And you're right, we did not really address it tonight.  I work with utilities quite a bit, and those that are very exposed with their coal fleets-- --they are very concerned, and very interested in figuring out energy, again, the future of energy innovation, and how they can strategize the future portfolio for the next five, 10, 20 years.  And yes, natural gas is definitely going to be part of that solution.  But guess what, we've had experiences where we've had a big build-up in natural gas power generation, I experienced it in California when I was working for Bechtel, we were building and investing in natural gas power plants, one a week, almost.  And guess what, the net price of natural gas spiked 10, $13 a kilowatt hour.  So, guess what.  We need to be thinking a bit broadly about how we're going to be developing our future generation plate, because you're absolutely right.  We've got a big challenge ahead of us, and we need to be thinking very broadly about a big portfolio --\", 'Well, the one thing, and I was just going to make one point here which is I actually agree with our opponents here.  I do think nuclear and natural gas are part of the solution. What we havent spoken about tonight is actually the importance of having efficient, appropriate long-term transparent government policies to get us there.  So if we are going to have an economic recovery thats going to be fueled by clean energy, weve got to have the appropriate government policies in place to get us there in the most efficient and the cheapest manner.', 'Actually, Ive got a point here Id like to make.', 'And this is a very important question.  I think that what we havent seen enough of in this country is enough policies that actually pool technologies into the marketplace.  Weve seen a lot push.  Well you need some of the push because you actually need to be developing the end market so that you have the development of the turbines and the solar panels who actually sell into a big market, but I absolutely think that the pool of technologies is the most important thing that we need to be focusing on.  That could be through a carbon price, a tax or just some sort of price on carbon. I think the clean energy standard, and certainly a federal one is certainly a good way to go rather than the patchwork of state policies that make investors, I think, very concerned because we dont -- wed like to see a big federal approach so that we have an easier time in putting our money to work.', 'Tana.', \"Well Id like to summarize tonight by saying first of all our opposing side has done us a great benefit tonight. Theyve said that theyre bullish on solar, that natural gas is clean, that Apple is a great example of a company that has innovated here but manufactures their products abroad in China.  And all of those points help us because essentially theyre saying that they agree with us, that the clean energy economy will help to grow our economy and get us into a state of recovery.  Id also like to bring it back to why Im here tonight.  Im not an environmentalist; I dont like bats and birds.  I like making money and I wouldnt be here talking about the importance of clean energy if I didnt think that there was an opportunity for investors and consumers to improve our state by either making money or reducing our costs of consuming energy.  Weve talked about subsidies; we've talked about how subsidies in the United States help dirty and clean energy. We've been in agreement that we're seeing costs come down the cost curve for many clean energy technologies, whether it be batteries for electric vehicles, or solar energy. And we've also agreed here that, you know, oil price spikes aren't great.  And therefore, we need to be expanding our energy options into a variety of different fuels, clean and dirty, and make them cleaner. So, I would just finalize here, my points, by saying, I think that we need to be focusing on what's actually going to be getting us into this next stage of growing our economy.  And we're already doing that.  We're already seeing energy technology move to a place where, we saw IT and Biotech 10, 20, 30 years ago.  And it's about focusing on the technology, focusing on the smart policies that actually promote energy innovation, and promote pooling technologies and having them compete with one another. And finally, it's about policies that actually bring finance into the, into this industry.  And leverage --\", 'Thank you.']\n",

      "['Wisdom.', 'Arianna, I can\\'t explain. So the defender of the two-party system starts out by conceding that parties are cowardly, ineffectual and stupid and so stands by the proposition that we can\\'t do any better, which is good counter programming toward Obama standing on a position of hopelessness and changelessness, more or less standing up for the \"Let\\'s go suck on a gas pipe\" party. And I suggest you support P.J. if you have Jack Kevorkian on your speed dial, that we can\\'t do any better.  But then in the middle of his remarks, a sort of miracle occurs, and after telling us how stupid the parties are, suddenly he decides they are about to reconstitute themselves into something not half bad.  P.J. and I are old friends, and I know he took a lot of drugs in the \\'60s. [laughter] Call Rockefeller University.  Apparently, they\\'re still hanging around. Now, Arianna spoke about the broad dysfunction of our parties.  I\\'m going to speak about the narrow dysfunction, especially in Washington where I cover it.  I cover politicians very closely. And I can tell you, from this context, politicians are all emotional freaks of one sort or another. They have what I call logorrhea dementia, which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane. But they do have these intense social antennae so they, if you meet them, they will guarantee to invade your personal space.  They\\'ll stand too close, rub the back of your head. I was campaigning with Mitt Romney up in New Hampshire once, and he was campaigning in a diner with his five perfect sons, Bip, Chip, Rip, Lip, Sip and Dip.  And we go in the diner.  He introduces himself to a family and then says, What village in New Hampshire are you from? And then he describes the home he owned in their village.  And then he goes around the diner and then first-names everybody on the way out. So they\\'re weird social creatures.  Nonetheless, I would say in general, they are better people than one would anticipate.  Most of them are in it for the right reason, but they\\'re stuck in a rotten system.  They\\'re stuck in our current two-party system which forces them to behave in ways that are worse than they are.  It\\'s a mind suck. First of all, they cannot be entrepreneurial. They cannot think for themselves because they have to hew the party line. They get -- every Tuesday.  They go to a lunch.  They get the message of the week.  They have to parrot the message of the week.  It\\'s a soul suck.  They can\\'t behave nicely or even get to know the people in the other party because there are unofficial barriers. I went to something called the Civility Conference where Annenberg took House members from both parties to the Green Briar Hotel and got them to work together, or to meet together.  And I went to the dining room.  It was like junior high, all the Republicans over here, all the Democrats over here.  They know nothing about each other.  When a member of a party starts describing to me the -- what\\'s going to happen on the other side, I know everything they\\'re about to tell me is wrong because they know nothing about each other. Finally, it\\'s freedom destroying.  They come in wanting to cut deals, talking in private about what they\\'d like to achieve.  But they\\'re in a tribal mentality in what -- what they can achieve is severely limited by the tribal sort of Tutsi versus Hutu nature of our politics of the current two-party system. So as a result, they find themselves unable to lead the lives they\\'d like to lead. Arianna talked about how the big problems are therefore not addressed because they are stuck in these little trenches.  These problems come up every day, the squeezing of the middle class unaddressed.  I would talk about today\\'s story, the issue of the budget.  We are facing a fiscal meltdown in this country.  And if you took individuals outside the party context that we have now, I bet we could all cut a deal.  We could figure out what taxes needed to go up and what spending needs to go down.  But we\\'re stuck in this dysfunctional marriage where, first of all, 85 percent of the budget is completely off the table because neither party wants to touch it. Secondly, you\\'ve got the Republicans who at least have big ideas for cutting the spending.  But they have no idea what spending should be cut and what isn\\'t, so they\\'re cutting some of our most valuable programs like Head Start and early childhood education because that\\'s the party dogma. Then on the Democrat side, they\\'ve got some decent ideas to save Head Start and early childhood education. But the present -- the Democrats have no persuasive ideas so we can actually cut the budget deficit and avoid national bankruptcy by 2015 or 2019.  In 2019, we will be paying interest on the debt equal to about 800, $900 billion.  And this problem has been building and building and building.  We are completely unable to solve it because the Republicans refuse to raise taxes, which is going to have to happen, the Democrats refuse to talk about Medicare and Social Security reductions, which are going to have to happen. We are stuck and we are heading toward a national disaster. So the first thing we need to do is get out of the system where were stuck in these party ruts.  The University of Maryland had a very interesting study where they took Tea Party people, they took liberals, and they said, Heres our budget problem, you deal with it. And the Tea Party people acknowledged that they had to raise taxes, the people on the far left acknowledged some spending had to be cut. They all could do it.  But the two-party system cant do it.  The second thing we have to do is mobilize independence.  We probably need a third party, but we certainly need a de- alignment, we need more movements to come in and affect the parties so people are less hewn to these tribal parties and thats what the parties have become, theyve become tribes, almost ethnic tribes.  They are no longer the normal political groupings that they were 20 or 30 years ago.  Theyve become tribes where your honor is attached to your tribe and any compromise seems like a sign of shame and dishonor and therefore theyre not willing to do it. So we need to get more movements involved, take up the two parties. And then finally we need a philosophy, weve got two parties in this country, but weve got three movements.  The first movement is a liberal movement that believes in using government to enhance equality.  The second movement is a conservative movement that believes in limited government to enhance freedom. But starting at the foundation of our Republic there was a movement starting with Alexander Hamilton going up to Abraham Lincoln going up to Teddy Roosevelt which believed in limited but energetic government to enhance social mobility, to give people the tools to compete.  This is not big government, its not little government, its energetic government to give people the tools to thrive in a capitalist economy.  That centrist movement is completely unrepresented by the two parties and yet its where the largest percentage of Americans are.  So if you think, if you take a look at the fiscal situation, if you take a look at some of these big issues and you can see our current two-party system leading to a solution in the near term, you can vote for those guys, but if you cant see a plausible way out of our problems I suggest you vote for us, thank you. [applause]', \"Because it wasn't always thus.  If you go back to, say, 30 years ago, and you look at the two parties.  In the first place, the two parties overlapped in Congress.  Now they do not. There's no common ground between them.  In the second place, if you look at the things they were able to do, like tax reform in 1986, you had a whole series of bipartisan agreements. If you cover Congress the way I do, you had, in those days, a whole series of personal relationships.  That simply doesn't exist.  And that's what -- [talking simultaneously]\", \"No.  There was a period of constructive competition.  They fought.  Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton.  I would write that as highly polarizing. [laughter] But they fought to balance each other's weaknesses.  And now they don't -- they don't -- they fight to stagnate.\", 'I thought that was Michael Dukakis. [laughter]', 'First, on the civility point, screw off, you fat bastard. [laughter] Lets go, lets go!  No, I believe in conflict, Im a columnist, conflict is fine with me. And Im fine with that as long as its constructive.  The problem is we have parties that dont represent the country.  We now have, heres a fact from Morris Fiorina, Stanford political scientist, more people own ferrets than watch Fox News. [laughter] And so, but we have a party --', \"That's a good point, yeah. [applause] Glenn Becks ferret is loose.  But we have a party thats sort of dictated by that small group, and in the Democratic party we have a party dictated by the public sector employee unions. And youve got vast numbers of people whose views are not basically represented, so the country is still a bell curve country, and the rest of the -- and the two-party system is not. And therefore you dont have --\", 'A bell curve is like this, most people in the middle.  And so you dont have constructive competition, which would be us talking and then reaching an agreement after an hour, you just have, eh, you guys suck.', 'Compare pre-nomination John McCain to post-nomination John McCain and see what a guy has to do to get elected. [applause]', 'Speaking of this long duration, you know, I grew up here at NYU.  I went to the University of Chicago, a Baptist school where atheist professors teach Jewish students Saint Thomas Aquinas. [laughter] Im used to long historical visions, and the idea that Oh, its sort of always been like this, its just not true.  Lets take my pet issue, the deficit.  Every generation has an incentive to pass debt off on the future generations, but no generation until the current one has done it because the political system --', '-- was able to mobilize and basically exercise some self control and cut deals.  Ronald Reagan did the biggest tax increase in American history because the political system then basically worked. The parties are now different than they were then.', \"First, I'm not necessarily for realignment, but de-alignment.  We're seeing all sorts of social movements that are growing up organically like the Tea party, like the Obama movement, like Move On.  I'd like to see a lot more of those movements in order to loosen up the parties.  And the second thing, I do think there has been an historical tradition, which I talked about, from Hamilton to Lincoln and maybe to moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats today, the very few that exist.  That tradition is unrepresented by our politics.  And I think that long American historic tradition deserves a voice.  So those would be two things I'd change.\", \"Fighting is the norm.  Polarization like we've seen is not the norm.  This is actually statistically demonstrable.  Political scientists take a look at how many votes cross party lines, how many times in each Congress people actually reach bipartisan deals.  And the number now is at all time lows, it's cycled through history, but its never been like this. People fought Lyndon Johnson in the '60s, fought -- but Lyndon Johnson was able to fashion coalitions.  Henry Clay, people then fought, they were able to fashion coalitions. The problem is not that they were fighting.  Im all for fighting, the problem is that each party has become more rigid in my own lifetime of covering this stuff.  When I came to Washington in the early '80s I could go to back benchers like Jack Kemp or Newt Gingrich on the Republican side, they had all these weird ideas they were trying to push on leadership.  That doesnt happen, the leaders control everything now.  The nature of the parties has changed.\", 'Yes.', 'I guess I would say --', \"- I was born in Canada, bula bula. [laughter] You know, I'm actually not sure that's it because members of Congress fly home every weekend.  That's one of the reasons their lives are so miserable and they hold town meetings. And a lot of places -- I meant the flight, not the getting there -- they hold town meetings and if they can get 30 or 50 people to show up they're happy, they love to meet people, they spend a lot of time meeting people.  And as I said they have this you and I need food and water, they just need social love, that's what they need.  And so I don't think that's it. I don't think it's when they go home that the problem is, I think it's when they come to Washington and are surrounded by a psychological vortex.  I just wanted to make that explicit.  I think the psychology within the parties has changed --\", '[unintelligible]', '-- just another role is non-party primaries.  I mean, if you look at the most disaffected people, theyre not actually where Nader is or not where Libertarians are.  Theyre in the middle 37 percent of the country basically feels disaffected.  But they have no candidates to vote for in general elections because theyre just not offered them.  And if you had non-party primaries, youd have a better shot theyd have a voice.', \"Well, I mean, let's take this case right here.\", \"We've got a 5-foot 6-inch Jewish guy who runs this city, Mayor Bloomberg.  He thought about running --\", \"I'm amazed he's 5-foot-6.  So he thought about running for president.  And he had some money, I hear. And so he thought, well, you know -- and there were a lot of people who were disaffected.  So could I win?  And then he said, well, I could win some states, probably not all of them, but I could win some.  And then it would get thrown into the House of Representatives, a body staffed entirely by Republicans and Democrats.  There's no way they're going to vote for me.  And so he was dissuaded from running as a third-party candidate by the fact that the two parties have a stranglehold on the presidential process.\", 'One of you guys just said Mayor Bloomberg ran the city well.  I think it was you.', \"Well, you know, I do this for a living.  And I sometimes go on TV shows, and the TV shows I happen to go on are some of the best on TV, the News Hour with Jim Lehrer, which is much less partisan shouting than most.

And I consider myself Hamiltonian, like I've been saying, which fits very awkwardly with the current Republican party.  And yet that's my seat.  That's my role.  That's what I play on TV. And so it's sometimes frustrating.  I can imagine for people further outside one of those parties, it's frustrating because you're put into that slot. And I've been very struck by -- I think when I started doing this, people would say, Are you conservative or liberal?  Now people come up to me, Are you a Republican or Democrat?

I have three credit cards, one of which I can use at any time.  Throughout this entire debate, shes been texting Matt Damon and Fergie.  Ive seen The Bourne Identity. Arianna and I agree on most things.  In fact, I think I can safely say I agree with Zev and P.J. a lot more than I agree with Arianna.  And yet if Arianna and I sat in a room and talked about the big issues facing our country, I bet we could reach some plausible solutions.  But if we were elected to the two parties as they currently exist, we would never get in the same room because those two parties have gotten much more rigid. So when I take a look at the issues that are before us, and those issues have been alighted I think during this debate:  Immigration, a vital issue about which the two parties can reach no agreement; debt, a vital issue about which the two parties can reach no agreement. Wage stagnation and inequality, a long-growing issue about which the two parties can reach no agreements; campaign finance.  I could go on.  These are all concrete issues that are right here in front of us.  If you see a way for our current two-party system -- if you see an avenue for them to reach agreement and solutions on these issues, even in perfect solutions, well, then vote for the guys in the red ties.  But if you don't, vote for the glamorous side.  Thank you. [applause]\"]\n",
      "['Yes, I am fast moving toward one party rule.', \"Thank you so much.  David and I are here to convince you that indeed the two-party system has rendered this country ungovernable.  And the evidence is all around us. Wherever you look you see that we can only produce suboptimal solutions to our deepest crisis. And if you have any doubt about that just look around.  Why do we still have banks that we have deemed to be too big to fail?  Why did our two-party system produce three major disasters in recent years?  The financial meltdown, the mining disaster that left 29 miners dead in West Virginia, the BP oil spill, just to mention three major disasters, that were produced as a result of our completely dysfunctional two-party system.  And, you know, for many, many years weve kind of postponed solving our big problems, weve postponed dealing with our deficit, we've postponed dealing with the decline of the middleclass, we've postponed dealing with our crumbling infrastructure, we've postponed dealing with our deteriorating education system.  Well, we can no longer keep postponing dealing with these problems.  So while the two-party system might have been okay during the ordinary times, were not living in ordinary times right now. We actually have to solve our problems, we have no more reserves, weve run out of time, the chickens have come home to roost.  And the problem with the two-party system is that is has made us all prisoners of conventional wisdom.  Its made us look at every political problem through that obsolete prism of right versus left.  In fact our political problems are not susceptible to that easy completely reductionist way of looking at them. Lets take Afghanistan, the media consider anybody who wants to leave Afghanistan as a lefty.  In fact George Will, the Cato Institute, Pat Buchanan, Joe Scarborough, and many conservative intellectuals see no reason for us to be pursuing an unwinnable war at huge expense.  Lets look at reforming Wall Street. There are many good capitalists who sleep with a copy of Ayn Rands books under their pillow, who believe that Wall Street desperately needs reforming if its going to actually operate like a capitalist system as opposed to operating like an oligarchy, crony,  system where losses are socialized and gains are privatized.  Nevertheless the two-party system makes that kind of thinking impossible because we continue to see everything through that obsolete binary prism.  But look around, the favorability ratings of the two parties are constantly declining.  We now have Dems at about 39 percent favorability rating and Republicans at 34 percent.  And the last election despite all the attention, despite all the media hoopla only 42 percent of the electorate voted.  This is an enormous amount of dissatisfaction in the political system to have so many people not even participating in that most elementary duty of citizenship voting. And then lets look at what would have happened in any other section of our life if we had such a vacuum.  There would have been more competition; there would have been more participation from others, but not in our political system.  Indeed inordinate amounts of power is folded in the hands of a few so-called centrist senators, like Olympia Snowe, do you remember during the healthcare debate for 14 months Democrats did everything they could to woo Olympia Snowe. They are like lovelorn high schoolers who are just not getting the message that she was just not into them. [laughter] And John Adams predicted what would happen when he said that there is nothing I dread so much as a division of the Republic into two great parties each arranged under its leader and converting measures in opposition to each other. But thats exactly what we have done.  And the hunger for change is overwhelming.  The election of Barack Obama is evidence of that, the rise of the Tea Party is evidence of that. There is huge mistrust of our national institutions, politicians, business people, the media. And the rise of social media, the rise of the Internet has made it possible for young people especially to connect with each other, to reject the existing system, to opt out of politics and try to find solutions in their own communities, bypassing the political system.  Thats not ultimately healthy because democracy is not a spectator sport.  And if were going to revive democracy, if were going to overcome all the obstacles in the way of a truly Democratic system, you know, the way we have the huge advantages of incumbency, the difficulty of ballot access, the gerrymandering of our districts. If were going to overcome all these things, we need to actually bring more competition and more voices and fresh thinking to our political system. Because as Einstein put it, to paraphrase him, the problems we are facing right now cannot be solved at the same level of thinking that created them.  And thats all that the two parties are capable of. So, let me just end by quoting Thomas Jefferson.  In a letter to Francis Hopkinson, he said, I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of man whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in anything else, while I was capable of thinking for myself. Such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent.  If I could not go to Heaven but with a party, I would not go to Heaven at all. [laughter] Well, its here that our two-party system is not taking us to Heaven.  In fact, its rapidly taking us in the other direction.  Thank you.

When women didn't have the vote, you would say, well, you know, it could have been worse. When we didn't have -- when African-Americans could not vote, you would say, well, you know, just think of it.  In other countries, it's just infinitely worse, and the World Bank probably would have given us an A rating.  But -- [applause] Arianna Huffington: That World Bank A rating really worries me.

We believe that we can do better.\", 'Well, we are arguing for something that will shake up the current dysfunctional system.', \"Yeah. Your notes are in Hebrew and mine are in Greek so we all have a problem.  But the truth of the moment is that as an immigrant to this country who has lived the American dream. I'm fully aware of the fact that the American dream is dying for millions of Americans. And I have two daughters in college.  And a growing number of their friends are graduating from college, and they can't get jobs.  We have 26 million Americans at the moment who are either unemployed or underemployed.  And we don't have any plan that the two parties seem to be capable of, of how to bring jobs about.  So there is a huge dysfunctionality.  And the results are really incredibly profound.  I mean, they are changing the nature of this country.  Upward mobility has been at the heart of the American dream.  Now we are number ten when it comes to upward mobility. We are behind France and Germany.  Excuse me, but being behind France in upward mobility is like France being behind us in croissants and afternoon sex. [laughter]\", \"Well, the idea that its dumb kids that are the problem is just charming P.J.  I mean, whatever P.J. says, he's charming because he's funny.  But it's not true.

That's why you have 37 percent of Americans who are registered as independents because they don't believe our current two-party system is delivering what the country needs.  And increasingly young people who really do want to find solutions to our problems are choosing civic engagement instead of political engagement. Who have long waiting lists for people to join teach for America, so it's not as if they've given up on making the world better.  I mean, P.J. and Zev may have given up on making the world better but -- [laughter] -- young people haven't, they just don't see the political route through the two-party system as the way to make the world better, but if we give up on making the world better then we might as well give up on everything.  You know, I mean, I think in the end Churchill was right, he said Americans can be counted to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other possibility. [laughter] And the two-party system is one of the other possibilities we have now exhausted.\", 'Exactly. [laughter]', 'Well, first of all, let me just say that the motion is The two-party system is making American ungovernable.  And I hope youve all heard our opponents make our case again and again and again.  In fact, P.J. just said, its not good right now, but it doesnt mean its not going to get better.  Absolutely.  All we are saying is that we need to take steps to make it better.  We cant just wait by the sidelines and expect it to get better. And the fastest way to make it better is to shake up a dysfunctional and stagnant two- party system.  Thats all we have to prove.', 'Thats all we are arguing.  Well, the primary way is to allow more competition. All of us believe in competition, right?  Its the essence of a private enterprise, freedom- based system.  We believe in competition in everything except politics. When it comes to politics, youve got to pick your party and run with your party, and actually espouse whatever the party stands for at that particular moment.  One election cycle, it may be abortion or no abortion -- the social issues, this election cycle, and its around issues that have to do with the shrinking government on the Republican side.   So, thats not the way to fundamentally change the conditions we are all living under.', 'And I would add that --', '-- movement politics really leads us to what I call Hope 2.0. You know, if Obama was about hope, which is just basically hope being channeled to one of the two parties.  Hope 2.0 is about hope being channeled to multiple movements, a community solution, people all around the country unleashing an enormous amount of creativity and ingenuity around finding solutions at the local level.  We in the media are doing a lousy job of putting a spotlight on what is working.  We need to do a much better job.  We need to help them scale up.  And this is really part of what we are talking about.', 'No, I think --', \"I think to a large extent the parties use movements during election times.  I mean, look at the Obama movement.  Once Obama was in the White House, he basically disappeared. They are now trying to reconstitute it because he is beginning to run for the election. That's not what makes a thriving movement. A movement is something which organically continues to grow through elections and beyond them.  And that's what we need more of.  People do not trust establishments.  I mean, look at the tea party movement.  It's fundamentally anti-establishment.  Look at what's happening among young people on the Democrat side, fundamentally anti- establishment.  The numbers of mistrust when it comes to our national institutions has skyrocketed.  We need to address that. Otherwise we are becoming an increasingly dysfunctional society.\", \"Yeah, I completely agree with you.  And if you look, for example, at the way the media describes our political problems, its reflexively through that prism of right versus left.  I mean, I mentioned Afghanistan in my opening statement, Wall Street reform, unemployment. Why is it left wing to care about helping people get jobs? And yet that's how it's portrayed in the media.  But if you look at how the discussion is, say, on social media, it's very different.  Does not accept those very stale distinctions.  So we have a responsibility, those of us in the media and everybody else, to participate in that and change it. And increasingly, more and more, people are participating, and self- expression has become a kind of form of self-fulfillment.  More people are participating, uploading videos.  We saw it not just here.  We saw it in what happened in Egypt recently.  We saw a phenomenal outpouring of something which I suppose you might regard dangerous because it's leading to uncontrollable passions.  But it's also leading to freedom, liberation and other things that uncontrollable passions provide.\", 'Well, first of all, the fact that you are calling it a mob shows what respect you have for them.  The other thing is that --', 'Why is it a mob?  Why are people who are organizing on Facebook or through Twitter in order to overthrow an oppressive regime a mob?', \"Absolutely, I think thats a very important point and especially with the citizens' united decision. As you said we see the stronghold of money on our political system, the power of special interest, the fact that we have dozens of lobbyists per member of Congress, the fact that even when good legislation is passed its undermined at the committee stage. All those things have made us ungovernable, because even when -- and we have mining reform for example, then you go back and you look at how it was all watered down to the point where the Virginia mining disaster could happen.  Even when you have regulators living inside Lehman Brothers or Fannie and Freddie, they were not able to prevent the regulator recapture that allowed the financial meltdown to happen.  I mean we have lost trillions in private wealth.  We have the greatest increase in poverty in the suburbs at the moment.  We are becoming a third world country and if we dont pay attention now, if we dont do something where they stand to course correct then its going to be too late. And thats why this is the time to sound the alarm, recognize it to have become ungovernable and change the system.\", 'Well, because it depends on the kind of problems we are facing.  And if we are really willing to recognize the problems that we are facing now and how serious they are, when it comes to unemployment, when it comes to foreclosures, when it comes to bankruptcies, when it comes to the fact that growing numbers of kids cant afford college, and if they graduated from college cant get jobs. I mean, these are serious problems.  And they are also leading to a kind of political instability and a kind of demonizing our opponents, which always happens during times of deep economic anxiety, when it was the 1880s when we were expelling Chinese workers, or the 1930s when we were expelling Hispanic workers who were actually American citizens.  You see what the problems are when we are not taking steps to deal with them in a timely manner.', 'Yeah, I would say that even though we dont have to take that question in doing the debate, we are very willing to take that question on. And there are many voting measures that could be put in place if the two-party system did not have a stronghold on the current electoral system that would make it possible, for example.  If you voted for Ralph Nader, and if Ralph Nader did not win, for your vote to go to your second choice.  I mean, that is a completely plausible system that can be implemented immediately if the two parties did not prevent it from being implemented.', 'So, if all you care about here tonight is to make P.J.s life easier, vote against this motion. If you care about making the life of the country better, vote with us.  Basically, the two- party system is like a stale marriage.  Democrats and Republicans need something to spice it up.  They need to go on craigslist and find a third party. [laughter] And if that third party isnt wearing a shirt, they really should do a background check. Because he might turn out to be a member of Congress, and you dont want to go there. So, I remember in 2000 I organized a shadow convention.  The shadow conventions were intended to address issues that the two political parties were not addressing.  And those issues were the growing income inequalities, the failed war on drugs that has put more African Americans in jail than that have jobs at the moment, and also the problem that was addressed here tonight of campaign financial reform and the desperate need to do that.  Since 2000, all these problems have gotten worse, and they have gotten worse because the two-party system has made this country ungovernable.  And unless you give up on the idea of America becoming a more perfect union. Unless you give up on the idea of us being able to really live up to the American dream of our ancestors, then youve got to vote with David and me.']\n",

      "['Not very profitable but I own it.', 'Not exactly right but I have a pre-existing condition.  Actually, I have two kidneys on my left side from some extensive work before the 21st Century and I was left on COBRA coverage and the solution, of course, is to start your own employer so I started a think tank to get insurance. [laughter]', 'I am covered.', \"So thank you very much for the chance to be here tonight to our sponsors and to our opponents.  You know, Im going to ask you to support the motion but in the end, youve all realized that what were debating tonight is about getting healthcare reform in the United States because there is no dispute about the need for healthcare reform. My own history, Johns history, probably the histories on the other side of the table of which Im unaware are stark tribute to the need to do things better in the United States. Real healthcare reform has two pieces.  Number one, it extends healthcare coverage to Americans, gives them options for insurance and insurance is a product which shifts around the cost of your healthcare. In the end, an insurance system takes the nations health care bill and shifts around who picks up the ultimate cost, moving it from some people who are unable to shoulder the full burden of the cost of their care to some others who may be able to.  The second piece, the piece that drives everything, is the overall healthcare bill.  And the United States has a health care bill which is far too large and certainly far too large for what we get.  At one-sixth of our economy, its one of the most inefficient pieces of economics that one could imagine.  And the key fact to remember in thinking about this debate is that over the past four decades.  If you look at income per person in the United States and healthcare spending per person, the resources versus the costs, costs have been winning at two to two and a half percentage points every year for four decades. Republicans, Democrats alike.  It is the costs and the spending on healthcare that ultimately has to be covered by insurance premiums.  And if you don't control costs, you cannot control insurance premiums, and you cannot deal with extending coverage to Americans, which is ultimately what real healthcare reform is about.  I favor repeal because this reform flunks the test of healthcare reform.  It does not deal with the cost problem. Now, I don't need to say so.  Many people, far more qualified than I, have said so.  The Congressional Budget Office, in the aftermath of passage of the Affordable Care Act, put out its new long-term care -- or its new long-term budget projections.  Did health spending in the federal budget grow more slowly as a result of this?  No, it does not. You can look at the CMS actuary, the administration, the Obama administration's own chief actuary, Richard Foster, who estimates that the affordable care actually will raise national healthcare spending, not lower it, and will actually endanger the future of Medicare, not make it more solid. You can ask Jonathan Gruber.  Jonathan Gruber is one of the architects of Obamacare. He's one of the architects of the Massachusetts reform on which Obamacare was founded. And in his article in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, he says, This isn't about cost reform.  This is health insurance reform.  There's nothing in it.  Much like Massachusetts, it's just about covering people.  It doesn't control costs. And you can look at the experience in Massachusetts where, prior to reform, Massachusetts had costs that were 25 percent higher than the national average.  And after reform, they were at 30 percent higher than the national average, no improvement in the fundamental requirement of healthcare reform. So we need to get the healthcare reform.  And without that, we will never control the budgetary costs that threaten our nation. Now, I'm a former CBO director.  It is my obligation to stand up in public and say apocalyptic things about the budgetary future.  I'll spare you the numbers tonight because I like you more than my children.  But the bottom line is this nation, looking forward -- forget re-litigating the past. Mr. Starr is good at that.  But looking forward in the administrations budget 10 years from now, after the financial crisis is in memory, after were soon to be out of Iraq, out of Iran, after the economy is [unintelligible] back at five percent unemployment, we are running a deficit of a trillion dollars.  Nine hundred billion of it's to pay interest on previous borrowing.  We are headed to that magical position where we're borrowing to pay previous borrowing and nothing else. Along the road, we will pass the criteria for downgrade as a sovereign nation.  We will no longer be a top- rated borrower. This act makes that situation worse, not better.  It says that two new open-ended entitlement programs that will grow, according to CBO, at eight percent a year, as far as the eye can see, the economy is not going to grow at eight percent.  Revenue's not going to grow at eight percent. The only way you could make that kind of a move add up budgetarily is smoke, mirrors and gimmicks.  And that's what the Affordable Care Act is riddled with, in which the CBO was forced to acknowledge in its score.  If you give them handcuffs, they'll come up with any answer that you might want. So we can't afford this as a nation.  It is dangerous because it doesn't control costs.  It's not really healthcare reform.  You need to vote for healthcare reform, not Obamacare. One sixth of our economy is underperforming.  If we care about economic performance, we should repeal Obamacare.  Forget the mandates, forget the taxes.  We had a system that was broken to begin with.  One-sixth of our economy is broken.  Why not fix it instead of writing checks and papering over it? But you hear some other arguments from the other side, the popular ones, now, the issues of fairness.  Let us stipulate this is one of the most unfair pieces of legislation ever passed.  There are the inequities between two people similarly situated, making $70,000. One's going to get $7,000 in federal subsidies, 10 percent of their income.  The other's going to get zip.  That is grotesquely unfair.  And if any future Congress acts [unintelligible] pass one, it'll get solved in a nanosecond.  They'll give everybody the money.  And my first problem will blow up even worse.  Terrible idea.  And for every young person in this audience, this is a disaster. Through the individual mandate you'll be obligated to be in the pool.  The purpose is to put you in there to pay the healthcare bills of people who are older and sicker than you.  And at the end of your life, you get to pick up the debt that's been incurred through Obamacare.  You'll get it at the front end.  You'll get it at the back end.  It is one of the most inter-generationally unfair things that has ever been scripted by the United States Congress.  Should be repealed on those grounds alone. There are other sort of detours along the way.  The insurance companies, that's where all the costs come from.  Oh, my God, there are administrative costs.  There are profits.  The top 10 insurance companies in 2009 made $260 billion.  That's a lot of money.  I'd like to have it.  The cost growth problem every year is $175 billion.  So go for it. Nationalize the insurance companies, confiscate their profits.  You get about a year and a half's worth of relief, and we're right back where we were.  This isn't about insurance companies.  This is about fundamental changes to the delivery system so that we coordinate care so that we deliver high quality care at lower costs.  And the greatest missed opportunity here was the chance to fix Medicare, which is at the root of our problems.  Medicare pays doctors.  It pays hospitals.  It pays some insurance companies, and it pays drug companies.  And it has silos to pay them all.  And nowhere in there can you find a beneficiary.  Nowhere in there can you get coordination of care.  Nowhere in there is the kind of healthcare Americans deserve.  We should fix that first.  We should repeal this now.  Thank you. [applause]\", \"I have no idea.  Let me just -- I would never speak for 300 million Americans.  And that's one of the beautiful things about this country.  And I think the -- you know, I agree, obviously, with a lot of what Jon has said.  Go back to the beginning of the evening when we were asked to think about end of life care.  Now, do you really think that Americans want an insurance company making decisions about the end of life care?  No.  They've already seen that model and rejected it --\", \"That you can't do that.  They told us, Ill read that evidence.  I don't think they want the government making those decisions.  I think we know who makes those decisions.  It's the family.  It's -- those are the only people who are ethically well situated to make those tough calls.  And so we must, in the end, invest in families, the authority to make decisions, invest in them, their insurance. Invest in them the information and the ability to make those decisions and center this system around families and Americans, not around these large government entities. What does that mean in practice?  I'm an economist.  I mean, economists are practical people. You follow your nose and incentives.  If I have an insurance policy when I'm 21, and then I develop an odd thing where I have to have my kidneys transplanted, I'm still on that insurance policy.  Any insurance company now has to recognize they've got me for life.  It's not a one-year sign-up proposition where they can minimize on preventive care or they can try to cut off covering some things.  They have to deal with the right lifetime incentives.  Pay for the cheap prevention up front.  A lot of them eventually want to do that.  And align the insurance and the medical incentives to transform the way we deliver medicine in America.  That's what we need.  And in the process, guess what?  My insurance goes with me from job to job, job to home when I stayed home with my kids. You don't have to spend the whole time fighting over who works full time to get the insurance.  It's madness.  Americans are rearranging their lives for the insurance. Let's rearrange the insurance so it fits American lives.  That's what this system will be.

Pilots have a terrible track record of actually turning into real policy.  In fact the road to healthcare hell is paved with pilots and demonstrations.  And that's a pilot and a demonstration for a known problem.  If you've got a problem, fix it.  The problem with this bill, it doesn't fix what we know is the issue, healthcare costs.  Instead, it's got a bunch of pilots that Congress will never actually implement.

The important thing here is to have reforms which Republicans include as well as the -- your arguments, to better inform patients so they can distinguish between valuable and invaluable treatments.

An important thing to recognize, the reason I'm deeply opposed to this bill is, it is fundamentally -- there are pages attached to all the issues.  But it is fundamentally a coverage bill.  And if you look at half the expansions, they are in Medicaid.  Sixteen million Americans we've put into Medicaid.  Medicaid's a terrible system. Fifty percent of providers will not see Medicaid patients. Medicaid patients are twice as likely to show up at the ER for regular medical care than are the uninsured.

So there are no real changes in the business model that would allow a physician to practice more cheaply in Medicare, and that is why we should have fixed the problem instead of written the checks that is this system.

This is what I would say to you. Healthcare is not a one thing.  Its not just the circumstances tragic and threatening as you described.  Healthcare and where we spend this is an enormous range that involves elective procedures, it involves chronic conditions, it involves traumatic injury and we have a system that does not provide individuals with anything like the ability to manage their care, anything like information needed to choose from high and low value care and never gets them in a preventive way in a position to avoid being stuck with a tragic choice. Thats wrong.  We need a system that they control all aspects of their life cycle up to those very moments.  And I have a great faith in the ability of the American people. They do it in every other aspect of their lives some of which are enormous, they have kids.  Thats a pretty life and death situation.', 'I have great faith in the ability to do it.', \"There's nothing about insurance companies, per se, that anyone should like.

The second thing is, remember, for those advocates of a single big national payer, a national payer cannot negotiate any better between one hospital in Wichita and another hospital in Wichita which is ultimately where you have to negotiate who can provide this care at the cheapest price. They can't do it any better than the guy in Wichita.  So there is literally no advantage to a national plan.  It's a charade.\", 'I thank you for listening tonight and this is ultimately a debate about our future and I dont think anyone should question the aspirations or good will of either side of this stage in terms of what one would like in affordable coverage for every American and access to high quality care.

What is at issue is what is the best way to go forward and to try to build on this foundation, one that is riddled with financial cancer and one that has only window dressing at attempting to deal with the real problems of the American healthcare system is a dangerous place to begin and it should be repealed in favor of a real future of the American healthcare system.  Now, weve heard that somehow the Republicans got all their ideas and I believe that the vigorous debate tonight would stipulate thats not the case.  This is not something on which we can build a future. This is a dangerous beginning. It does not fix the broken programs that are threatening the financial future of the United States. Medicare and Medicaid are not touched by this program.  They are important pieces of the social welfare system in the United States.  They deserved the attention of the healthcare reform.  They were dismissed as unimportant.  Instead we got a strategy to double down on those broken failures and try to write checks to paper over a broken system and in the process we are threatening the very future of this country, threatening the freedom and prosperity of Americans on which the healthcare system and everything else will be built.  And we are most tragically doing it at the expense of our youngest and most vulnerable, our kids.  They didnt get a vote.  They arent going to be able to believe what we have done to them when they grow up. They will pay the bills now.  They will pay the bills later.  They wont see higher quality care. Theyll see more expensive care.

Repeal Obamacare today. [applause]']\n",
      "[\"That's true.\", 'No.  I think that it is a -- it is a part of the dialogue that you try to get attention.  And that was an attempt to gather some attention.', \"Thank you very much, John.  And thank you to the audience.  You play a key role here tonight.  I want to thank Intelligence Squared for sponsoring this debate.  And I want to recognize my opponents, one of whom has written more than anybody else in the world on this topic.  And most of all, I want to thank my debate partner, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former CBO director and a senior policy advisor to Senator John McCain.  My partner, Douglas Holtz-Eakin is a numbers guy, and he will focus on the numbers.  And I believe he will be able to clearly show you that Obamacare both won't work and perhaps more importantly, will put a critical strain on our nation's fiscal stability.  Let me begin, however, by refuting two arguments.  First, supporters of Obamacare will say that Republicans simply don't believe in healthcare and indeed that they favor the status quo. That is simply wrong.  I believe in my tenure in Congress I had written more healthcare reform bills than any other member of Congress.  I wrote a number of patients rights bills in the early debate. But I was also joined throughout this with the help of Paul Ryan and Tom Coburn and Jim DeMint and Richard Burr and Dr. Tom Price and Dr. Burgess and on and on.  And you would find countless proposals by Republicans to reform our nation's healthcare. Second, supporters of Obamacare will tell you that it will actually save the government money. And they will tell you that repealing it will cost the government money.  Now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin will demonstrate with the numbers that those claims are unfounded. But I urge you to begin by just looking at this question with common sense.  Obamacare insures roughly 32 million additional Americans, most through Medicaid.  That will increase costs.  It creates a massive new bureaucracy, some 150 plus agencies and bureaus.  That's got to increase costs. And it extends dramatic new mandates over health insurance in America.  And that will increase costs. Now, let me move on to one point that I think is very important to understand. The current system is in fact broken.  As I said, I have written numerous bills to try to fix it.  Costs are way too high, and they're going up too quickly.  There are too many uninsured and too many Americans have pre-existing conditions and cannot get affordable coverage.  I have a pre-existing condition, and I have an older sister who has -- who is a breast cancer survivor, probably the worst kind of pre-existing condition. One aspect of the current system is in fact indefensible.  It's the provision that says your employee-provided care is tax free.  It costs them no taxes and you no taxes.  But it punishes those without employee-provided care.  Indeed, it tells them, we want you to get insurance so much we're going to force you to pay for it with after-tax dollars, making it a third more expensive.  That is simply outrageous and indefensible.  And stunningly, Obamacare does not fix that problem. Obamacare is simply the wrong answer.  First, it addresses symptoms, namely the uninsured, which are too high. But it does not address, I do not believe appropriately, certainly not with incentives, cost. Second, it will not only increase the cost to the government, but it will drive up your premiums. And the experts agree on that point.  It moves -- and perhaps this is most important--healthcare decision making away from employers and the insurance companies they hire, and they're making lousy decisions, and they shouldn't be deciding. But it doesn't give those decisions to you and me.  It gives them to the government. What we need to do is take decision making away from employers and insurance companies and give it to people.  Give it to patients, individuals and their families, and let them consult with their doctor and make those decisions.  Republican proposals in Congress do exactly that. Why?  Because if the health insurance is yours, not your employer's and not the government's, it's personal, and it belongs to you.  You can make the changes. You aren't trapped in a plan your employer picked.  You can force the insurance companies to compete, which they don't do now.  You can hire the plan of your choice. And because it's yours, you can fire it, meaning you can hold it accountable to you. Briefly, let me touch on why Obamacare will drive costs up.  By its terms, Obamacare institutes lots of mandates.  One is guaranteed issue, meaning nobody can be turned down.  That will increase cost.  One is modified community rating.  That will increase costs.  And a third is an array of new benefit mandates.  All of those will increase costs. Indeed, in every state, with guaranteed issue and community rating, and in every state where they mandated more and more benefits, costs have gone up dramatically.  In Massachusetts, after adopting a plan very similar to Obamacare, costs have continued to go up at a rate faster than the national average. Let me touch on some of Obamacare's broken promises. The president told us over and over, and quite frankly, over again, that if you like your plan, you can keep it.  Not true.  He said if you like your doctor, you can keep it.  You can keep him or her. Not true.  And he said that Obamacare would send the cost curve down.  None of those promises, as we examine the plan, turn out to be true.  The Medicare actuary has already estimated that some 14 million people will lose their current coverage.  Leading experts say few plans will actually survive.  How could they survive?  They have to meet benefit mandates that haven't even yet been written. In fact, thousands of Americans will lose their employer-provided healthcare because their small employer or large employer cannot afford to continue to offer it.  They will lose their healthcare. AT&T, a study was done and provided to the commerce committee that showed AT&T will save $2 billion, $2 billion if they cancel their employees' care and pay the fine. John Deere will lose $150 million a year.  Caterpillar, $100 million a year.  3M, $90 million a year.  The numbers go on and on.  Those employers will have no choice to their stockholders but to drop that care.  They'll be forced.  And think about their workers. Their workers will lose their current plan, and they'll lose their doctor.  We simply have to do better than that. The new, indeed, one provision of the law is outrageously unfair, as unfair as the tax code is now.  It provides, in the new healthcare exchanges, that if you are uninsured, or if you buy in the individual market, you can enjoin the exchange.  And if you join the exchange, you can get a government subsidy.  But if you have employer-provided care, you cannot join the exchange. That simply isn't fair because it means the cost of your care is subsidized, some with the exact same income cannot get subsidized care.\", 'Thank you very much. [applause]', 'Im thrilled to have that question because I think its vitally important.  I think were already -- were a nation that does support taking care of those who cant care for themselves.  Were a nation -- and my legislation covers every single American -- were a nation that thinks its outrageous that anybody would lose coverage because there are pre-existing condition like my heart condition or my sisters breast cancer.  But were also a nation that honors limited government and honors individual choice.  I think on the one hand what you hear from the other side is that the government can manage this issue better.  And what I would suggest to you is we are in this problem because the government made changes that took you and I out of the equation.  The government said health insurance is available only if your employer buys it and you get a tax deduction. But if you go out and buy it, its one-third more expensive.  If you cant hire and fire somebodys who delivering a service to you, you cant hold it accountable including its costs.', 'Absolutely.  The individual freedom is tied back to the cost of the service and because we cant control it, you are controlling its cost.', 'All the Republicans are arguing is that you ought to give that choice to people. I do not favor individual purchase.  That was the attack made against Senator McCain throughout the campaign and it was absolutely unfair.  I favor a plan which says I as an individual can buy an individual plan, I can take my employers plan or I can buy from a whole group of expanded choices.  We could have my social club.  The Kiwanis Club can offer a plan. My university alumni can offer a plan.  Give me that choice, force those insurance companies to compete.  They dont compete right now.  They dont care what you and I pay for health insurance and they dont, quite frankly, care whether it treats us well.  They only care that our employer bought the plan.', 'Youve got to shop across state lines.', 'I have to raise an issue which your side has raised, and that is you say it gives people choices. It takes a lot of gall to say that it gives people choices.  For example, in Medicare Advantage, it repeals Medicare Advantage for millions of Americans and takes them off.', \"No, no.  It takes -- it will drive people off of Medicare Advantage.  Every expert agrees on that. Two, you say that people will have choice of plans.  There is one plan prescribed by the government, actually has three different components, but that's it.  Three.  Secretary Sebelius can grant exemptions.  She already has too many companies.  She has the ability to impose new benefit mandates.  She has ability to say what premium increase is effective or not effective.  The notion that this bill gives the average American more choice is ridiculous.  It's going to take away the choices Americans have now, and it's going to force them into essentially a one-size-fits-all plan.  When you say, for example, to employers, that your costs are going to up, such as AT&T, to the tune where you could pay the fine for not insuring every one of your employees and still save $2 billion, they're going to have no choice but to drop their coverage and put people into the government- run plan.\", 'Let me finish.  Let me finish.', \"No, he can go.  That's fine.\", 'I mean --', \"Precisely because right now they choose to provide that coverage for their employees because that competitive market requires them to do that.  People want good coverage.  If they drop that coverage, there's no place for those employees to go.  Under this bill, they will all get government subsidies.  And oh, by the way, AT&T can take that $2 billion savings and add it to people's salaries.  So the notion that this is going to give you more choice, when, for example, we don't allow interstate competition in health insurance now. Your employer makes the choice of your plan. You can't hire --\", \"You can't fire.\", \"Actually, number one, in Massachusetts, we're down to, I think, to only four carriers. Several of them are in dire straits.  Many of them have demanded from the governor that he allow them to raise rates.  The governor has said no.  And some of them -- [talking simultaneously] John Shadegg: -- are on the verge of folding.  Now, let me ask you something.  The plan, under Obamacare, says that if you're in an exchange, a government-run exchange, and you only offer the policy that the government exchange allows, then you can get a subsidy.  Every Republican plan says let's give every single American a tax refund, a tax credit to go buy the plan of their choice. Now, I guarantee you, if we do that, so we say to every American, you get a refundable tax credit, a refund, and for the poor, it's cash, to go buy the plan of your choice.  And you can buy your employer's plan.  You can buy in the individual market.  You can join a new group sponsored by the Kiwanis club.  You can join a new group sponsored by -- [talking simultaneously]\", 'No, I would not mandate it because I think freedom is a hallmark of this country.

It offers every single American, every single American that refundable tax credit if they don\\'t make enough money if they do not enroll because they are homeless and don\\'t get the notice we automatically enroll them because we know their Social Security number and we knew it as one point, they show up for care somewhere, and they say, \"What plan did you enroll in?\"  And the individual says -- she\\'s a mother of three that was moving from Idaho to Arizona on the day that the notice came to her, she says, \"I didn\\'t enroll.\" They look her up on a Social Security number and they say, \"Oh, yeah, you\\'re in the pool.\"', '\"And you\\'re covered.\"  That\\'s the way Paul Ryan\\'s bill works, that\\'s the way Tom Coburn\\'s -- [talking simultaneously]', 'This criticism is often made, and the Democrat answer, the Obamacare answer is to say, Okay, were going to do guaranteed issue, everybody gets insurance even if you\\'re already sick.\"  The incentive of that is not to buy insurance until its too late or until the costs have gone up.  Id like to ask Paul, How is it the insurance companies know whos going to get sick before the people know, and how is it that they can cherry pick the healthy?  But let me tell you how Republicans solve this problem. Male Speaker: [unintelligible] John Shadegg: Let me tell you how Republicans would solve this problem, I know because I happen to have written it, what you do is you say to everyone that has a preexisting condition or has a chronic illness, \"You have the right, the absolute right to join whats called a high risk pool.  You may enroll in that plan if you are either denied coverage altogether or if your coverage is priced at, well say, 20 percent, or 30 percent, or more above the average cost, because you have a preexisting condition.  Once you enroll in the high risk pool, your health is covered comprehensively including my sister\\'s breast cancer or my heart condition, and the -- so that means that the cost of insuring that pool is higher than the cost of insuring any other pool. Thats a high risk pool.  The costs of insuring that group are then subsidized either by dividing it equally, the extra costs amongst every insurance company in the jurisdiction, it could be the state or it could be federal, or by general revenues from the state, often done by sin taxes. I happen to know that because its already the law in 22 different states.', 'I happen to know it because I wrote the last federal law that allows it.', 'I do.', \"In a New Republic article that came out some time ago, I'm sorry, the New York Times -- New York --\", '-- article. [talking simultaneously] John Shadegg: New Yorker magazine was the article.  It documented --', \"In a recent authoritative article which appeared in the New Yorker, they studied where healthcare costs are the highest.  And interestingly, they found that the highest place for healthcare costs in America is a little town called McAllen, Texas.  And they went to McAllen, Texas, and tried to find out why are costs so high.  And what they found was a couple of different factors. Number one, they found that doctors in fact do prescribe lots of procedures that are unnecessary.  And they do so in McAllen, Texas.  They noted that, for example, great healthcare centers do not prescribe that many procedures.  And so they figured out there needed to be a way.  They actually began interviewing doctors.  And they said, you know what?  In the current system, we are not incentivized to control costs.  Why are they not incentivized to control costs?  Because nobody's watching the store.  The reality is --\", \"As Paul said, if the consumer isn't paying the bill, then nobody's watching.\", \"And in this circumstance, yeah, if you're sick, you're not making the decision.  But right now, your family could be making that decision.  But right now under the current system and under Obamacare, you will not be making that cost decision because you're cut out of the process.\", 'I love to do that.', 'He did.', 'I dont think government can change personal behavior, but I think law can change personal behavior because right now this system does not incentivize you or I to take care of ourselves.

[talking simultaneously] [laughter] John Shadegg: I take the human side of this argument very, very seriously.  When we were kids growing up, our parents bought indemnity plans, and the doctors cared about us because there was a physician-patient relationship.  We put the cash on their table.  The system we have created now divorces us completely from our doctor.  It says your doctor isnt hired by you, your doctor is hired by a plan who was hired by your employer. And that is what has caused medicine to -- caused damage to the physician-patient relationship, its caused a loss of control in costs, and it has caused the kind of devastation that youre talking about.  I know people that cant afford care because the insurance companies dont give a damn about what it cares.  Its time to stop shoveling money to them and put the power and control in your hands, not to give it to the government so Secretary Sebelius could write a thousand new regulations.  Thats not going to make it more personal, and then the plan I propose covers every single American, every one.', 'Yeah.  The decision point that you referred to, once theyve gotten sick, is not the right one.  The reality is people are economic beings and they do make economic decisions. Indeed, I proposed a bill in the United States Congress that would allow you if you live in New Jersey to buy a plan that was written and offered for sale in Arizona or Idaho or Illinois or Connecticut.  No, no.  Let me explain how it works.  You could buy that policy -- and the reason I wrote that bill is because the people in New Jersey today pay at least four times more than the people in Pennsylvania because of those strictures [spelled phonetically] of the law in New Jersey. Indeed, Americans who go to New Jersey are going to their friends that live in Pennsylvania and say, What are you paying?  And theyre saying Well, Im paying one-fourth of what youre paying.  And people are actually buying health insurance by pretending they live in Pennsylvania when they really live in New Jersey because it costs one-fourth as much. Now we heard the argument that nobody would shop but people really do shop.  But heres why shopping -- ah -- if they can shop -- what makes me maddest about all of this- - [talking simultaneously] Female Speaker: [inaudible]', \"The ability, for example, to buy across lines.  People are not going to pay, are not going to choose to pay cheaper premiums unless they have to.  What theyre going to do is pay, theyre going to spend as much as they can on healthcare and get the best product they can.  They wont choose to buy a cheap policy, some may, but most people buy the most expensive policy they can.  In fact, that was a study done on my bill allowing across state line health insurance sales and indeed, no less than the Department of Health and Human Services said if you simply allowed cross state sales of health insurance we would have eight million fewer people uninsured in America today. Now, here's the point.  It's not -- the key isn't that you will be able to get a cheaper policy. The problem is the insurance companies are cheating us right now.  They're charging too much because they don't have to compete.\", 'The reality is -- [talking simultaneously]', 'Your goal is my -- Female Speaker: [inaudible]', \"Your goal is my goal.  Long ago, I embraced universal coverage.  One point we haven't talked about tonight very much is how many people are going to lose the coverage they have.  You said how do we get to that right healthcare system.  I'll tell you how.  Number one, allow the people that like their plan to keep their plan.  Number two, deal with the issue of the uninsured by giving them a refundable tax credit. Give them cash --\", \"I think we should trust them.  However, in this instance, we didn't.  And point of fact, when Obamacare passed, it was opposed by roughly 54 percent of the American people. Each day it's opposed by somewhere closer to 60 percent of the people.  There is no poll out there yet that says that it's favored by more people than not.  But more importantly than that -- and this is a key point -- when a nation that is a democracy makes a radical change in public policy, it should be reflected not by the narrowest of consensus but by a very broad consensus.  When Social Security was adopted, more than 80 percent of the members of the Congress, House and Senate, voted for the creation of Social Security. When Medicare and Medicare were created, more than 70 percent of the members of Congress supported those programs.  When SCHIP was adopted, again, the numbers were well over 75 percent of the members of Congress.\", 'When this bill passed, it passed by the slimmest of margins.

Yes, Republicans passed the opportunity when they hold both majorities of Congress.  But quite frankly, we did not have the demand that we have now seen.

Have you defended it other than to say -- other than to say, well, back then, the Republican Party was responsible, and now it's not.  That's really -- quite frankly, in the context of what happened last week, inappropriate.\", \"The current system is broken.  There is no question about it.  It's broken because it costs too much, it's broken because there are too many people who don't have insurance, and it's tragically broken because some people are denied care because they have a chronic illness or preexisting condition.  We need to address those problems, and there are lots of reforms that we can to address them.  We can allow group pooling.  We can force the insurance companies to become cost conscious and to have to compete with each other. We can give you control over your health insurance.  We can move away from third party payer systems.  And we can begin to redo the system.  But we don't have to say that it's not universal care.  Indeed, my legislation and other legislation that Republicans have offered provide universal coverage. My legislation says you give every single American a tax credit.  For the poor, you give them a refundable tax credit, an amount of money.  In the Coburn legislation and the Ryan legislation, you write specific dollar amounts for people to buy health insurance, and it's cash in their hands to go buy a coverage that they choose.  So we achieve universal coverage, every single American.  You can do universal enrollment as I described, where you're automatically enrolled in that process.  We can deal with the problem of the uninsured without forcing a million Americans who like their current coverage to lose it, which is what Obamacare will do.  You will force millions of Americans to lose the coverage they currently have and they currently like.  And we can deal with the problem of preexisting conditions.  I had heart bypass surgery.  I have a preexisting condition.  I care about this issue.  I have an older sister -- my oldest sister, who has breast cancer.  No one should be denied healthcare because they have a preexisting condition.  But we can do that without forcing everybody out of the coverage they have now. But rather by creating high risk pools that are funded by all the other insurance companies or by government, and helping those who are in need because they have high risks.  Americans will happily pay to support people who have that kind of condition because they dont know when they will have it next.  High risk pools will work for those with preexisting conditions.\"]\n",

      "[\"I guess so.  I was starting to get thick around the middle, yes.  It's true. 19:24:53.8 Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710\", \"Thank you.  You know, all these arguments are telling.  But I'm going to approach profiling from -- first I'd like to say that I have a daughter from Pakistan.  And I have a lot of Pakistani visas.  And she's from Faisalabad, it's from a center of terror, a lot of terrorists have come there.  And I would fit that profile as well. And I'll say it now.  I don't mind being stopped.  And I have been stopped.  But we have -- you have to look at this -- what I think is a mistake is if we let this devolve, this argument, into Islam against the West or the United States against the West.  Let me take an example.  It may seem a bit facetious, but it's a very real one. The secret service has a source inside the Aryan brotherhood. 19:25:56.3 A source says there's going to be an attempt on a black American president.  It's going to take place inside Washington, D.C.  And that's all the details I have.  Maybe it's going to be a rocket. Maybe it's going to be a service to air missile that can hit a helicopter.  The D.C. police are informed, the FBI, Homeland Security. And all we know at this point is it's probably going to take place in a week.  What does the secret service do [unintelligible] the FBI.  They do triage.  They are going to be looking for white males with tattoos, short haircuts, frequenting certain places of a certain economic stature. Those people are going to be profiled.  So I think it's important to get away from this is a crusade against Islam because that's not what it is.  Let's take the Israelis. 19:26:56.9 Whatever side you come down on that, they have a certain experience in the Middle East. Call it profiling, call it what you will.  I was in Lebanon in the '80s.  And their assumption when they invaded in 1982 is they were going to have a problem with Palestinian Muslims.  By 1987, the problem was not with Palestinian Muslims.  It was with Christian women.  First suicide bombers were Christian and women.  Their profile went from religion to a fairly light Maronite and orthodox Christians. The whole idea of profiling has to do with triage.  If you're TSA or the FBI or the CIA, you have a limited amount of time, and you have to understand the background and the religion of people. Let's take Iran today.  Everybody calls it a terrorist state. 19:27:56.8 But give me one example when an Iranian has committed suicide either on a plane or a car bomb or anywhere else.  They just don't do it.  Look at the history going back to Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 1980.  Yes, they did on the front.  But they were never involved in terrorism.  If I am the TSA supervisor, and you have a plane and a threat, and you can only check a certain amount of people, I would write off the Iranians first of all.  Within Islam, there is profiling in Saudi Arabia.  They can pinpoint the cities, the villages and the school of Islam that is likely to commit suicide bombings.  When's the last time there's been a bombing on a Saudi airline?  Hasn't been one.  They know who's getting on.  And they can identify the religious school which happens to be Hanafi, that has a proclivity for this. 19:28:56.3 Yes, they profile.  But at the end of the day, we -- the problem is we are a liberal society. Our intelligence, having served 21 years in the CIA and having tried and failed many times, is not good.  We are not the Israelis.  The Israelis know every single Palestinian, who gets on, who's safe, who needs to be searched, who doesn't. Scanners don't do it.  You can take PETN and you can insert it in a cavity, and the chances of a scanner picking this up are remote.  Behavior, look at the 9/11 bombers. They went to bars the night before.  They were drinking.  If the FBI had been after them, they wouldn't have fit a profile for -- nothing in their behavior before -- they didn't go to the mosque. 19:29:56.6 They didn't do any preaching, anything like that.  And once they got on the airplane, I have seen the film.  They looked pretty normal to me.  But had TSA been around, and had they looked at this, they could have figured out where those -- the muscle 15 came from in Saudi Arabia, and say, yes, that school of Islam had a proclivity for doing suicide bombings. Another thing, we go back to triage and why this profiling is in a sense repulsive because it is based on a certain amount of racism.  Let's face it.  But there isn't a choice. And because the triage changes from day to day, you look at the Tamils, there's still a war going on.  If you're at JFK, and you get a threat to Air India, it's going to be a suicide bomber, and Air India and TSA have to go through triage. They are going to be looking at people who are darker, because the Tamils are. 19:30:57.8 They're Hindus.  They have certain names.  And in no way is this -- you are selecting them out for a secondary search.  This will happen in almost any good airport in the world.  I just came back from Sydney.  They stopped me.  They wanted to know who I was.  I'm white, middle class.  Don't look like a suicide bomber.  But they did a credit check at the airport, pulled me aside because I was an American.  I realize it doesnt have anything to do with religion, but they profiled me.  They established who I was.  I was let on that airplane.  So this is why I urge that as difficult a decision it is, that we have to Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 profile to help our intelligence services.  And there isn't a choice.\", 'I go for the inclusive. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 19:50:57.3 I mean, you know, with Christmas day bomber, he was from Nigeria.

I would have hoped, if there had been a TSA at the time, that they would have started looking at Israeli Jews.  And would I have been called anti-Semitic at the time?  Absolutely.  But the fact is that was the first hijacking.  It has nothing to do with Islam.\", \"Well, it's triage.  It's never going to be completely accurate.  But if you take a black American who just spent the last five years in Yemen, it wasn't for --\", \"And then you ask him if he's converted.\", 'Well, of course it works.', 'I always getting profiled in Tel Aviv.', 'You made that point.  Without an educated TSA, this is going to lead to racist disaster.', 'This is why the Israelis put young men and women, well-educated, college educated who are very sensitive and they do not sit and insult these people.  But theres a point we have not touched on, it is that we are in two wars in the Middle East, that we are killing Muslims, and one war is illegal, the Iraq war, and thats just a fact.  And a lot of this is where weve taken sides in the wars in the Middle East. 20:00:56.7 We need some sort of reaction in this country to defend ourselves. [talking simultaneously]', 'Well Id go back to Israel. Its a simple one.  Thereve been no attacks on airplanes. They do profile, profile white, middle age Christian Americans and they tend to leave the Orthodox and they know who the Orthodox are. 20:03:52.9 Before they get on the airplane, they profile flight lists before they get on.  And if you just take that one example, it works.', 'Well, they are profiled.', 'I mean, if I go to the tribal areas of Pakistan, you can count on it that I would -- [laughter]', \"Well, no, any place we're at war with, same with Iraq.\", \"Yes, I'm profiled. 20:15:53.5\", \"I apologize for ending this on a bit of an academic note, but I would like to take a country that I'm not particularly fond of and I wrote a book about, and they're not fond of me either, and that's Saudi Arabia. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 [laughter] Saudi Arabia had a very bad terrorism problem 2003, 2004.  Princes were being killed. Car bombs were going off.  And we got a new king in Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah. And he sat down with his intelligence chief, Hamid bin Naif [spelled phonetically]. And he said profile. 20:30:57.4 Who are the people.  Where are they coming from, what tribe, what sect, what religion. The first thing they sat down, and they eliminated immediately Saudi Shia who were an oppressed minority.  But they were not blowing themselves up.  They were not turning to suicide bombings, radical Islam.  Since then, all attacks on Saudi Arabia have come from outside the country.  They have whipped the problem.  Of course, it's a home-grown problem.  They knew about it. But what they did was they profiled.  I would prefer if we had the opportunity and we had the intelligence to base all of our profiling on behavior, tickets, flight lists, the history of people, digital databases, credit checks.  But right now, this country does not have that capacity to run an algorithm through every single flight that comes into this country. 20:31:57.8 Nor can it even keep track of the people that are in this country.  And this forces the police and TSOs to fall back on a very primitive unattractive weapon.  But it's the only weapon we have at this point until our intelligence gets better.  Thank you.\"]\n",
      "['John, I was in the system last night when I flew back from Nashville.', 'Well, I have not yet.  And I guess that may come up at some point in the future.  But let me be clear, John, if you touch my junk -- [laughter]', 'Thank you very much.  Let\\'s begin with a thought experiment.  Just imagine that you work at JFK International Airport here in New York City, and you\\'re in a Federal Express facility inspecting incoming packages that have just been pulled off of a jet that\\'s landed from Heathrow Airport in London.  And you\\'re clearing these parcels that can be taken Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 on across America and delivered to their destinations.  And you see a package from Somalia, and it\\'s addressed to a synagogue in San Francisco.  \"Hmm,\" you think to yourself, \"that\\'s kind of unusual.\"  So you call over your supervisor, you take a look at it, you discuss the package, and you decide that you\\'re going to put it aside until a bomb- sniffing dog can come over and render its opinion on the matter.  Congratulations, you just engaged in profiling.  Now, obviously, packages are not people.  Fed Ex boxes have neither civil rights nor emotions.  People do and we always must be aware of and sensitive to that.  However, in a world of limited time, personnel, and money, we have no choice but to focus on those people who threaten to destroy aircraft and the flying public who ride within them. 18:54:59.0 And that is why my team and I urge you to vote in favor of tonight\\'s resolution, \"U.S. airports should use racial and religious profiling.\"  Let me emphasize that we do not advocate letting airport security personnel cater to their own personal ethnic or ecclesiastical biases.  Instead, we want the TSA and others to recognize that the current threat to passengers and airliners comes almost exclusively from one source, and we all know what it is, young males between about 18 and 35 who practice a fundamentalist strain of the Islamic faith, and generally hail from the Middle East, as well as largely Muslim nations in Africa and South Asia.  There are exceptions to this profile, but they\\'re quite rare indeed.  We learned about this profile on September 11 when all the hijackers who attacked us that day fit the parameters that I\\'ve identified. 18:55:52.2 Had the security personnel at Newark, Dulles, or Boston-Logan Airports profiled these hijackers, they might have been stopped and nearly 3,000 people who were killed on 9/11 would be with us here today.  In a few minutes you will hear from my colleague, Asra Nomani.  She will demonstrate that this profile did not begin on September 11 and it did not end then either.  My colleague, Bob Baer, a former intelligence officer, will explain that what we advocate is a response to intelligence.  He also will show that preventing terror at and through America\\'s airports involves responding to the evolving threat profile that faces us at any given time.  Now, mind you, we are not arguing that the TSA should send anyone named Mohammed to be water boarded somewhere between the first class lounge and the Pizza Hut. [laughter] However, if you are a male between about 18 and 35 and are traveling on a Middle Eastern passport or one from a predominantly Muslim country, it might be smart to ask you a few extra questions, carefully peruse your papers, and if things seem unusual we perhaps should take a closer look at your luggage. 18:57:01.6 Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 This really is not religious or racial profiling so much as it is terrorist profiling.  We want to increase, not decrease, the probability that our security personnel will stop terrorists before they can board passenger jets, and once again turn them into bombs and missiles. This differs little from what police departments do today to deploy their limited resources in order to raise the odds of successfully reducing crime.  If the NYPD were seeking a mafia hit man who just flew in from Naples to whack somebody, I doubt the NYPD would dispatch squad cars to 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard.  If you set up a sobriety checkpoint, if youre a police department, you most likely would put it somewhere near bars, not close to churches.  Similarly, if a wave of bank robberies were committed by a black man between ages 45 and 50, and if he were just under six feet tall, and lived in Manhattans East Village, I would not be shocked if the police stopped me and asked me a few questions. 18:57:58.0 Why?  I perfectly fit that profile.  Now, would that leave me thrilled and delighted? Probably not, but I would know that these law enforcement officers were doing their jobs, and that, I would understand.  Does my team advocate violating peoples rights? Absolutely not.  Remember, among the rights that officials need to protect is the right to fly on a plane and assume that it will land at your destination with you and your fellow passengers alive and well at your destination. That right deserves maximum attention from those who we pay to keep us safe from those who want us dead.  Our opponents might say that the profile we\\'ve identified would miss someone like Timothy McVeigh, the non-Muslim man who blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. However, to look more carefully at someone does not mean that you ignore everyone else. This resolution is not an either/or proposition. 18:58:54.4 Terrorist profiling can exist with wisely applied traditional screening measures for other passengers.  Finally, what if we avoid terrorist profiling?  At best, we will keep wasting scarce resources by subjecting everyone to the same time consuming often humiliating searches that have generated such public outrage recently.  The TSA can keep checking the prosthetic breasts of American women who have endured mastectomies as happened a few months ago to Cathy Bossi, a 32-year veteran airline employee.  At worst, TSA officers might come face-to-face with a bomb-wielding passenger who fits the terrorist profile but then breezed him through security because they dont want to make him uncomfortable.  The result could be a deadly airborne attack that we all have feared since September 11.  My team wants to prevent this from happening and we hope you do, too. Please join us in supporting tonights resolution, U.S. Airports should use racial and religious profiling.  Thank you very much. 18:59:57.7 [applause] Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.

As I pointed out in my opening remarks --\", '-- this is not an either/or proposition. 19:48:51.4 I believe that we ought to include, in our airport activities, racial and religious profiling. But nothing here in the resolution says that would be to the exclusion of behavioral profiling or anything else.

And I think it's important to point out, as I think we've alluded, that the threat profile can change.  We heard earlier about Puerto Rican terrorists.  There is a wonderful bar here in town called Fronts Tavern [spelled phonetically].  That was blown up by people who wanted Puerto Rican independence back in the 1970s.  Even earlier than that, back in the 1950s, they opened fire on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Well, over time, people who were interested in independence for Puerto Rico have expressed that through peaceful means. There is no longer a violence profile regarding people who are interested in Puerto Rican independence.  It's really not something which we check for.  At the moment, however, those people who we do see as targeting our aircraft and people upon them happen, almost always, to be people who are Islamic and very often from the Middle East. 19:49:51.0\", \"That's exactly the point I'm making.\", \"Precisely the point I'm making.

The -- basically a bag that collects urine burst, and this poor man was covered in his own urine and had to fly on a plane that way.  And so my question to Michael Chertoff, who I guess you supervised the TSA when you were secretary of Homeland Security.

Why should we call it the status quo rather than using racial and religious profiling in our arguments?\", 'I happen to think the United States is a force for good, so I would -- Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 [applause] I certainly reject the premise of your question.', 'Well thank you very much and thank you to my opponents and my colleagues for what I think has been an excellent and lively debate.  I think the general position that weve heard from the other side is that since its impossible to catch everyone who might pose a threat to our country and our flying public and who want to kill us, therefore we shouldnt even attempt to find those who might have those malicious intentions. 20:21:04.9 It is true that you might, in an effort to catch everyone who happens to be a Muslim, perhaps not catch someone like Jose Padilla who was of Hispanic background and converted to Islam or perhaps people who have gone through Prislam as I believe Debra put it who have gone to prison and been radicalized there and might be black and therefore they might slip through the profile. But because they might not go through the profile doesnt mean that we ignore the fact that people from the Middle East who are Islamic, unfortunately they represent the profile of the people who threaten this country at this time.  I think you certainly can check by looking at things like passports which definitely will give us a sense of where they come from maybe not on a domestic flight but certainly on international flights and people going through international airports.  I also think that if al Qaeda gets smart and says Well I guess theyre looking for people who like those who were 9/11 hijackers we probably should go to the trouble of finding women who are blonde haired, blue-eyed. 20:21:55.7 Let al Qaeda go to the trouble of finding blonde-haired, blue-eyed women who agree with them and want to blow themselves up then its going to be a lot more difficult for them to fish around in that pool than to find more Muslim men who are 18 to 35. [applause] Lets at least make things difficult for them.  The last point Id make is the consequences of this. Im very sympathetic to the point Hassan has made about Muslim children asking their parents if theyre going through questioning at the airports, Daddy, did you do something wrong?  Daddy, are we criminals?  That is very tragic and very sad.  But I think the other consequence we must remember is if somebody slips through and we have Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 something like the plane flying over Detroit which was attacked; fortunately, the bomb did not go off.  If we have something like that happen, we have much, much worse consequences than people feeling duly upset and saddened.  We want to keep them alive no matter where theyre from. [applause]']\n",
      "['No, I mean, I was happy to take the train from DC today.  [unintelligible]', 'I want to first thank all of you for coming to talk about this really important discussion. We all know it\\'s in the news.  We know that it is something that matters to us personally. And I want to thank the panel from the other side and my own teammates for daring to talk about something that is so sensitive that oftentimes it is a taboo topic. 19:08:56.5 And it especially is one inside of our Muslim community.  It is one that hurts us.  It is one that causes me great pain to actually come and speak to you about.  When I first got the invitation, the assumption was that I would be speaking against the motion.  But after several years of pondering on this really difficult topic, I firmly believe that U.S. airports should profile based on religion and racial issues.  I came to this country at the age of four in the summer of 1969 on a TWA jet from Bombay to John F. Kennedy airport. Ever since then, I have loved travel.  I have loved the airline industry.  I came from a very conservative Muslim family.  Islam has been a part of my life.  It\\'s been a part of my being.  But something very sad has happened in the 40 years since, both inside of our Muslim community and inside of the airline industry. 19:09:58.5 Inside of our Muslim community, we have had the emergence of a very real interpretation of Islam that justifies the attack on airports and airliners and civilian targets.  This is a reality that is really difficult to accept sometimes inside of our community.  But it\\'s a truth.  And I want to chronicle how this unfolded over these recent years.  And inside of the airline industry, we have seen Pan Am leave us.  We have seen TWA die off.  The airline industry is also under great pressure.  Airplane crashes, airline security issues have serious consequences, not just on the traveling public but on this really important industry. . And this issue of profiling has been the taboo topic in the midst of all of this conversation. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 19:10:58.4 I do come from a Muslim family.  I am brown, for radio audience members who can\\'t see me.  My father has Mohammed in his name.  He\\'s 80-some years old, but he gets pulled at the security checkpoint.  And still I stand before you and I say, profile me.  Profile my family.  Profile my father because inside of our Muslim community, I fundamentally believe that we have failed to police ourselves.  We have failed our country here in America.  We have failed our world.  I express my deepest sorrow and sympathy to Debra, to all of you who have felt the trauma of September 11.  And I recognize that we as a nation, both in the U.S. and inside of our Muslim communities, have largely not yet even healed. 19:11:57.3 We are struggling with how to deal with this very real incredible threat that exists out there.  And religion, ethnicity and issues of race have a very direct relationship with issues of violence.  A wonderful study by the State University of New York at Albany concluded, what makes terrorist organizations more lethal is religious ideology.  When you combine religion and ethno-nationalism, you get a dangerous combination.  We saw that dangerous combination on September 11.  It was the manifestation of an interpretation inside of our Muslim world that justified an attack on an airport and on airliners.  There was a fatwa issued by Osama Bin Laden in 1998 when he had created the international Islamic front for fighting the Jews and crusaders. 19:13:01.3 And he established very clearly in his marching orders, Bring down their aircraft.  Have the attack be one of violence that is pitiless.  He was very clear in what his objective was.  And I have before me a Koran that comes from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  And I want to establish really clearly that this ideology is one that permeates inside of our community, giving young men then the religious justification to do that which they want. And in it it says Guide us to the straight way.  It\\'s a very simple message.  But what the government of Saudi Arabia has done is added into here, unlike the way of the Jews and the Christians.  And so this ideology is the ideology that fuels the extremism that makes airports and airliners targets. 19:14:00.8 And it\\'s not just the stuff of rhetoric.  Bojinka, 1990s, plot by Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to bring down jetliners coming from Asia to the U.S.  Scotland, Glasgow, airport attack attempt, the millennium bomber attempt in the Los Angeles Airport was also a successful event, not at just behavioral profiling, but a warning had gone out to look out for men of Middle Eastern origin, and so the customs officials actually had an eye out for the man who was trying to put bombs on baggage carts at Los Angeles Airport. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 19:14:48.0 And 2007, JFK Airport, that airport where I arrived, there were young Muslim men who said, \"Let us attack John F.

If you hit that, this whole country will be mourning.  You can kill the man twice.\" This is the stuff of the operations and the actual attacks that are inside of our community.  I\\'m not happy that this is happening inside of our community, but I tell you that we must be honest about it, and I urge you to vote for the motion that U.S. airports should use religious and racial profiling.

I mean, Im really glad that Michael, Debra and Hassan chronicled for us who the attackers have been.  What is the one distinguishing characteristic of all of them?  Theyre Muslims.  We cannot deny that fact. We dont pretend to have the answers on how were going to profile well, Ill be honest with you.  This is something that we have to identify.  But the truth is that if we exclude religion and religiosity and interpretation of religion in our assessment of risk as was done to my father then we are not being honest about the threat as it exists today.', 'Well you know, does it make any sense what were doing with the pat-downs?  You know, what was happening was that, I think, weve got this very impractical approach to security at airports right now and what I really believe we need to do is get a more common sense approach.  We need to really look at who the adversary is and be very realistic about those type of individuals.

And if I could, I mean, I would suggest to Hassan's question. 19:51:54.6 I mean, how about if we take a few dollars away from this new security system that we have called cop-a-feel security, and basically turn it to some intelligent analysis of what the threat is about.\", \"That's not what we're talking about at all.  That is absolutely not what we're talking about. There is a phenomenon where they want to talk now about flying while Muslim to compare it to that same issue of driving while black. 19:53:55.5 But the truth is that we don't have to be discriminatory in order to be discriminating.  We don't have to be prejudicial if we're going to be pragmatic.  We can be very realistic about this.  And just to point out this issue of threat, there have been 60 incidents since 1970 of attacks on airports and airliners.  And in 1970, who were the attackers?  It was the Jewish Defense League, the Black Panthers, Black September, so the threat was very different from the threat that we have today.  But it would have been very realistic and important for our national security and our airport security personnel to target those kinds of individuals because they were the ones who were perpetuating that kind of crime.  Our motion is not about figuring out how we're going to do it.  We need to come to agreement I think and send a really important message that we are going to put away political correctness and look very practically at the issues of race and religion as they impact airport security. 19:54:57.7 What Michael is trying to do is take us down a path that I'm afraid we're not paid enough to do.\", 'And a woman?', 'Oh yeah, I saw their hands. 20:01:54.0', \"We had one question that we didn't answer.\", \"Up here, which was that we're making assumptions, because, for example --\", 'The person who did the Mumbai attack--', \"But what I would actually argue is that, for example, in the case of the Mumbai attacks, and this -- this man, David Headley, he was Muslim.

But obviously, in terrorist circles, there is something that they call false flag operations, where people try to hide their own identity.

He said that They looked like Arab terrorists if I'd ever seen them, according to the media reports when he was interviewed.  If that man could have participated in some type of religious and racial profiling, perhaps the tragedy that we knew on 9/11 could have been mitigated somewhat.  And that is the motion.

I know every single one of you, no matter what your narrative has faced some sort of discrimination in your life. There is no need to add trauma to people who have already been traumatized.  But to argue that we will create new extremists is, I think, -- is completely without basis because they have enough reason to hate us. 20:26:57.0 That same Saudi Koran that I read to you, that translation, it says then when the sacred months have passed, then kill the nonbelievers wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them.

It's not what speaks from Hassan's heart.  But there is a minority inside of our global community today who believe this interpretation of Islam.

And you do have pangs of guilt, but they're pangs, and they go away when you realize that there's a larger issue here in terms of what's of benefit to U.S. national interest.\", \"Thank you.  It's an honor to be here tonight, particularly on this stage with Peter and Max, who are all acknowledged experts in this field.  Also a little daunting.  I've done a lot of panels.  I've never done a debate with clocks and buzzers and voting.  So cut me some slack.  I'm also local.  I'm from Jersey, if that helps in the voting process as well. [applause] But I just want to say also, too, if there're any Marines in the room, happy birthday Marines.  Today is the 235th birthday of the Marine Corps.  [applause]  And it's appropriate to be having this discussion tonight because, you know, so far this year in Afghanistan, or so far this month in Afghanistan, the first ten days in November, we've seen 16 service members killed, many of them marines. So it's important for us to have a discussion on a day like this because it's those service members and their families who are bearing the direct costs of this conflict.  You're going to hear tonight a lot of nuanced and complex arguments between us.  And that's about right because the United States is entangled in a very complicated situation.  To use the term civil war is not incorrect. You're going to hear us disagree on the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda.  I found, in my experience, in both eastern and southern Afghanistan, that the vast, vast majority of the Taliban that are fighting our Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 troops every day are not wedded to an ideology that al-Qaeda embraces, that they are fighting occupation, and they are not fighting for some type of transnational jihad. You will see us disagree over the similarities between the Iraq and Afghan surge.  Again, I was in both.  I was fully invested in the Iraq surge in 2006 in Anbar province, I was one of the first civilian surge members last year into Afghanistan.  And there are similarities between the Iraq surge and the Afghan surge.  But those similarities are more in terms of how the US is doing policy and how we didn't do things right to begin with in Iraq and now all those policies we're doing wrong in Afghanistan.  And I look forward to a discussion.  I know Nir's got a lot of comments on this, and I look forward to having this talk with Peter and Max.  You're also going to hear a lot of facts, figures and statistics tonight.  And I want you to keep in mind the big picture.  I want you to ask, so what? After every fact or figure or statistic you hear.  Hopefully when Peter and Max say it and not when Nir and I say it, because it's just a case of don't lose sight or track of the forest because of the trees. And so keep in mind, bear in mind some basic aspects of the war in Afghanistan.  The cost. Last year we spent -- the United States spent $104 billion in Afghanistan.  This year, we are projected to spend $119 billion in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's GDP is $14 billion.  We are spending seven times as much in that country as it's worth.  As the Dutch, the Canadian, probably the French and Italians move out of Afghanistan, of course, our costs will go up.  And so when you hear the administration say, we're looking at keeping this policy in place till 2014, that's a half trillion price tag plus about 2400 dead American and coalition soldiers as well as thousands more Afghans at this pace. Keep in mind that since 2005, we have seen a fivefold increase in U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan.  Literally every year since 2005, we have doubled the foreign troop presence in Afghanistan.  And what's occurred from that is that only every year a commensurate rise in violence, a commensurate rise in support for the Taliban and a decrease in support for the Karzai government.  You see this with a number of Taliban. In 2005, we estimated there are 2000 active duty fighters in Afghanistan.  Now we're estimating there are 35 to 40,000 active duty Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.  So not only is the policy expensive, failing, it's also counterproductive because it's causing people to join the insurgency. It's exasperating the conflict, and it's making the region less stable.  And that includes Pakistan. Additionally, keep in mind the nature of al-Qaeda.  Keep in mind it is only 50 to a hundred members of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, according to our CIA.  And contrast Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 that with the 1,000 -- the 2,000 members of al-Qaeda that our State Department said are still in Iraq in their report last August on terrorism.  Contrast that with the fact that the German police say there are 45 members of al-Qaeda in Hamburg, Germany.  Hamburg being the place that probably had as much to do with the planning, if not more, for the 9/11 attacks than Afghanistan.  And before I forget to put a plug in for a great article on the nature of al-Qaeda on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and on 9/11, please read the New Yorker article from September by Terry McDermott.  Really shows how al-Qaeda is this grouping of individuals. It's a collection of individuals.  It's not a formal military organization that we can defeat with conventional forces.  And think about it.  Look back at the last 10 years of their attacks.  Their most recent attack, a lady who took two parcel bombs and FedExed them from Yemen.  Look at the attacks of the last three years in this country in the sense that they're done by individuals, small cells, it's a decentralized organization that will not be affected by the presence of brigade combat teams occupying Southern Afghanistan.  So nine years ago 19 men hijacked four airplanes.  We're now in Afghanistan 109 months later with 100,000 troops spending over $100 billion a year.  Nir and I are not advocating for us to cut and run or abandon Afghanistan but we are advocating for a policy that is not destabilizing, not counterproductive, and not effective against Afghanistan. We're arguing for something that will -- or against al-Qaeda, we're actually arguing for something that will affect al-Qaeda and stabilize the region.  Thank you. [applause]\", \"The main thing is our troops aren't fighting al-Qaeda.  They're fighting Taliban.  They're fighting people who are upset that we're occupying their villages and valleys.  The U.S. intelligence community will cite -- you can look at the Boston globe from September 2009, that nine out of ten members of the Taliban are members of the Taliban because of foreign occupation and because of an ongoing civil war.  I actually support Peter and Max's polls.  60 percent or 68 percent of Afghans are for our presence.  32 percent are violently opposed to the point they'll take up rifles.  This -- Afghanistan is not a homogenous society.  It's a regionalized, localized society with many, many different Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 ethnic schisms, regional schisms. There are Hatfield and McCoy type situations that our troops are finding themselves in the middle every day.  And remember, this war goes back to the '70s.  The reason the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan was because the country was already at war. So we -- in 2001, when we intervened, the country was at civil war.  We took one side out of power and put the other side in power, but we didn't address those underlying root causes of the conflict. Now, getting back to the polling data, again, I support that.  You probably have about a 60/40 split in the country.  I'll also say that some of the things -- you've got to look at the polling data real well because, yes, 7 percent of the population supports the Taliban. However, in the Asia Foundation poll that was just cited, 80 percent of the population supported talking to the Taliban and negotiating with them.  Here is the deal, if you are given a choice, if you are a rural Pashtun villager, and you are given a choice between the Taliban who are ethnically and culturally similar to you or the Karzai government which is made of up non-rural Pashtuns, outsiders who are corrupt and who are backed up by an invading and occupying army, which are you going to choose?\", \"It's a bad choice.\", 'I resent the idea that the Taliban or the opponents of the Taliban in Afghanistan are wearing white hats, is not true.', \"Neither side are paradigms of women's rights or anything in this conflict.\", 'Were not advocating us leaving.', \"You know, two things, one, I don't think al-Qaeda needs a safe haven and wants a safe haven. I'd like them to go back into safe haven.  I'd love for them to open [unclear] farms back in Kandahar because then we could bomb them. They do not operate in any manner that we're going to -- they don't operate in a manner that we can attack with conventional forces.  Again, look at the history of attacks in the last ten years.  I urge you to go to the Heritage Foundation website, the Heritage Foundation, not a limp-wristed, left-leaning organization by any means.  And you'll see that they documented the 30 attacks against the United States by transnational terror groups, primarily by al-Qaeda, for the last ten years.  And you'll see it's all done by individuals in small cells who don't require large safe havens.  Since 2001 al-Qaeda has evolved into an organization that is decentralized, it's near virtual, and it does not exist in a manner that we can attack.  And actually the RAND corporation did a study two years ago.  And it found that 84 percent of all terrorist groups since the '60s have met their end by either police action, by intelligence action or by political action.  So the smart way to go about them is to attack al-Qaeda as they actually exist and not as we want them to be or not how they were 10 years ago. They're an organization like any other organization.  They evolve.  Organizations tend not to devolve.  It does not make any sense why al-Qaeda would want to go to a place or go back into a form where they could be readily attacked by our aircraft, our cruise missiles, our commandos. And like I said, if they did, that's great, because then we could go after them that way.\", 'We did.  When we got there in 2001 we were welcomed.  People didnt like the Taliban. They didnt receive their support.  They fled to Pakistan.  We stayed and supported a clique that was the government.  The government was exclusionary. And so what you had happen over time, that period from 2002 to 2005 was the American troops never left.  We spent a lot of money there that went to enrich a few people and we supported and propped up a corrupt and illegitimate government that was exclusionary. When I say exclusionary, one thing I have to say again, going back to Afghanistan, it is a very ethnically regional and localized country.  This is as if -- now were talking about the government -- I was embedded with the Afghan government.  I ate a couple of meals with them a day.  I had the parasite to prove it. [laughter] Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 our federal government put me, a guy from Jersey, in charge of a parish in Louisiana and sent the New York National Guard to keep me in power.  Thats the dynamic that you see there.  And this idea about -- just to get back -- another thing about the government, the idea that were on the side of good and the Soviet Union was on the side of bad, again, the Afghans dont see it that way. Its such a confused conflict there.  But I can tell you that the Afghan army brigade commander I worked with, the Afghan police commander I worked with, and the Afghan intelligence chief I worked with were all Moscow trained.  They had all fought on the side of the Soviets.  The Afghan army was well over 100,000 people at times.  Kabul was so safe for the Soviets that Soviet administrators used to live in Kabul with their families. The Soviets had 20,000 civilian advisors there.  So the idea that what were doing -- I agree with parts of what Max said about the difference between us and the Soviets but there are also similarities that really cant be ignored.', '[unintelligible], John.  Just to answer that real quick?', \"Two things:  One, does al-Qaeda receive more recruits because we occupy two Muslim countries or because of a supposed loss in Afghanistan?  And also, too, we're not talking Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 about losing or running from Afghanistan.  We're talking about getting a political process that resolves 30 years of conflict in Afghanistan.  In 2000 -- go into Pakistan.  In 2001, Pakistan had two insurgencies. They had insurgency in Sindh and an insurgency in Balochistan.  They didn't have insurgency in the Pashtun areas.  There were extremist groups there, but there was not an insurgency.  The Pakistani Taliban did not come into existence until 2006 or 2007 and had popular support from the Pashtun people until we had the Islamabad government send the army into there, which hadn't occurred for 40, 50 years, and until our drones start showing up.  So if anything, if you look at what's happened to Pakistan in the last 10 years, our presence and our continued escalation of Afghanistan, that has destabilized Pakistan.  So, again, were not talking about cutting and running from Afghanistan. We're talking about having a political process that ends 30 years of war that stabilizes not just Afghanistan but Pakistan as well.\", 'You guys do your homework. [laughter]', \"Well, you know, they're both true.  They are.  I mean --\", \"If you look at -- again, if you look at this conflict that's been going on for 30 years, if you understand that the Taliban are not a monolithic organization, that they're composed of multiple local groups with legitimate political grievances, then there is a need to negotiate to end the conflict. Go home tonight and look up a thing called the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq in 2005.  This was our document.  And I worked on it when I was in the State Department in 2005 after I came back from Iraq my first time.  Go and look it up.  We called it the NSVI.  And it says the same things about the Iraqi insurgency.  It's monolithic.  They're Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 all terrorists.  We can't negotiate with them.  We can't leave Iraq because it will become a safe haven for terrorism.  So the same things we did in 2003 to 2006, in terms of lumping the Iraqi insurgency together, calling them all terrorists, the same things we're doing now in Afghanistan.  What changed in Iraq?  And I can tell you when I was there in Anbar province, where --\", 'Yeah, sure.  The point --', 'Very cautious hope that there will be a breakthrough that we would start to peel off elements of the insurgency and shatter the insurgency and splinter the insurgency.', \"Well, it depends what the cause is.

Matthew Hoh: The cause -- I think I wasn't -- I probably didn't have this debate in mind when I was talking to -- [laughter] I mean -- you know, but honestly --\", 'No, of course not.  No.', \"Cautious hope and optimism for talks to end the conflict through -- I think I've been clear the entire night about the need for reconciliation.\", 'When I was bringing up Iraq before, this is what we did for three or four years in Iraq. We conflated all the groups together, did not address any of the local grievances that those groups had. They had been usurped from power, they were excluded from the government.  The outsiders were occupying them. This is -- if we want to keep this kind of mindset about the Taliban, then we can fight them for decades. Has everyone seen the film Gladiator? Okay, remember in the beginning theyre fighting the Germans and one general turns to Russell Crow and says Dont people ever know when theyre beaten?  And Russell Crow says, Would you?  Same thing.  This is human nature.  It is, its human nature. Who here as a kid watched Red Dawn? [laughter] Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Okay?  Right?  I mean, when I went into the Marine Corp, you know, I grew up in my 10 years in the Marine Corp, Red Dawn was probably my favorite movie, okay?  If the Russians had invaded, I would have fought them.  Its the same type of principle, okay? Were dealing with people who primarily see the reason for supporting the Taliban as occupation and a government that excludes them. If we drive a wedge between them and the Taliban who [unintelligible], Im not saying there are no Taliban who are aligned with al Qaeda.  There are.  But split them.  Why fight all of them when we can negotiate with 80 percent of them.', 'Yeah, the U.S. has spent since 2001, 50 billion dollars on foreign assistance in Afghanistan.

So what is the biggest tragedy Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 for an American family is a rite of passage for an Afghan family.  Access to electricity is less than 10 percent for the Afghan people and when I say access, thats three to four hours.  There have been some successes.  But this is still a country that is ripped apart by war.  So what you need to do is find a way to keep those successes and end the conflict in the other part of the country.  So it is, its a mixed thing but to say that theyve only benefited from our presence there, some have but many, many have not.', \"Actually, when I was in Iraq, I was a combat engineer in the Marine Corps where I had to actually go out and look for IEDs.

Gareth Porter, a journalist for Inter Press Service --\", \"We know it's not working, Max, because --\", \"No, we're not starting to do it.

But I would urge you all to see the film Restrepo--it's a documentary done by a journalist-- to see what it's like to be an American infantryman in Afghanistan.  But that film was done three and a half years ago. And you see our soldiers doing counterinsurgency then. The Lieutenant General Barno who was in command of our forces in 2004 said we are moving to a counterinsurgency strategy.  What Max is talking about, and he's right, that is counterinsurgency strategy to try and get the population to support you and turn in the IEDs. In southern Afghanistan where we have insurgent troops for several years now, the first marines, the first U.S. Marines went back into southern Afghanistan two and a half years ago into those parts of Hellman where we're still losing guys every day.  The success rate and the percentage of IEDs that were being turned in by the population, less than two percent.  The population is not embracing our presence.\", \"What's scary is that we've spent $27 billion building the Afghan police and the Afghan army after nine years, and we can't rely on them to protect humanitarian assistance projects.  Losing the private security for development workers there is very troubling. And it will have a severe impact on humanitarian assistance.\", \"Thanks, John.  I've been doing counterinsurgency all my adult life.  Before the wars, I was stationed in Okinawa, Japan.  We used to go and work with our counterparts in Thailand and Philippines and Indonesia who are all fighting active insurgencies.  I've been doing this. This is not the same as those insurgencies.  It's not the same as Iraq.  What we are involved in, what we're entangled in is a 30-year-old civil war that has roots that go well before the existence of al-Qaeda.  We also have to -- and again, what I just said there was al-Qaeda.  What effect are we having on al-Qaeda?  How is this making America safer? And that's the question that you need to go home with tonight.  And to be honest, you know, I'm probably the worst debater you've ever had because I really don't care who wins the debate because at the end of the night, we're all going home.  But there's a hundred thousand Marines, soldiers, sailors and airmen who are in Afghanistan who, you know, it's not theoretical to them. You know, this kid named Lieutenant Robert Kelly who was killed just yesterday.  His family is not having a hypothetical debate on these issues.  This is very real for a lot of people. And it's something that, when you go home tonight, keep in mind, and keep thinking about it, and keep talking about it.  You know the percentage of people who voted on this issue in the midterms?  Less than eight percent.  So these guys all have great books, and I encourage you to go and read their books.  And I encourage you to do your research on your own on this and to talk about it with your friends and neighbors, because, like I said, we go home tonight, there are a hundred 100,000 American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are not going home tonight, and some of them will never go home.  So just please keep that in mind.\"]\n",
      "['Manoo whizhna [spelled phonetically] means dont kill me.', \"Max said that our goal in Afghanistan is to make sure its a terrorist safe haven-free country.  In a sense, we did that.  In 2001 and 2002, we got rid of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.  So I'm not sure why we're still there.  He also said that Iraq was worse than Afghanistan during the civil war.  That's true.  And Iraq is still worse than Afghanistan today.  So where is our success in Iraq?  You have more civilians being killed in Iraq today than you do in Afghanistan today.  This is after the surge.  Now, people like to forget about Iraq, and the media has certainly forgotten about it.  But I think we can't understand what's happening in Afghanistan and what the Americans think they're doing in Afghanistan without understanding what really happened in Iraq.  The surge is this narrative that things were going badly. You have the 2006 Samarra shrine incident where the shrine was blown up, the civil war broke out.  And then this genius general called David Petraeus came up with a new way of fighting a war, and that solved the problem.  None of that is really true.  Robert also mentioned that Petraeus wrote the counterinsurgency manual.  That's not really true, either.  He signed his name at the bottom of it, but he actually had hundreds of other people involved in the process and probably corrected a few spelling mistakes.  But you have all kind of academics and officers involved in that process. Now, the civil war in Iraq, the people that won the civil war weren't the American forces. It was Black and Decker.  What do I mean by that, whenever you find a corpse in Iraq that was beheaded, you knew it was killed by a Sunni militiaman.  If you find the corpse with Black and Decker power drill marks in it, Shia militiamen killed it.  And what defeated the Sunni insurgency in Iraq was not the American surge.  It was Shia Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 militiamen in collaboration with the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army who brutally crushed the Sunni population, Not just with power drills, but also with executions and rape with full knowledge of the Americans. There was a Shia colonel in west Baghdad called Sabah [spelled phonetically], an army criminal who used to kidnap men, Sunni men, and then force their wives to have sex with them in order to release these men.  Beginning in 2006, this was about six months before Petraeus came into Iraq, I began to meet Iraqi resistance leaders in Baghdad, in Syria, in Jordan.  And suddenly, they were saying, We lost, we lost.  And why did they lose? Because the Shia had depopulated Sunni areas brutally, a sort of brutality that the Americans could never use.  So we were killing innocent civilians but not in these rates. At the same time, you had a total separation of Sunni and Shia civilians thanks to the civil war.  One side won the civil war, the Shias, one side lost, the Sunnis.  And Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad became, very often, virtual ghost towns.  This is all six months before the surge started. And I was just in Iraq about a month ago. I was at Diyala province, where in July 2007, seven months after the surge began, hundreds of villages were destroyed.  Al-Qaeda guys would come in there and total [unintelligible] the village, blow up all the houses, slaughter the men, likewise Shia militiamen were doing the same thing to Sunni villages. Seven months after the surge, violence was still peaking.  What changed, apart from the Sunni realization that they lost was the Shia cease fire.  The Shia militiamen, the Mahdi army declared a ceasefire, and violence dropped significantly after that.  At the same time, you had a government that actually had some legitimacy because they would, a year later, go after the Shia militiamen, totally destroying them as well. Now, none of the factors that helped reduce violence in Iraq to the terrible levels where they are today, still worse than Afghanistan, none of these factors even exist in Afghanistan.  First of all, the Sunnis in Iraq who dominated the insurgency, were 20 percent of the population.  And they were destroyed and brutalized and turned into refugees in Syria and Jordan and elsewhere.  The insurgency is Afghanistan is dominated by Pashtuns, 38 to 40 percent of the population, the largest group in Afghanistan. And they are not being brutalized.  The Taliban is not a Pashtun movement, but it's dominated by Pashtuns.  And they feel like they're on the rise.  They have the momentum.  They are spreading not only in Pashtun areas, but even in the north, among Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 non-Pastuns, among Tajiks and Turkmen and Uzbeks, theyre reactivating old networks from the Taliban era.  They feel like theyre doing quite well.  Likewise, Baghdad was the prize in the civil war in Iraq.  It was the dense, urban areas.  The Americans could take each neighborhood in Baghdad and build immense walls around them, and really control the population.  In Afghanistan its a rural insurgency.  We might be focusing on the cities Kandahar, Kabul, Lashkar Gah--the Russians did the same thing.  Most of the population of Afghanistan is in the villages.  The Taliban are in the villages, just like the Mujahideen in the '80s were in the villages.  We're making the same mistakes that the Russians were making, trying to control the cities and thinking that somehow we'll defeat the Mujahideen and the Taliban who are in the rural areas. Now, in Iraq, we had a government that somehow had some legitimacy.  They represented the majority of the people.  They crushed the Shia militias.  In Afghanistan -- a key element in American counterinsurgency thinking is that you have to build the capacity of the government so it can spread its power and control the population.  But in Afghanistan, the government is the problem.  It's predatory, it's corrupt.  It's lacking any credibility.  Its the best recruiter for the Taliban.  So the last thing we want to do is ally ourselves and tie ourselves to this Afghan government which is hated by most of the population. The police, when they're not doing drugs, the Afghan police are stealing from stores, are demanding taxes at checkpoints.  The Afghan army, I was with the Americans in the surge of 2009.  The Afghan army didn't show up.  They're [unintelligible] Afghan police.  This time in Kandahar, the Afghan army didn't show up again.  We've spent billions on the Afghan army.  We, as taxpayers should be upset about this. And who's fighting on our side in Kandahar today?  It's not the Afghan army.  It is Colonel Raziq from the border police, a brutal warlord who brutalized the population of Kandahar a few years ago and turned many people, such as the Noorzai clan, against the U.S. and joined the Taliban. We've gone back to the same guy, Colonel Raziq, not the army, recruited a warlord. Where is the Afghan army?  They just decided not to show up.  We don't know what happened to our billions of dollars.  So you don't have a government with any legitimacy or any prospect of legitimacy.  You don't have any sign that you're defeating the insurgency or that you're punishing the population.  In fact, there's only one counterinsurgency campaign that's ever worked in history.  That was the British in Malaya.  And why did that work?  The British basically took half a million ethnic Chinese, put them in concentration camps and took them away from their homes.  So, sure, we can do that in Afghanistan.  We could defeat the Taliban. We could massively depopulate Pashtun areas and be genocidal about it. Short of that, there's just no evidence to date that we can do anything better.  Nine years into this, every year, things have gotten worse and worse.  This year is the worst year so far.  Next year is guaranteed to be worse.  The violence is spreading.  Taliban control about 80 percent of the country right now. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.

But when you travel the countryside as I have, as many of the journalists have, you find an intense amount of resentment and hatred by people you wouldnt expect to hear it from.  Thats because of our night raids, many of our operations.  Sure, were not as brutal as the Russians were.  But were dropping bombs on weddings.  Our Special Forces are going on raids and theyre killing innocent civilians. Many innocent Afghans are dying as a result of our operations.  Our operations are disrupting normal activity.

We've driven -- Pakistan is a much more crucial country, with nuclear weapons, conflict with India.  We have driven the Taliban into Pakistan. We've driven al-Qaeda into Pakistan.  And our drone strikes now are not only pushing the Taliban and al-Qaeda into Pakistan, but further into Karachi into Sindh, Punjab.  We are destabilizing Pakistan, a much more important and dangerous country.  Just by being in Afghanistan, we're also pushing drug networks out of Afghanistan into Pakistan.  It's our presence which is threatening this crucial country, which, of course, can go into conflict with India, et cetera.\", \"First of all, there are no talks.  And Petraeus has done his best to nix those talks because he's adopting a very aggressive militaristic approach to Kandahar which isnt even counterinsurgency, it's going back to the Russian operations of '83 and '84.  But if Afghanistan is a cause in terms of a military strategy, with U.S. strategy as a very militaristic one and military focused, then, yes, there's no hope.  But if you approach it as a political problem, then there is hope and that hope involves some kind of political settlement and abandoning this increased militaristic approach, but it just depends on how you define your terms.\", 'No, but', \"If we were to pull out and al-Qaeda came back to Afghanistan, I think that would be the greatest thing because right now theyre in Pakistan where we cant actually get to them, we cant find them, theres a much great infrastructure for al-Qaeda to hide in Pakistan, dense urban areas in Karachi and other places where they can blend with the population. In Afghanistan, if they have bases, whenever you want you can pound the hell out of them.  Drop B-52 bombs on them be as brutal as you want.  I think its also important to remember, al-Qaeda is not that big of a threat.  Theyve had one success, September 11, and that's it.

In Kandahar it\\'s just going back to massive military sweeps using a warlord, not the Afghan army, a warlord who in the past has pushed people into the hands of the Taliban.

This is not the first surge, this is the fifth surge.  We keep on trying more and more of the same thing.  The generals are begging, \"Just give us a little bit more time.\"  So far theres no sign that its working. Why would you trust them?  I mean, they have a history of lying.  Petraeus in 2004 wrote a letter to the \"Washington Post\" talking about how great the Iraqi security forces were. Just a few months later they were involved in brutal attacks against the Iraqi population. Finally, if you want to defeat al-Qaeda, you have to at some point address the grievances.

We want to be this empire that supports dictatorships in Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia.\"  As a result of that, though, youre always going to have a small group of people who are going to want to seek revenge unless we change who we are at some point.']\n",

And I had nine Democratic opponents and I beat all nine. [applause]', 'John, thank you very much, and thank you for coming tonight, and Bloomberg, thank you for hosting the debate on the issues.  Ideas have consequences, and debating ideas is Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 always important for a free society.  Since the Enlightenment it has generally been accepted that limited government is the key to freedom and that freedom is the key to unleashing human potential.  Freedom has allowed ordinary people to do extraordinary things, and America is proof that freedom works. Across time and across nations the countries that were freest have tended to create more jobs, more growth, more opportunity, and more human happiness.  Within our own country states that spend less, tax less, and do a better job of providing the rule of law have tended to grow fastest, to create the most jobs, and to have the most end migration where people vote with their feet for less government and more freedom.  When economic freedom is imperiled, prosperity wanes.  And our argument tonight is pretty simple.  Our economic freedom is imperiled.  Just two years ago the national debt of our country was 40 percent of our annual production. Two years later our national debt is 60 percent of annual production and under the current budget that Congress is operating on by the end of the decade our national debt will be 90 cents out of every dollar of goods and services produced annually by America.  Interest payments on our national debt will quadruple in the next decade, and even if every assumption of the Obama budget proves valid, within 10 years it will take 40 cents out of every dollar of income taxes collected in America just to pay interest on the federal debt. If the Obama assumptions prove invalid, it could take as much as half of all income taxes collected in America in the year 2020, just to pay interest on the debt. If this is not a threat to our economic freedom, what is?  What could be?  This is big government stifling the American spirit.  But the crisis is so much greater than these frightening numbers would lead you to believe.  If you listen to Washington, this problem is easy to solve.  All youve got to do is tax rich people.  Well rich people already pay more of the taxes than at any time in American history.  And the problem is there are just not enough of them.  Our problem is if you every penny earned by every person or entity in the top one percent of the tax bracket, you couldnt deal with our deficit, much less our debt.  And its not reassuring to look at the fact that with tax rates as high as 70 percent we have never collected more than 19 percent of gross domestic product in taxes in peacetime in American history. You often hear the discussion about the top one percent as if these were rich people.  But the reality is that since 1980, when we lowered marginal tax rates, small and medium size businesses have changed the way theyre taxed from corporate entities to being taxed as individuals.  The finance committee has estimated that as much as two-thirds of all the Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 income of all the tax returns filed in the top one percent of income earners comes from partnerships, proprietorships, pass-through structures, and sub-chapter S.  In short, from small businesses filing as individuals. The policy that were told will tax John Q. Astor in reality will tax Joe Brown and Son Hardware Store, and heres the rub: in recoveries, small businesses create two-thirds of the jobs.  It is simply not feasible, given where we are in the economic cycle, to be raising taxes on small business.  The solution to excess spending is not excess taxes; its less spending.  If youre in a hole and you cant get out, the first thing you need to do is stop digging and stop digging now means stop spending.  But if we cant get our government to stop spending, how are we ever going to get them to reduce spending, to reform entitlements, to address Social Security, to address Medicare, to address Medicaid? Well let me suggest that we not give up on America and that we not give up our own confidence in the system.  Its important to remember that we overcame 10 percent unemployment, double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates, economic stagnation, malaise, self-doubt and the Soviet Union in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. [applause] It seems like an eternity ago but remember, a Republican congress worked with Bill Clinton to reform welfare and to balance the budget and to put America to work. We did it once.

Now we can avoid this future but we cant avoid it by waiting for somebody else to fix this problem. We cant avoid it by taking a poll.  Weve got to have leadership.  Weve got to explain to America what is at stake.  And I dont want to dwell on the past.  I was asked about the past versus the future but the past is the only thing we know about the future.  When Ronald Reagan became president, people sensed that we had a crisis.  We had wasted ten years of economic growth with stagnation, double digit inflation, high unemployment. And we had to make hard decisions.  America made those decisions because they believed there was a crisis.  I believe there's a crisis today.  And more importantly, I believe that Americans believe it.  But what they're waiting on is leadership to show them the alternative. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.

But you do it because you believe that you will get better if you do those things.  I believe Americans can show courage and can show sacrifice if they believe that America will be benefited in the end.  And that's what this crisis is about.\"]\n",
      "['Yes. [laughter]', 'For a price.', 'The first thing I have to do is lower this microphone a little bit.  You\\'re pretty tall, Phil, but -- and in the other sense, I\\'ll keep my comments short, if you know what I mean. Now, you told me I had to start off with a little light something or other. And I was talking to my granddaughter, Maggie Rembert, about saying something light, and I didn\\'t really know what to say.  And she said, \"Papa, you can always tell them about the invisible man who married the invisible woman.  The kids weren\\'t much to look at either.\" [laughter] Let me, if I can -- I\\'m going to stick with -- sorry.  Let me just start with -- I\\'m going to let Phil\\'s facts speak for themselves.  And I agree with them whole-heartedly on the road to prosperity.  I want to just say -- and again I want to agree with Laura that it\\'s not partisan.  It\\'s not Republican.  It\\'s not Democrat.  It\\'s not liberal.  It\\'s not conservative. It\\'s not left wing, it\\'s not right wing.  It\\'s economics.  And that\\'s where we really are.  And it\\'s really not partisan ideology.  It\\'s plain business.  And if you look at today\\'s economy - - and I do want to look at today\\'s economy -- when you look at what the government has done and is doing, I think they truly are stifling the American spirit today.  It reminds me very much of what happened in the 1930s when you got that, whenever people make decisions -- whenever people make decisions when they\\'re either panicked or drunk the consequences are rarely attractive. We have had a panic decision here in the United States, and I believe it was wrong.  I believe the government intervened dramatically when they should not have.  They should have had a brown paper bag and gotten the feelings out of them.  They should not have moved.  But they did.  We had TARP.  We had the interventions there, the stimulus packages.  They don\\'t work.  Now, what Laura is correct about is that they sure worked for the beneficiaries of the stimulus programs.  That\\'s true. The transfer recipients were stimulated, and they did spend more.  No question about it.  But the people from whom the resources were taken, they spent less.  And as we all know in economics, and if you go to the Slutsky Equations in an economy, the income effects always sum to zero, bingo. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 While the transfer recipients are stimulated, the transfer payers are de-stimulated, and there is no net stimulus from these packages purely. Now, the substitution effects aggregate.  And what has happened is we\\'ve led the huge deficits, huge tax rates, and output employment production. I mean, let me just take you through quickly what they did in the Great Depression.  I mean, 1929, we passed Smoot-Hawley Tariff, the largest tax on traded products in the world.  Then in 1930 it was signed into law, you got the crash in the markets.  1932, under a Republican president, they raised the highest marginal tax rate in the U.S., from 25 percent to 63 percent.  Now, wasn\\'t that smart?  By the way, I\\'m not mentioning any of the others, inheritance tax, the gift taxes, you know, all these other taxes, excise, et cetera. 1936, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Democrat this time, they raised the highest marginal tax rate from 63 percent to 79 percent and then on up the next year to 81 percent. You wonder why it was the longest deepest depression in U.S. history, that\\'s why.  I mean, they raised the estate tax up to 90 percent.  I mean, it\\'s amazing what happened there.  What you\\'re seeing today in the United States is an exact pattern following that. When interventionist people get going, you can\\'t stop it, and that is precisely what\\'s happening in the U.S.  In part it\\'s because of the agency problem, and the agency problem is very simply that the people in government don\\'t bear the consequences of their own actions.  They are not compensated for their success or their failures. They\\'re compensated.  It\\'s very different than what happens in the private sector.  And that\\'s why you get a misbehavior there.  Just on the stimulus, let me just try it, if something doesn\\'t work in a two-person economy, it\\'s not good economics.  Take two farmers, that\\'s the whole world.  If one of those farmers gets unemployment benefits, guess who pays for it? The other farmer.  You know, it is -- there is no tooth fairy in government. There is no -- you know, there is no Father Christmas working on the Treasury staff.  My colleague, Milton Friedman, was correct when he said, \"There ain\\'t no such thing as a free lunch.\"  If you look at tax rates on the upper income groups, anyone who looks at these data from the statistics of income, these people know how to get around taxes.  If you raise their tax rates, they shift their income, they shift the location of their income, they shift the timing of their income, they shift the volume of their income, and they pay less in taxes.  The only group that consistently pays less when you raise their tax rates and more when you lower them are the top one percent of income earners.  That is literally what happens.  Again, just to finish my comments, and I\\'m going to finish my comments early if I can, John, but I don\\'t want to go way over your head on this, but if you tax people who work and you pay people who don\\'t, do I need to say the next sentence to you? [laughter] Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Help me, if you tax rich people, and you give the money to poor people, you\\'re going to get lots and lots of poor people and no rich people.  The dream in America has always been to make the poor rich, not to make the rich -- the rich poor.  I mean, if I can quote John F. Kennedy here, and I\\'m a Kennedy Democrat from the \\'60s, I\\'ve worked with Democrats as much or more -- I mean, I started with Phil Gramm, can you believe that?  When he was a Democrat. [laughter] But, you know, Kennedy put it beautifully when he said, \"The best form of welfare is still a good high paying job.\"  I mean, Benjamin Hooks I thought did it wonderfully when he said that Blacks are hired last, and they\\'re fired first.  The only way we\\'re ever going to get jobs and keep them is there\\'s so darn many jobs around they got to hire us.\"  I want to tell you very seriously, there is only one solution to the economic problem that we\\'re facing, that\\'s economic growth, and to get that economic growth you\\'ve got to realign incentives both in government and in the private sector to make sure that you produce the way you should in this country. And with that I\\'d like to say thank you to the groups that are putting on this debate. You guys are all wonderful.  Thank you. [applause]', \"Yeah.  I'll try to get to the evidence.  Let's take Bill Clinton.  And Laura, I think you did a great job with Bill Clinton.  And I voted for Bill Clinton twice, and God knows I didn't vote in that party's primary.  So I voted for him twice, and I thought he was a great president.  Little bit of a problem as a person.  But he was a great president. But he pushed NAFTA through Congress against his own party, against the unions.  I thought that was just wonderful.  I took my hat off to him there. As some of you know, he got rid of the retirement test on Social Security.  If you were between the ages of 65 and 72, every dollar you earned in Social Security -- is earned, you lost 50 cents in Social Security benefits.  Clinton got rid of that.  If you look at it, Clinton reappointed Reagan's Fed chairman twice, brought the long-term bond yield way, Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 way down.  I thought that was spectacular.  If you look at what Clinton did, he passed welfare reform, signed into law welfare reform, that you actually have to look for a job to get welfare.  Now, there's a concept.  Clinton also had the biggest capital gains tax cut in our nation's history.  If you know, he exempted -- got rid of all capital gains taxes on owner-occupied homes, couples and -- I mean virtually all.  If you look at Clinton, the one thing I really like most of all about Bill Clinton is he cut government spending as a share of GDP by the largest amount of any American president ever.  In fact, it was he cut it by four times -- by as much as the next four best presidents combined.  There is a supply side president, in my view.  Yes, he did raise tax rates on the -- [unintelligible]. He did raise tax rates.  That was the one mistake he made.  But all the rest were great. [laughter]\", \"Yeah, first I'd like to ask Nouriel not to quote me when it's incorrect.  I never thought the Clinton tax increases would lead to a recession, depression.  Never wrote it, never said it. I was a huge fan of Bill Clintons overall economic package.  I didnt think those rates were the right things to do but I didnt.  And I would agree with Laura.  I mean, come on. Lets go back to the Clinton era.  If you could bring government spending down to the Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 share of GDP to where it was under Clinton, I think Id take that along with the other ones going there. Id love to see freer trade.  I mean you really cant have a prosperous economy, people. You cant when the governments way overspending, when its raising tax rates, when its printing too much money, when its over-regulating the private sector and when its restricting the free-flow of goods and services.\", 'Of course.', 'Of course.', 'Let me go first with this.  When we talk -- you know, the question you asked Laura which I think is the right question about taxes.  I mean, what Id do is what Jerry Brown did about taxes when he ran for president in 1992.  Id get rid of all federal taxes except for sin taxes, and have two flat-rate taxes, one on business net sales and one on personal and adjusted gross income.  If you did that, you could have Jerry Brown flat tax of 13 percent. Now if I remember correctly Jerry was not a right-wing Republican.  Did I miss that somewhere? [laughter]', 'But I did all of Jerrys tax -- first place, make the tax codes efficient so you dont have all the loop holes and everything to get around them.  Dont make it so that Warren Buffet -- Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 [applause] Dont make it so that Warren Buffet never pays taxes.', 'Unrealized capital gains is taxed at a zero rate.  I mean, thats why these things -- make it so its a flat tax on all income period.  Then you get the growth or you will get the revenue gains, Nouriel.  Frankly, you really will get them.', 'Well then you go to the spending side and I would put it on a balanced budget and vote for if youre going to have more spending, youve got to vote to debit tax rates, go step in step.  You cant do it separately.  And if people want more taxes and more government, once you get an efficient system, god bless them, its their country.  But my view is Id rather see it go the other way.  I think the other way would be better but its their country and they deserve it. I mean, people deserve the governments they get and thats for sure.  But it isnt just let it go at all times and Nouriel, I thought, in the debate at least when you were introduced, was that you won the debate last time you were here, Nouriel, by saying it was Washingtons fault, not Wall Streets fault.', 'Neither do I.', 'Let me just carry Nouriels comments a little further and I do agree with him on that. Is when you look at a firms decision to hire a worker, that firm that makes its decision based upon the gross wages paid to the worker.  The marginal product they have to get out of that worker has to cover the gross wages paid, inclusive of all costs.  When you Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 look at a workers decision to work, they look at net wages received.  They couldnt care less how much the firm pays.  They care how much they get net.  And theres a wedge driven between wages paid and wages received, one on the demand curve and one on the supply curve of labor.  What youve got to do is reduce that wedge to make it more attractive for firms to hire workers and more attractive for workers to work.  One way of doing that is Nouriels comment here to lower the payroll taxes.  That would work very well.  Where I do disagree with him totally is on raising tax rates on the rich who are the people who do the employment. Let me tell you, these guys dont employ workers for altruistic reasons.  They employ the workers to get an after-tax profit of their own.  And if you make it discouraging for them to employ workers, theyre not going to employ them.  These people are the decision makers and thats what youve really got to worry about.  Its not an equity argument of whether the rich can afford it or not.  Its whether theyll disemploy people or not.  Just look at their behavior.  Thats what youve got to do. But hes right.  Its the wedge between the wages paid and wages received and that is the key to bringing employment back.  Everything were not doing today.', 'No.  I thought the program was fine.', '[unintelligible] the government doing that.', \"That is the problem with government.  Nouriel just said it right.  Nouriel, let me just so -- you said it right.  The government shouldn't bail these guys out.  They shouldn't bail out the housing industry.  They shouldn't bail out any of these guys. [applause] The only bail outs you should do are for individuals --\", \"-- who are unemployed or can't help themselves for a time period.  But it shouldn't be 99 weeks.  That doesn't make any sense. It just makes it so it's not worth the working.  And by the way, Laura, one factual thing.  I did support Bill Clinton, and I thought he was a great president from that standpoint.  I did not agree with that tax increase.  Please don't put that on me.  I thought he did lots of Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 other things that way overwhelmed that.\", 'But that was one thing I did not support.', 'Who owns Fannie and Freddie?', \"If I can just start off by looking at the issue at hand here today, is big government stifling the American spirit?  I think that at least three if not all four of us agree that that is the case.  I mean, I look at Nouriel Roubini, what he's been saying, and it's been exactly what we've been saying.  Laura has been talking about the defense budgets and all of that. That is big government.  Should we be in Iraq?  Should we be in Afghanistan?  That's a big government intervention, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  Should we socialize all the -- no, but I -- hold that.  Should we socialize all the losses for these companies?  Absolutely not.  But you can't have a profit and loss system without losses. For people who overborrowed on their income, for banks that were undercapitalized, if they made a play, and it's wrong, let them lose. Just let it go and let the system work and go. Government is way too big.  Should we invest in a flat rate tax where the government's not meddling in every single person?  Yes, we should.  We should do all of that. Government is way too big, and it is stifling the American spirit as these two and the two of us all agree.  If I can -- [laughter] You know, I think Phil Gramm, a little story is the correct story.  I think his facts are great, but I think you can't have more people sitting in the wagon than you have pulling it.  I used to tell my students that if I ran this class like your government runs your country, what I'd do is I'd flunk all the A students out, and I'd give all the F students scholarships. [laughter] So before you laugh, think about it for a second before you laugh.  My A students are a little bit smarter than my F students.  So once I changed the rules, my A students are able Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 to get lower grades than my F students because they don't randomly make the mistake of ever guessing a correct answer.  The distribution of grades is unchanged, period.  There's not one change.  But what have I done?  I've destroyed the entire quality of the educational process. You cannot change the distribution of income with taxes.  But you can change the volume.

      "['They had 4,800 entrants, actually.', 'I came in second.', \"Thank you. I want to express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Rosenkranz and the Intelligence Squared forum for allowing me to speak tonight alongside such well-known and far more distinguished co-panelists. This is particularly an honor for me because, lets be honest, I havent written a book, Im not a regular on national T.V. or radio. What I have is my story. I am a Muslim American woman born and raised in Toledo, Ohio by two very loving Indian Muslim parents. My sister, brother, and I were raised in a middle-class American home. We went to Mosque on Sundays, attended Sunday school classes, and prayed the community prayer with our community of Pakistanis, Lebanese, and Syrian Muslims. When I was in high school, our Mosque president was a woman, who did not wear a headscarf. And it may come as a surprise to some of you, but for the entirety of my life men and women have prayed side by side at our Mosque, and both can enter the prayer hall using the same door. My parents are both very religious people, but they express their faith in different ways. My father emphasizes the devotional, and he tends to spend his time praying and reciting the Koran, whereas my mother emphasized the more constructive approach. She uses community service and volunteering to express hers. But what they both share is fundamental Islamic principles. First and foremost, seek knowledge. They urged their children, all three of us, to question, to have critical minds, and to doubt. They wanted us Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 to engage fully with our faith and to question everything. They lived out the Koranic commandments that there is no compulsion in religion, and also that God said, in the Koran, I made you into many tribes so that you might know one another. And as such, they enrolled me and my siblings in a Hebrew day school for nine years, where we learned Hebrew, read the Torah, and prayed in a synagogue almost every morning. They always wanted us to learn about other faiths, and they always made sure that we knew the difference, though, between Islam and Judaism. But they also made sure we also respected our Jewish sisters and brothers in faith. My story is just one of 1.5 billion stories in some 57 countries. The Muslim population is one of the most diverse and eclectic in the world. We are Sunnis, we are Shias, and even in the Shia tradition there are Zaidis, Ismailis, Ismasheries [spelled phonetically]. There are numerous madhhabs, or schools of thought, and Sufi mystic orders.  Like Christians and Jews, Muslims can be observant, nonobservant, performist, humanist, secularist, extremist, mainstream, and there are even some Muslims who consider themselves culturally Muslims but are actually atheists. Now, the motion before you tonight is asking you to determine whether Islam is a religion of peace.  And at first blush, that might seem a bit tricky to decide.  After all, the Koran and the Hadith have verses in them that point to peace and justice and love.  But there are other verses that are violent, are about violence and about violence against specific people.  So how then do we reconcile these seemingly contradictory verses? How then do we decide whether Islam is a religion of peace?  The only way to answer that question is to take an honest look at the people who practice the faith and how they interpret it.  According to Gallup's ground breaking study on what a billion Muslims think, 93 percent of Muslims around the world are peaceful, mainstream Muslims.  Seven percent are what Gallup determines as politically radicalized.  And within that seven percent, there's a smaller percent that has succumbed to the use of violence.  Any percent is too much.  But we must remember that the violent minority of a minority are motivated by politics, not religion.  As Gallup concluded, what distinguishes the politically radicalized Muslims from the mainstream Muslims is their politics, not their piety. Robert Pape, a University of Chicago political scientist, further confirmed this in his book, Dying to Win, in which he came to the same conclusion, that the actions of terrorists are politically motivated, not through religion.  The Tamil Tigers, for example, which are predominantly a Hindu group, used and pioneered the use of suicide bombing, did so far secessionist reasons, not for religious goals. Our opponents would have you believe that there is a take all, no winner clash between Islam and the West, and that Muslims who try to balance their Western values and Islam arrive at a state of cognitive dissonance and are left either mute or crazy by this internal struggle. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 That distribution description doesn't resonate for me or for my family or for my friends or for my community, because those two aspects of our identity were never in conflict with each other and were never introduced to us as in conflict with each other.  I didn't realize that there were people out there who wondered whether people -- Muslims like me existed or could exist until after 9/11. Let me be clear.  There are some horrifically violent criminals out there who twist our faith to justify their hate and their violence.  But I am here to tell you they don't speak for Islam.  Mohammad Hamdani [spelled phonetically], a first responder who died on 9/11, speaks for Islam.  Hassan Askari, a Brooklyn Muslim who stepped in on the subway and saved a complete stranger who was being physically attacked because he was Jewish, he speaks for Islam.  Zainab Salbi, through her organization Women for Women International, has assisted forever a quarter of a million women across the world.  She speaks for Islam.  And the entire Muslim community of India, who, when the authorities asked them to take the militants who attacked Mumbai in 2008, said resoundingly and collectively no.  We will not let the terrorists be buried with us. The media and those who profit from the narrative of Islam versus the West are never going to tell you my story or the stories of these Muslims who constitute the vast majority of Muslims around the world.  But just because you may not hear us, it doesn't mean we're not speaking out.  And just because you may not see us on TV, it doesn't mean we don't exist.  If you vote against the motion, I would argue you're voting against the moderate voices of mainstream Islam and telling the terrorists that you agree with their version.  I urge to you vote for the motion.  Thank you.\", 'I just wanted to point out, when were talking about the Koran and saying that we cant contextualize it, thats simply not true.  That is a debate thats hot in the community amongst Muslim scholars and amongst Muslims themselves.  Were debating that very question.  Is the Koran a living document?  Much like -- its similar in comparison to the Constitution and the debates that happen around that.  The fact is scholars say that when you look at the Koran in Arabic, there can be two, three, four, five, six interpretations for every word.  Therere only certain things in the Koran that scholars agree are concrete, like the concept of God, afterlife, things like that.  But beyond that there is a wide, wide range of interpretation, which is why there is a history that not many people look at, and thats part of the problem.  That nobodys actually looked at the history of debate within Islam about every sort of aspect that can come to mind.', 'Hes not a scholar by anyones measure.', 'Thats not true.', 'Right.  Their interpretation, though.', \"It needs a renaissance.  It doesn't need a reform.  Reform in the sense -- and the reason I say that is because we have to be careful of our terminology.  If we say reform as in Reformation, we're thinking of a Christian context where you had the Protestants and Martin Luther rejecting the Catholicism and the Pope.  But the thing is in Islam, there is no Pope.  There is no centralized authority.  So there can't be a reformation in that sense. What there needs to be is a return to genuine Islamic principles which have been not studies, have not been enforced and were forgotten.  So it's not exactly that.\", \"No, that's not actually what they're -- no, that's actually incorrect.\", \"No.  They actually co-opt the language for their own political purposes.  Al-Qaeda is not calling for a return to Islam or to original Islam or anything like that.  They're actually using Islam as a cover for their political grievances.  When you look at and ask Muslims, ask 1.5 billion Muslims, when you look at the mainstream, they're 90 percent.  They're peaceful and fine.  When you look at the politically radicalized, when you ask them what Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 do they fear most?  They say Western domination and occupation.  But when you ask mainstream Muslims what they fear, they say economic issues, unemployment. There's a clear difference.  And so they are not -- what we can determine from that is it's not religion because religiosity between the two is indistinguishable, how pious they are, indistinguishable.  It's the one factor that makes the difference is what they focus on and their grievances against -- perceived grievances against the West.\", \"The perception is that for a lot of people looking at the Muslim world in Muslim majority countries is that Muslim women are somehow -- they aren't -- they're subjugated, that they don't -- to a point where they are intimidated to ask for their rights and to demand them.  But that's not the case.  I mean, when you look at all -- when you look across Muslim majority countries, if you look at Iran, for example, where there is zero gender gap in education, by the way -- men and women enjoy the same amount of education. Obviously when you're at that level of education, you're aware of what your rights are and what you are demanding.  And so in Iran and places like that, they are demanding their rights, they are pushing for them.  In places like Afghanistan or Pakistan where the gender gap is larger, that gap obviously needs to be filled.  But there are women who are pushing there as well.  It's women that are stepping up and taking the lead on this.\", 'I am. [applause]', 'I am.  But I don\\'t want to -- I absolutely am and as all women should be and all human beings should demand the rights of equality.  In fact, most Muslims want equal rights for the women in their societies, and just go to the research, go to the polls, go to the research and what it says.  When you ask men, \"Should women have equal rights?\" majority in countries surveyed in the Gallup survey said, \"Yes, they should have equal rights,\" including in Saudi Arabia.', 'Yeah.

You have different factors that contribute to the answer.  What I can say for sure, just based on looking at the studies that come out, is that the level of religiosity, the level of piety, of violent terrorists compared to mainstream Muslims is virtually there's no difference.  So it's literally when you ask them how practicing they are, how often do they attend services, things like that, it's literally the same.  So that can't be the distinguishing factor.  What we do know, as I mentioned earlier, is when you ask them -- the one big difference is when you ask them what they fear the most, and they say their perceived idea of Western domination, which is very similar to what we hear from our opposition, a perceived fear of Islamic domination.  And so when you compare that to the mainstream who just want to get a job and --\", '-- and not only practice it peacefully, but we --', \"Who are you to say who's practicing --\", \"-- their faith and who's not?\", \"It's not for you to decide.

Despite what our opposition says, I do have that right.  And basically, I look at my faith -- I'm sorry.  Who asked the question?  I look at my faith and the way I was raised with core Islamic principles, which is how my family raised me, and that I determined as an adult were correct, which is compassion and tolerance and plurality and strength and diversity, because we are a diverse population.  There are as many interpretations of Islam as there are people.  And so the other point I want to make to that is that there are clergy and clerics who do stress this.  I mean, if you look at 2005 at the Imam Message, where 200 Muslim scholars from 50 countries addressed a reemphasis of Islam's core values of compassion, mutual respect, acceptance, freedom of religion.  There is precedent for this not just for me as a layperson but from the clergy as well, to reassert these lost -- in some areas, lost values.\", 'No.', \"Thank you.  Faisal Shahzad, the underwear bomber, and the group of young men that were picked up in Pakistan, all of them were for violence and trying to attack our country and learning how to attack our country elsewhere. But the one thing that the media consistently forgets to mention or conveniently forgets to mention is who turned all of them in.  It was Muslims.  It was their families, because that is a Koranic principle, that you stand up for justice, even if it's against yourself.  And in this case, someone's son or several people's sons, the underwear bomber's father who was Nigerian and not American, did this, turned him in, and sent word to the authorities.  And a Senegalese merchant was one of the first unreported, but was one of the first people to see the Times Square attempted bomber. Our opponents have a very simplistic outlook on this -- on the world and what's currently at stake.  They see it being Islam versus the West.  But the truth is it's not.  It's between moderates and extremists of all kinds.  And I urge you to vote for the motion because the overwhelming majority of Muslims, the facts are clear, they are peaceful, they're mainstream, and they condemn violence against civilians and have no interest in terrorism, which is consistently as the woman in the audience said, are attacking Muslims, mainstream Muslims every day, brutally, and oppressing them because we don't accept their version of Islam.  I'm asking for your help for -- as other people, as people of reason and of people of a moderate voice to support us as we fight them and we are fighting them, although we don't hear it as often in the media, which focuses on violence and fear.  But the fact is, Muslims have always been fighting them.\", 'Thank you.']\n",
      "['In one sentence. [laughter]', \"You're talking about four years now.\", \"Amnesty International. Well, I'll explain that and hopefully [unintelligible].\", \"Thank you. [applause] Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Can I indulge the audience and just ask for a round of applause for Zeba's mom, she's just over there, I think she did a wonderful job. [applause] To raise your daughter to speak Hebrew in the current climate is amazing and I applaud you. So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me this opportunity.  I want to begin by just stating what this debate is not about.  This debate is not about making excuses for terrorism.  Basically my career is to challenge extremism and terrorism in the West and also in Muslim majority countries.  I've just flown right in from Pakistan where I've been building the foundations for the first nationwide social movement to challenge extremism and promote democratic values in Pakistan.  And I'm proud to announce that just today we gained our 10,000th member on Facebook.  So this debate -- [laughter] -- this debate is not about making excuses for suicide bombers even inside Israel.  We make no apologies and no excuses on this panel for terrorism, for extremism, and for people who kill innocent civilians, including inside Israel. This debate acknowledges, we, on our panel, Zeba and myself, acknowledge that Muslims do need to speak out against extremism and to challenge it, and more Muslims need to do that more actively.  We acknowledge that Muslims bear responsibility in reclaiming their faith from those -- the minority who have hijacked Islam and who have captured the public imagination in their definition of Islam.  We acknowledge that, and I am in my own person a manifestation of that effort, as is Zeba in the way she was raised. So we acknowledge that as well.  This debate, in fact, is an appeal.  Its not -- also, before I move to the fact that its an appeal, its also not a threat.  So, were not going to argue here tonight that if you dont vote for the motion, that somehow Muslims are going to rise up and attack you for insulting Islam.  [laughter] Thats not the case.  This is an appeal.  And its an appeal to your good sense and your good character and to what you know inside you.  This is not a debate for Islam at all. This is a debate for peace.  And we are not arguing for Islamic peace; were arguing for Islam to be -- with all other religions and beliefs and those that have no faith -- to be part of the effort to create peace in the world.  So this is a debate for peace.  Its a debate, and Im asking you all to vote tonight not for Islam, but to vote for peace and to help contribute the efforts of all of us around the world who are working for peace. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Because there are people like me who spent 13 years of our lives working to create hatred.  I used to believe that Islam is not a religion of peace.  In fact, I used to believe that Islam mandates war.  I used to believe and propagate across the world in more than three countries that Islam mandates war and mandates the creation of a state that will have at its heart of its foreign policy a policy to create conquest.  I called it jihad.  I believed that Islam was not a religion of peace because I adopted an ideology at 16 years old and stuck with that until my imprisonment and after I was released from prison when I was 28 years old. By that time I had established this ideology in Pakistan and in Denmark and contributed to its growth in Egypt. But I learned in prison two things.  One was what Im appealing to you today and that was when people hold out an olive branch, it does work.  People Id considered my enemy, people Id considered the enemy of my people, Amnesty International with their advocation of human rights that I believed was a tool to colonize the minds of Muslims, adopted me as a prisoner of conscience.  And by handing me that olive branch, I recognized that there was goodness in the world and there were people who, regardless of the provocation they find in the world today, are still willing to fight for peace and are still willing to redefine the debate. And thats what Im asking you to do here tonight.  Because by redefining the debate, and by insisting that they would not allow my hatred to define for them the way in which they viewed me, they changed my heart.  I went on and took that message forward and helped establish the worlds first counter-extremism think tank in the West, then went into Pakistan to establish the first nationwide counter-extremism movement in Pakistan.  And as I said, we had 10,000 supporters before wed even launched, of Muslims in Pakistan who are helping us to redefine the debate, who are not allowing the minority of extremists to hijack Islam, to monopolize its definition, and then define for us all that this should be a world of war, not just Islam as a religion of war, but as you heard from our co-panelists on the other side, all religions should be religions of war in their minds. Whether thats because they want to fight or because they dont believe in religions and they wish to challenge religions from that basis.  And so I make an appeal to all of you tonight to help us redefine this debate. And the second thing that happened to me in prison that helped me change my mind was that I had the opportunity -- I wont say good fortune because it wasnt really that -- but the opportunity to mix with some of the leading founding jihadists of the world inside an Egyptian prison, ironically built by the British.  And what I learned was that I had been extremely arrogant.  I had suffered from the failure that I saw here tonight in my respected colleagues presentation.  I had failed to contextualize history, and when I was this young and angry 24-year-old who, yes, had grievances, whod been stabbed at Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 multiple times growing up on the streets of Essex, who had been falsely arrested on a number of occasions because of racial profiling -- I was a very angry young man.  But I went to men in prison, who had been in prison since I was three years old, and then I met them at 24, and they had abandoned their previous terrorist ideologies and I had the arrogance to try and convince them that they had sold out, that they didnt understand that true Islam was a religion of war.  And they said to me, Young lad, come and sit down. Well tell you a story or two. And over the course of the four years, after having learned Arabic, after having memorized half of the Koran, after having studied the theology, though myself not being too much of a religious man, I came to the conclusion that Islam had been hijacked and abused and politicized by something that I now refer to as Islamism, the modern ideology that owes more to post World War I European fascism than it does to the traditions of Islam.  And these former jihadists, among them the assassins of Egypt's former president, Anwar Sadat, who was killed in 1981, they had come to the same conclusions. And so I appeal to all of you as my time runs out -- there is much more to say -- to vote to help us all to redefine this motion, to redefine this world, because only by refusing to accept the paradigms that we find imposed upon us can we refute change.  And that's exactly how the civil rights movement in America tackled this issue when they were faced with such situations in the past.  Thank you for your patience, and thank you for your time. [applause]\", \"So, forgive me for the assumption, Ayaan, it's a pleasure to be on the panel with you, by the way, but forgive me for the assumption, but do you speak Arabic?  Have you studied Arabic grammar?  And I'm asking for a purpose, which if you do give me the chance to explain I will, but that first of all just let me ask you that question.\", \"You may be surprised, I don't know if I speak well or not, but the reason I'm asking is that you just quoted hadith, of the prophet, and you actually really did exaggerate what he said, and I'll quote to you the exact hadith in Arabic and then translate it.  Now, what you quoted was --\", 'Well, Hadith is [unintelligible] --', '[quotes hadith in Arabic] Now, what you quoted and in the translation was, \"Kill and maim,\" and you went on and explained.  Now actually [Arabic] means \"to fight.\"  Now, I\\'m not saying that that\\'s a good Hadith.  What I\\'m saying is when we\\'re translating, let\\'s try and be accurate. And that brings me to the point, and that is that I just thought of a word to describe this, and it\\'s just come to me so thank you because I want to use it forever onwards, and that is suspended intelligence.  There\\'s a tendency when discussing Islam to suspend the tools that we have learned and studied, and that you have studied as well, that we use to analyze every other piece of scripture and literature in the world, and that is that we recognize that texts do not speak for themselves.  We recognize that when we interpret scriptures and texts and books and poetry that they are contextualized, that we have methodologies to approach them, when we\\'re reading Shakespeare, when we\\'re reading anything.  We recognize that there\\'s a way to interpret text and there are schools of thought and differences over how to approach texts. Now, if we contextualize Martin Luther, and say the Reformation was a good thing, despite the fact that he said, \"Kill and slay the peasants wherever you find them,\" when they follow Thomas Muntzer -- when he was calling for not just breaking away from the papal authority but also for rebelling against the monarchies and the dictators that they found themselves in -- Martin Luther sided with the tyrants against Muntzer, and said, \"Kill the peasants wherever you find them.\"  Despite that, I\\'m prepared to say the Reformation was a good thing.  And the reason I\\'m prepared to say that is that Martin Luther must not be judged by the standards of civilization that we, after an accumulation of thousands of years, have arrived at.  He must be judged by the standards of civilization that were around during his time.  And that\\'s how society evolves.', 'And we recognize that for every other faith and for every other piece of literature, yet when it comes to Islam somehow we want to suspend. [talking simultaneously] But we learned about that and quote the [unintelligible].', 'Sorry, I quoted Martin Luther not Chaucer.  I suppose Martin Luther does have followers-- [talking simultaneously]', 'No, thats not true.', 'I dont think thats a particularly good idea.  However, what I would say -- [laughter and applause]', 'There were many, many people in history that have done such a thing and what were talking about here is a failure to contextualize actions for the standards of their time.  And Ill come back to the point I made, because Douglas, you didnt address it, despite your protestations --', 'Let me just ask you again.  Martin Luther was a fundamentalist, wasnt he?', 'Youre missing the point.  Youre failing to judge -- [applause]', \"Ayaan, you just quoted bin Laden as a scholar.  Hassan al-Banna as a scholar.  Bin Laden, for those of you who dont know,  is an engineer, a qualified engineer.  So you don't know him.\", \"Dont know his history.  He's a qualified engineer who comes from one of the richest construction families in Saudi Arabia and was educated in the elite private schools of Switzerland and Saudi Arabia.  Hassan al-Banna that you referred to was a school teacher.  And in fact what you find common with all of the movements that you are worried about, and that I am worried about, and we're all worried about, are that they are founded by people who do not have a theological background.  Now, for all we think about Al-Azhar, and they have very conservative views, what we don't find is that Al- Azhar produces the likes of bin Laden and Hassan al-Banna, or even Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami Islam in the Indian subcontinent.  Maududi was a journalist. Sayyid Qutb, the founder of modern day Jihadism, was a literary critic who came to America on a scholarship in the 1950s to study literature.  He was not a theologian.  So coming back to the point -- Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710\", \"Please, Ayaan, don't define for the whole world who a Muslim scholar is, because actually the people you referred to were not qualified theologians.\", \"Sorry.  On Khomeini.  I acknowledge Khomeini is a trained theologian.  And the fact is he came in the '70s, Douglas.  And that proves something.  What was he so famous for? Khomeini was recognized for bringing a revolution in Shiite theology.  And what was the revolution?  Those of you who have studied this will know that the revolution was, up until him, Shiites had been avowedly religiously secular, because they believed no one had the right to rule in God's name until the Messiah came, and let them wait for that Messiah until the end of time.  Khomeini changed that and turned it on its head.  And if that proves something, it proves one thing, and that is it was not in -- it was not consistent with Islamic Shiite tradition.  What he did was a very modern revolution, influenced by his studies in Europe and influenced by modern European fascism.  He broke from tradition, and that's why it was called a revolution.  He was not a continuant of Shiite traditionalism.\", \"No, no.  No one's saying it's --\", 'Come on -- [talking simultaneously]', \"See, this comes back to what you mean by people going back to the origins.  And I refuse, as does Zeba, and as we're asking for all of you to do, is to refuse for Islam to be hijacked and monopolized by the Bin Ladens of this world who want to tell you what it means to go back to the original sources.  Now, if that was the case, then I ask you why is it that in Bangladesh, where there was a free and fair election, the Islamist party lost roundly.  They completely lost the elections.  In Pakistan, where there were recent elections, the Islamist alliance in the north that came to prominence after the occupation of Afghanistan, they completely lost all their seats.  So the Muslims in two of the most populous Muslim majority countries in the world, as like as is the case in Indonesia, whenever they have a chance to vote, they do not vote for the Islamist extremists.  And time and time again in elections across Muslim majority states, they have proven that their interpretation of Islam -- and they are the majority -- is not the interpretation of Douglas, Ayaan and bin Laden.  Now, I don't want to be in that camp. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710\", 'I want to acknowledge that there -- a lot more needs to be done and a lot more needs to be said about eliminating some of the practices that you referred to, Ayaan.  And I recognize that there are practices in Muslim majority societies across the world that are repugnant not just to a Western mind but generally to any decent rational human being.  But I\\'m going to approach this being a man, and the first man on the panel to call in on this question, I want to approach this from a slightly different angle, and that is this, that many of you in the audience are men, and if the law of average was to fall true, then you\\'d be probably around 50 percent.  Now, how many of you would be comfortable with your spouse, your wife as your boss at the same time?  And it may sound -- you know, it Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 may actually be a truism because for many people in a marriage the boss is the wife, but - - [laughter] -- the reason I\\'m asking that question is that even in times like today, many men find that uncomfortable, to be married to their boss, and yet Ayaan, who referred to these practices that were repugnant to us and said that they are sourced in Islam, the founder of Islam, the prophet, Mohammad, his boss -- his first wife was his boss.  And many people don\\'t know that.  And so what I want to demonstrate by this point is that it\\'s a complex matter. There are practices in Muslim majority societies that we need to reform, but it\\'s too simplistic to trace them back to the life of a man who lived 1,400 years ago.  And in many of these practices, what\\'s quite revolutionary for his time, and in others was like every other man during his time. The fact that he referred to -- Douglas refers to the fact that he had a bride that was underage, is something which we can now look back on and say, \"That was an awful practice,\" but just as we look back on many things the Romans did and say that was an awful practice, just as we look back on many things Martin Luther did and say that was an awful practice, but we dont judge these men by the standards that we have today.', 'But Douglas, the irony was, as you know well, the person who came out most publicly in support of those regrettable Sharia courts in the U.K. was the Archbishop of Canterbury. And we at Quilliam opposed their creation, and actually many Muslims in Britain do oppose them because it raises a question.  Islam has never had a clergy.  Its never had a pope.  And so when you try and institute Sharia courts as law, the question arises, whose Sharia do you follow?  Now thats an internal debate thats going on and raging and that I am part of in Pakistan for example, because there isnt one version of Sharia and everything youve referred to is bad.  We condemn these practices.  The fact is we cant call them -- we cant be reductionist, essentialist, simplistic, and call it Sharia because there isnt on Sharia as you well know, just as there isnt one reading of Shakespeare. [talking simultaneously] [applause]', 'Can I just add something?', \"I think just to add something, that it's -- the preponderance has a lot to do with the spread of a certain ideology that I refer to as Islamism that has arisen in the post-colonial context and that was exported to the Middle East through geopolitics.  Now, what happened was Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 that there was a need for a cause to resist against colonialism.  And Britain was a secular liberal country.  The cause of the ideology that the Arabs adopted, who were resisting initially, was Arab socialism, Baathism.  And that morphed into Islamism, which owes much of its origins to Arab socialism. And so what we find is that the spread of this ideology, pretty much like how post World War I Europe, with the identity crisis that emerged after the Weimar Republic led to the growth of fascism in Europe, with fascism in Italy, Naziism in Germany and totalitarian Stalinism in the USSR. We see the same thing playing out post empire in the Middle East.  So what it's related to is the spread of this ideology that has hijacked the minds of many young Muslims.  And yes, Muslims need to do more to challenge this ideology.  We are trying to convince them of that.  But this is a very modern phenomenon.  And I remind you, Khomeini is a modern phenomenon, and he created a revolution where he flipped Shiite theology on its head, as are the others, bin Laden, Sayyid Qutb, they are all modern phenomenon.\", 'Should have kept my mouth shut.', \"I'm not saying it's the fault of the British.  If I was going to say that, I would have joined a very successful British law firm --\", \"I'm saying to you I would have been a lawyer, and I would have gone on with my life. I'm taking responsibility for that, and I'm trying to get others to take responsibility for the growth of Islamism within Muslim mind and challenge that.  So no one's blaming the British, and no one's --\", \"So there have been many, many such fatwas or pronouncements against suicide bombings.  In many cases, they're not reported.  There does need to be more.  However, I'll give you an example of why, in some cases, there aren't more.  Now, recently, we at Quilliam publicized a fatwa by Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri against terrorism, no ifs, no buts condemnation of suicide bombing and terrorism that Douglas -- always a pleasure to speak with you on the panel -- supported and was quoted in the press as supporting Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadris fatwa against terrorism.  Now, the reason why there aren't many more such examples, though there are quite a few, is because prior to Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri issuing this fatwa, his colleague, who was also from the same way of thinking, was assassinated in Pakistan, was killed by a suicide bomber in a mosque where all the congregants who were praying were also blown to smithereens because he had the guts to simply give a sermon in that mosque condemning suicide bombings. And so this is why many people are scared, because it takes guts, I tell you, to go into Pakistan and try and challenge these extremists.  That's a country that doesn't have much rule of law.  It's a country that's struggling against the so-called Pakistani Taliban from taking over a third of their country.  And they're fighting that fight on the front lines. And there are those who are brave enough just to give a speech to condemn terrorism, and they're blown to smithereens in their mosque while praying.\", \"And surely, they're religious people.  They were praying in a mosque.  You did support that fatwa.\", 'Please explain.', \"I'm sorry.  Sorry.  Hang on.  Hang on.  How on earth -- how on earth does fear of being killed in Pakistan by a minority faction of extremists prove Islam is not a religion of peace?\", \"It takes -- no, sorry.  Sorry.  [applause] I've got to -- because really, what you just said is really quite absurd.  And I've got to clarify.  It takes one person to kill all of us here, one person in a suicide bombing.  Now, if we were scared of saying what we're saying now because of that one person, it doesn't mean all of us love war and hate peace in any way whatsoever.  It means we all fear that one person who could walk through that door with a suicide bomb jacket strapped to his chest.\", \"That's an absurd argument, Douglas.\", 'For that to be true --', 'For that to be true --', \"That's because it takes one person to get through those metal detectors and blow us up.\", \"It doesn't mean the majority of people are terrorists.\", \"I'll tell you what he's inspired by --\", \"He's inspired.  I'll you what he's inspired by -- [applause] Maajid Nawaz: Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Right.\", \"Sure.  So I [unintelligible].  He's inspired by the very same interpretation of Islam that you have.  He's not inspired by Islam.  He's inspired by your interpretation of it that is Bin Laden's interpretation of it.\", \"[unintelligible].  [applause] Maajid Nawaz: And I'm got to say one last thing.\", '[unintelligible] nothing.', \"The thing is you're not the one -- the only one on this panel, I have an al-Qaeda death threat on my head, too, because I'm saying what I'm saying. [applause] And what I am saying is that -- and I've been attacked in Pakistan physically for saying this -- what I'm saying is, enough to extremism, enough to terrorism, let's separate Islam from extremism and disempower the minority of extremists who are trying to hijack a good faith. [applause] [talking simultaneously]\", \"Well, actually, to be honest, I value a can of Diet Coke more than a hymen.  I mean, really, everything's more valuable to me than a hymen, and especially a woman.  So I really don't understand the point of your question there.  But allow me to say, however, that every Muslim questioner from the audience today is not a true Muslim.  And every one of you may be a Christian is not really a Christian.  And any of you who may be a Jew is not really a Jew, because I have the absolute monopoly of defining all three of those religions for all of you.  And, really, the passages that -- I'm saying this because of the first question.  And that is, the passages that were referred to about fight them wherever you see them.  Now, the thing is really, the founding fathers of this great country who wrote the Constitution believed in slavery and were practicing slavery. Now, does that mean that we're going to define the whole of America and its Constitution by that practice, or are we going to contextualize that practice and say that when they founded this country, slavery sand abolishing slavery was not at the forefront of their minds, but later on, it was abolished, and that's an achievement for this country.  It's not something that defines this country. And so likewise these passages, yes, they can be used, and they are used in a problematic way.  And it's our responsibility, not just as Muslims, but as decent human beings, to go out there and challenge the abuse of these passages.  But we must not forget that as if with every other document in history, it had its context, and it was abused. And now when we have gone ex post facto, we can look back to that and judge it with a very civilized standard that we've arrived at and say that was wrong.  Now, perhaps --\", 'I may be defined [unintelligible].', \"Thank you.  Right.  So I'm not going to ask you to be polite.  I would dread to think that that's why you'd vote for the motion.  In fact, what I'd like to do is give you four reasons to vote -- basically four reasons why the panel's arguments are incorrect and four reasons then to vote for the motion.  And as for the failure of the panel, I think number one is that there's a failure to contextualize.  As I've tried to say time and time again, there's a failure to contextualize history and texts and sources, and there's an intellectual suspension that occurs when discussing Islam that simply doesn't occur when discussing the Constitution or any other piece of literature or writing.  Secondly, there's a failure to disclose.  And as we've heard from the panel, both of them -- and there's nothing wrong with this, by the way -- both of them are not believers of any faith, and that's their perfect right to do so, but they've made it clear their real agenda is with all religions.  And I think we have to be honest with ourselves, that actually religions can and have historically played much good and have come to much good in the world, including the Reformation despite the fact we have to contextualize it.  Thirdly, there's a failure to nuance, and as we've heard, gross generalizations about Islam by quoting isolated passages are being made.  And fourthly there's a failure to be honest.  And that honesty is in refusing to recognize that a vast majority of Muslims where there have been democratic elections have refused to turn in the extremists, as the examples I've cited in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Now, please vote for the motion, and the reason I'd say that is reclaim Islam, don't let the minority hijack it.  Yes, even for those of you who are not Muslims, reclaim it, because it's a faith like all other faiths that does need to be redefined in current times.  Secondly, vote for peace.  This is not a vote for Islam.  It's a vote for peace.  And I'm sure all of us want peace.  And thirdly I'd say help the confused Muslims in the world, the factions, the minority, the young minds, like I was, who are confused, help them make up their minds by giving them guidance, by giving them an olive branch and voting for peace tonight. And finally, Id say that even if youre unsure, even if you think that Islam is not a religion for peace, I would ask all of you hear tonight to vote as we heard the admission from the panel, it can be a religion of peace, so vote for what youd like Islam to be. [laughter and applause] If youd like Islam to be a religion of peace, then vote for it. [applause]\"]\n",

      "['I spent the whole summer of 2006 getting what I would call a graduate degree on the CIA Interrogation and Detention Program.  I was a blank slate; I had no vested interest in what had gone on before.  I could have chosen any course of action.  At the end of the summer, I went to President Bush and said I wanted to make some modifications to the program, but as Marc has suggested, I could not in conscience, given my responsibility of the CIA to defend the republic, take this program off the table for him or for any future president. He needed this.  In conscience I could not just say make it go away.  It would have been a comfortable decision, John.  It probably would have gotten credit in some circles, but it would have been immoral.', 'Well, I think Marc and David have kind of teed up the question pretty nicely for us here. Are we a nation at war or are we not?  Should we perceive ourselves to be at war or should we not?  David said that our adversary in this thing out there, war or not, are criminals and nothing more.  But if thats the case, let me take you back almost a year to the day to the Horn of Africa, to Somalia, to American Navy SEAL, in a helicopter, a Seahawk, coming off a Navy carrier in the Indian Ocean, going after an individual named Sullah Nabhan [spelled phonetically], at the time was the leader of al-Qaeda in Somalia, al-Qaeda in the Horn of Africa. We killed him.  We landed long enough to swab up portions of his remain to get DNA evidence that we had killed him.  I wasnt in the mission, I was out of government at this time, I wasnt privy to the pre-brief.  But I know what was asked by the field commander before he got on the helicopter.  Sir, is this a kill or a capture?  And its very clear from what happened, he was told this is a kill.  No probable cause, no warrant, no court. Because we are a nation at war and Saleh Ali Nabhan was part of an opposing armed enemy force.  I became an advocate; my epiphany that we are a nation at war took place about 10 minutes after 10:00, September 11th, 2001.  It became clear to me at that point and I believe in few things more firmly than I believe in the fact that we are a nation at war.  President Obama has said we are a nation at war.  President Bush has said we are a nation at war. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 In March of 2007, I went to the German residence to give a talk to all the ambassadors to the United States from the nations of the European Union.  And Germany was in the chair of the E.U.; they were inviting these ambassadors in; they invited an American to come in and kind of be the lunchtime entertainment.  Bob Gates was there at one point, Condi Rice at another; this was my turn and I decided to say something interesting.  I decided to talk our European friends about rendition, detention and interrogation.  I had a wonderful speechwriting staff at CIA, but this was a speech that I took a personal hand at. On page two of that speech, I simply said to our European friends, let me tell you what I believe, what my agency believes, what I believe my country believes.  We are a nation at war.  We are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates. This war is global in scope and I can only fulfill my legal and moral responsibilities to the citizens of my republic by taking this fight to this enemy wherever he may be. A year ago last August, August of 2009 I was in Phoenix.  President Obama was addressing the VFW.  He said quite clearly we are at war; we are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates.  Now I know most of the American population doesnt sense they are at war.  I know that.  The American Armed Forces know that we are.  The American security establishment knows that we are.  The American intelligence community knows that we are.  You, your political processes have sent me, a career military officer, the director the CIA to war.  You have told me to defend you.  Do not take away from me the tools that I need to perform the service you demand.  At some point in our conversation tonight, there will be a discussion here about we need to uphold the rule of law.  I could not agree more.  It just matters what model of law we are committed to upholding.  Is this an issue best addressed through American criminal law or is this an issue best addressed through the laws of armed conflict?  I submit to you that its only the laws of armed conflict that will keep you safe.  This isnt theoretical for me; this was real. I had a meeting with my general counsel and his team at CIA about two years ago.  I said to the team, our enemy is opening a new front.  They are beginning to attack us, with attack in quotes, its a bit metaphorical.  They are beginning to attack us in the American legal system.  We have to best them in the legal system the way we are defeating them in the tribal region of Pakistan. And I told my lawyers, I want you to lean as far forward and the hardest as you possibly can in terms of giving information to our court system.  I want blood on the harness, you are leaning so far forward.  We worked our tails off in those judicial processes, specifically habeas corpus.  When we got a point where we could go no farther, one of the judges demanded that we provide not him, but the defendant, the name and the identity of the intelligence source we had used in order to determine that he was a member of al-Qaeda.  I know you dont live in the world I used to live in, but there is nothing that a director of CIA could do in those circumstances.  You cannot let the world know that sources who risk everything, who risk all to work for you, will have their names revealed in the American judicial process, to the individual they have identified as al-Qaeda. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 The Christmas attack is another little morality play.  It really demonstrates the fallacy of treating this as a law enforcement matter.  When Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to down an American aircraft, he was a member of al-Qaeda; he was an enemy combatant.  It was an attack mounted from outside the United States towards and in the United States.  And because of a law enforcement mentality, we sent a clean team in there.  A clean team; that is somebody in the FBI who knew nothing of what Abdulmutallab had told us.  After only 50 minutes of interrogation, every known al- Qaeda aircraft attack this country has involved multiple threats of attack: 9/11, 2006 from London, the Bojinka plot over the Pacific.  And yet after 50 minutes, our instincts were so strong to the law enforcement that we allowed him to lawyer up. Thats unconscionable.  Thats a terrible decision.  It is based upon a model that you know, hes just a criminal and we just need to make sure we get him in jail.  Thats not the objective here.  The objective is to keep you safe.', \"Michael Hayden: If you're going to debate about what constitutes appropriate interrogation methods, invite me back.  I'd be happy to come.  But that's not what this is about.  This is are these or are these not enemy combatants.  And if they are enemy combatants, do I have the right to hold them, consistent with the laws of armed conflict because they are a danger to you. The Geneva Convention doesn't require me to prove that they're a criminal.  I simply have to have reasonable belief that they're enemy combatants.\", \"No, no.  The rationale, the primary purpose is to take the enemy combatant off the battlefield.  And if you overcomplicate my taking them off the battlefield by capturing him, you will leave me with one other choice to take him off the battlefield, and that's to kill him.  Now, do you want to create that box?  If the American political process wants to create that box, the people who are left behind in the intelligence service will work in that box.  But that is a far less noble box than continuing the war as we have traditionally fought wars.  I was stunned --\", 'Wait.  One comment.', 'I was stunned that Stephen made the comment to follow American history. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 When in American history have we had habeas hearings for enemy combatants?', 'David, we both served in the Air Force and I commend you for your service but its unfair to make that --  again, if you want to talk about what was done in terms of interrogation, again, its a separate debate.  This is a legal concept.  Which of the equally valued legal systems do we want to use?  Domestic criminal law, or the laws of armed Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 conflict?  I think we have the right as a nation to use the laws of armed conflict because we were attacked by an opposing armed enemy force.  And Stephen, I have to say, you have a broad suspicion of government, and you went back to Vietnam, and Gulf of Tonkin, and I think the historical record is quite clouded whether or not the Turner Joy was fired on by North Korean patrol craft.  I dont think that there is any dispute that we were attacked in New York City and in Washington. [applause]', \"Yeah.  First of all, captain, thank you for your service.  I'm puzzled.  I understand the image of Guantanamo.  And we had serious questions inside the Bush administration about Guantanamo.  As David suggested, we took about two-thirds of the prison population out of Guantanamo, not as David suggested, because we thought they were innocent. We actually transferred them to third countries actually to kind of home of record with the assumption that they would then be held there or watched there so that they would no longer be a danger, all right?  I guess if you believe we are at war and that these are enemy combatants, we've got to put them somewhere.  I'm not wedded to Guantanamo.  I understand the image issue.  But our right to detain them, I think, is unarguable under the laws of armed conflict.  And -- Female Speaker: -- to be held for eight years without trial or with evidence against you. Michael Hayden: No.  Captain, I'm sorry.  You're the lawyer, and I'm not, all right?  But nowhere does Geneva require us to try enemy combatants.  I sat with -- in my last capacity as head of CIA, I had multiple visits from the president of the International Red Cross as we were trying to get closer to some of the things they were suggesting to us.  He never suggested we had to try anybody.  They did have -- as David knows, they have CSRTs, combatant status review tribunals, which is what happens within the military.  It is the tradition of the military to ensure through this process, due process, that the individual you have is indeed the individual you believe them to be.  I just don't understand what of this enemy is unlawful.  And the unlawful combatant or unprivileged belligerent is the new phraseology.  What does that give them rights that 6 million other prisoners of war we've held as a nation have not had?\", '[unintelligible]', \"I'll come back.\", \"I'll come back with a debate on interrogation techniques, just sign me up.  To summarize the last statement, I believe the American armed forces are competent and capable of holding enemy combatants as prisoners of war consistent with the laws of armed conflict. Discussion about that point or distraction from the basic question we have in front of us today.\", \"What's the judicial process you would use for killing the believed enemy combatant as opposed to capturing him?\", \"Again, I -- [applause] -- I'll come back and walk, if you like a debate on a different subject but as the only one on stage who has actually had the question in front of him as to whether or not it --\", \"Well, actually, no.  Let me finish, because the rubber hit the road on my car, all right? I'm the one who has to make the decision, okay?  These are not easy decisions.  There Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 are conflicting values.  There are moral responsibilities galore, okay?  No one should trivialize it, and no one should throw bumper stickers at the difficulty of the decision people like me, people like Leon Panetta, have to make, all right?  But I come back -- [applause] Michael Hayden: But I come back to the fundamental question, the American armed forces, the American intelligence community are capable of holding people, consistent with the laws of armed conflict.  I feel as if we have gone through the looking glass in the last 30 to 40 minutes as we try to take people who are armed enemy combatants -- and David did not make the straw man that Iraq is okay to capture, it's not okay to capture and keep enemy combatants in Brooklyn, okay?  What about Mali?  What about Djibouti, what about Yemen?  What about the horn of Africa?  What about Pakistan? That is where the enemy is.  That is where the enemy is mounting an attack against our citizens.  They are enemy combatants.  And as God is my judge, I will use the full authority that the law of armed conflict gives me as long as my president and my Congress has given me that authorization.\", \"It's a process.  It's a rigorous process.  I governed it while I was the director of CIA with regard to that portion of the war that CIA had responsibility for.  To be clear, just being a terrorist doesn't get much interest from us.  The authorization we have from the Congress and the authorization for the use of military force is against al-Qaeda and its affiliates. So it's not a global terrorist issue.  We are at war with a select group of terrorists. President Obama has made that clear.  The Congress has made that clear.  President Bush has made that clear.  We used same criteria to capture an individual as a terrorist Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 that we use on the battlefield to kill.  It is visual who is a terrorist.  I am responding to the political processes of the American state.  All three branches of government have said we are at war.  I'm using the full authority given to me.  I use it in the clearest conscience I have.  Are mistakes made on the battlefield?  Killing, capturing?  Of course, they are. What -- you have very good men and women working very hard to apply absolute precision to their task.  Now, I will admit that the processes of intelligence are a bit different than the processes of the judicial system.  Again, as I mentioned in the one habeas case, we had to fold our tent and admit defeat because I could not, in conscience, tell the enemy combatant who the source of our information was.  If I did that, I would quickly not have sources of information anywhere in the world.  And so we had to make a serious tradeoff. That's what I mean by putting this into a law enforcement template, rather than using a vigorous and consistent with the rule of law, law of armed conflict.\", \"Obviously there's no precise answer to the question.\", \"We do the very best we can.  And we review our data constantly.  As I mentioned, to David's point -- and hes nodding in agreement because he's familiar with the process. We have combatant status review teams even before we had the habeas process at Guantanamo.  You go over the evidence routinely.  It's required by our regulations.  It's required by the regime that's in place at Guantanamo.  I hope the audience is not demanding 100 percent certitude and 100 percent perfection before your intelligence services or your military services can act in your defense.\", \"As I predicted and somewhat feared, weve sidled into a discussion as to whether or not you are for or against the rule of law.  I warned you that that was not the issue here, that there is plenty of law with the laws of conflict to govern our behavior and the American armed forces, the American intelligence community are quite capable and competent to function within that framework.  I was taken aback a little bit by saying that the intelligence community is not accountable.  Clearly Stephen has never been in front of the Senate Select Committee or the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and to go through the openness that we share within the confines of those committees. I was struck as Stephen said the system was blinking red and I think he was alleging some sort of incompetence.  The attack still happened in the summer in September of 2001.  The attack still happened not because the intelligence was wanting -- although certainly you can always use better intelligence.  The act took place because the model we were using, the model in which we placed the intelligence which was a law enforcement model.  The difference between now and 9/11 is that we are a nation at war and we are taking the fight to the enemy.  Theres an office in CIA, most operational office that we have on our Langley campus, responsible for many of the things the current administration is taking credit for.  You walk into that office you hit a bulkhead, a Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 wall, and theres a sign there saying todays date and you walk by it, very often dont recognize it but every now and again you catch it.  It actually says todays date is September 12th, 2001.  Its been up there for over eight years.  When I was director and got in a car and drove down G.W. parkway to my home, it didn't feel like September 12th.  It felt a lot like September 10th.  That's an attitude that we adopt at our peril. Thank you. [applause]\"]\n",
      "['No, not at all.', 'Thank you, John. [Applause] Marc Thiessen: I want to thank Mr. Rosenkranz for inviting Mike Hayden and I to the only debate we could possibly win in Greenwich Village.  We just marked, as Mr. Rosenkranz said, the anniversary of September 11th, 2001.  Id like to start by asking members of the audience a question.  With a show of hands, how many of you remember exactly where you were when the attacks of September 11th happened?', 'Okay.  I want you to think back to that time.  I want you to think back to the scenes of burning rubble.  I want you to think back to the shock that you felt at the ability of the terrorists to penetrate our defenses and launch such an attack like that in our midst.  And the questions we were all asking.  Who had attacked us?  What do they want?  Were there more attacks coming?  If I had told you back then that we would go almost a decade without another terrorist attack, who would have believed me? Very few, I think, a few.  Most of thought it was going to be the first of many attacks.  I was in the Pentagon on September 11th, 2001.  I was blessed not to be not at the point of impact, but I was a few corridors down and I remember feeling the building shudder; I remember the smell of the smoke in the hallways.  And the one thing I remember very distinctly is that the alarms never went off, the evacuation alarms.  We all just sort of filed out of the building and went on out to the lawn and looked back at the broken and burning Pentagon. But in the months that followed, the alarms went off a bunch of times as false reports of impending attacks, planes that were headed our way kept coming in.  And every time, the whole building, we would all evacuate and go out on the lawn and look up at the sky, waiting for the attack that never came.  Why did that attack never come?  I would submit Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 to you there are only two possibilities.  Either the terrorists lost interest in attacking us again, or we found out what their plans were and stopped them from carrying them out. Mike Hayden and I will argue tonight that the latter is the case.  We will argue that the reason that attack did not happen is because we abandoned the law enforcement approach to terrorism that failed to stop the 1992 World Trade Center bombing, that failed to stop the attack on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, that failed to stop the attack on the USS Cole, that failed to stop the attacks of 9/11.  That we abandoned that approach and began to treat terrorists as enemy combatants and not criminals. In those early days after 9/11, we knew almost nothing about the enemy who had attacked us.  We did not know that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind of 9/11; he wasnt even on our charts.  And we didnt know who his accomplices were. And unbeknownst to us, there were two terrorist networks out there, at large, planning new attacks.  The KSM network that had planned and carried out 9/11, and the Hambali network which was a Southeast Asian terrorist that KSM had organized because he knew wed be on the lookout for Arab men. And those terror networks were in the advanced stages of planning a series of attacks including a plot to blow up high-rise apartment buildings in the United States using natural gas, a plot to repeat 9/11 in Europe by flying airplanes into Heathrow Airport in downtown London, a plot to blow up the U.S. consulate in Karachi and western residences in Karachi, an al-Qaeda cell that was developing anthrax for attacks inside the United States and a cell, the Garaba [spelled phonetically] cell, the southeast Asians who KSM had tasked to fly an airplane into the tallest building in the west coast, the Library Tower in Los Angeles.  We did not know any of this, not a word.  We didnt know who those people were, what they had planned.  And then we started capturing terrorists.  Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi Binalshibh, KSM, and they provided us information that allowed us to round up and dismantle both of those terror networks. When KSM was captured and brought into custody, he was asked about upcoming attacks.  You know what he said?  Ill tell you everything when I get to New York and see my lawyer.  Ladies and gentlemen, our opponents tonight would have granted that request.  And if we had listened to their advice, if we had told KSM you have the right to remain silent, there would be craters in the ground in Los Angeles and Karachi and London and other cities in this country because of the attack that we did not stop.  This debate is about more than Miranda rights.  The Obama administration had eliminated the CIA program, but at least theyre killing terrorists using predator drones, right? No, no, no say our opponents, thats illegal too.  The ACLU and Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit a couple weeks ago saying that because terrorists outside of Iraq and Afghanistan are criminals and not enemy combatants, we cannot kill terrorists in those areas using predator drones.  So if you believe that we should not kill terrorists using predator drones, then vote for them. The fact is that that program has killed half the al-Qaeda leadership and it is probably the only thing standing between us and another 9/11. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 One final point, our opponents are going to try to turn this into a debate on waterboarding.  Im happy to have that debate.  As John pointed out, I wrote a book defending it.  But if theyre arguing about waterboarding, theyre losing and Ill tell you why.  It is a little known fact -- how many people think Barack Obama ended waterboarding?  He didnt.  My debate partner Mike Hayden ended waterboarding. When Mike Hayden handed over the CIA program to Barack Obama, the techniques involved were the tummy slap, the facial hold, mild sleep deprivation and a diet of liquid Ensure.  Im sure the makers of liquid Ensure will be thrilled to know that their product is torture. [Laugher] Bottom line is, there is a wide area between waterboarding on one hand and telling KSM and other terrorists, you have the right to remain silent.  So you can be against waterboarding and for the proposition, that we should treat terrorists as criminals, as -- before the proposition, we should treat terrorists as enemy combatants and not criminals. So finally Id just like to ask you, keep in mind, if you would like to keep killing terrorists with predator drones, if you would like -- if you think that our first priority in the war on terror, when we capture a terrorist should be interrogating them for intelligence, not obtaining evidence for prosecution; if you want to continue the approach to counterterrorism that has prevented us from being struck again as we were on 9/11, then I ask you to vote for our position.  If you would like to eliminate all those tools, I suggest you vote for the other side and find a safe place to hide.  Thank you. [Applause]', \"The person you'd be investigating is Barack Obama, who released it.\", \"I'd like to -- I'm not a lawyer.  You have an advantage over us.  But I'd like to enter some documents into evidence, right?  The inaugural address of Barack Obama.\", 'Our nation is at war ', \"That is a true statement.

The president, the Congress, the Supreme Court and the enemy all think we're at war, and you do not.\", 'Well I will tell you something about that, Stephen mentioned American history.', 'No, Im answering his question.  Since the Revolutionary War, the United Stateshas  held over 5 million enemy combatants.  Until the war on terror, not one of them was given habeas corpus rights to petition their detention.  The Geneva Convention, which regulates the conduct of war, nowhere in there does it say that you have a right to contest your detention in a war.  My mother is here.  And my mother was a prisoner of war.  She fought in the Warsaw uprising in Poland against the Nazis.  She threw Molotov cocktails at German soldiers.  And she was taken into a prisoner of war camp in Germany that would make Guantanamo look like the Four Seasons.  And she was not given the right to petition.', 'Excuse me.  Yes.  Well this is the point.  You want to give Geneva Convention rights to terrorists.  Well you dont even want to give them Geneva Convention rights because you dont accept that its a war.  But to take the argument to argument. My mother followed the laws of war.  She was in an army that carried its weapons openly, that did not target civilians, that wore uniforms or distinctive insignia. Terrorists do none of those things; they violate all of the rules of war, and so you want to get more rights -- if I understand your position you want to get more rights to people who violate the laws of war, than rights to the people like my mother who followed the laws of war never had. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.

Glebe Rd., #710 position is that thats an enemy combatant.  And that person, when you take him into custody, the first words out of your mouth are not, you have the right to remain silent. Because this is the problem with the difference between our approaches and practice, is that they believe, because they are lawyers and this is the world they live in, that the purpose of interrogation is to obtain evidence for a criminal trial.  The criminal trial is a third order of interest for those who are involved with protecting the country.  The first job is to get intelligence to stop another terrorist attack.  So when, for example, the Christmas Day bomber is questioned for 50 minutes and then told he has the right to remain silent, youre not going to get, even if hes being incredibly cooperative, in 50 minutes you could not exhaust all the information.  But the thing is that if you were trying to -- if you take the law enforcement approach to interrogation, patience is a virtue.  You are trying to get evidence and you can take as much time as you want, build a relationship with the guy, you try to coerce them in an interview, try to co-opt them into giving you information, fool them into giving information.  If you are trying to stop a terrorist attack, patience is deadly.  This guy -- when the Christmas Day bomber was captured, he was supposed to be vaporized on that plane.  As soon as Al Qaeda found out that he was alive and in U.S. custody, they started covering his tracks.  They started shutting down e-mail addresses, they started shutting down camps where he was training, they started hiding operatives who he knows about, they started hiding safe houses and closing them down. So he takes three weeks to do -- and hes even trained in interrogation resistance -- to buy time and use the legal system in order to buy his [unintelligible] fellows on the outside time.  We need to get that information quickly.', 'But he doesnt have to answer any questions.  Once he has a lawyer, hes not going to answer any questions. Male Speaker: I will tell you there were many people who did cooperate -- Marc Thiessen: No, first of all, I will tell you who says this: Eric Holder.

My question is not whether we should treat them like enemy combatants or criminals, but whichever we decide, there are always consequences Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.

And if you take it out and extract what -- the implication this causes for those of us who are fighting these wars, who do know we are a nation at war, so in the next year as I leave for my third deployment, possibly, when I get out there, or as I'm teaching my cadets, this is the way we do things because we're America, how do I justify us giving it the moral high ground?\", 'I do want to, because I -- I thank you also for your service, but I think my answer to you is what you say is you should defend the other people in uniform who serve proudly at Guantanamo and keep this country safe.  The fact is that most of those people are asking those questions because of misstatements, mistruths and lies that have been spread about Guantanamo Bay.', \"Iraqis, people around the world because people in -- these allegations go out there and, as my old boss, Donald Rumsfeld used to say, the truth goes around the world 30 times before -- lies go around the world 30 times before troops get their boots off.  Every investigation into conduct at Guantanamo Bay has found these allegations of widespread abuse are false.  Brigadier generals Schmidt and Furlow did a careful investigation.  No, quote, no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at JCF Guantanamo.  They've made the inspector general A.T. Church, who I interviewed for my book, and who said he expected to find widespread abuse at Guantanamo said that when he investigated, conducted hundreds of interviews, interviewed detainees, interviewed everybody who had been there.  He said we can confidently state, based upon this investigation, we found nothing that would any way substantiate detainees allegations of torture or violent physical abuse at Guantanamo.  Now, I'll tell you something.  We are also hearing from the other side that people there are the poor sheep herders and goat herders who have been wrapped up and taken to Guantanamo.  The combat leadership of the Taliban today is made up of Guantanamo alumni.  Just last week in Yemen, the Yeminis arrested a Guantanamo alumnus who was joining al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula.  And the man who is one of the leaders of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who sent the Christmas day bomber is a former Guantanamo inmate.  These are dangerous, dangerous people.\", \"And even the Obama administration's review found 95 percent of the people who are there right now are either leaders or fighters for al-Qaeda and the Taliban.\", \"I think that's a shocking thing to say about Admiral Church and those people who are -- you know, people who wore our uniform with honor -- hold on, no, you talked, now let me -- [talking simultaneously]\", 'Okay, let me get a word in here, please.', \"This frequent flier program you referred to, where for someone who's moved once every four hours roughly, two to four hours, what do you think these detainees in Guantanamo do all day?

This is not torture.  There is frequent flier.  You may not like it.  But I'll tell you something, people -- interrogation, interrogation techniques, Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 even interrogation techniques under the Geneva Convention people would find shocking if you're not familiar with interrogation -- interrogation is not supposed to be pleasant. And you have in the case of some of these people who are at Guantanamo, people who are senior al-Qaeda leaders, senior Taliban leaders who have intelligence about the possibility of planned attacks against the United States and they have the responsibility to get them within the rules of law, and they did it.  And these -- investigations were conducted, they were open, and they found no evidence of widespread abuse.\", \"First of all, it's not about guilt.  You don't have to prove guilt.  These are not criminal defendants.  You have to have a reasonable belief that these people were captured in the war and that they are members of al-Qaeda or the Taliban and were conducting operations against us.  The fact is, we have detained in the War on Terror well over 100,000 people.  Only 800 made it to Guantanamo.  Only 100 made it into the CIA program.  So these are -- we're not just picking people up off the street and throwing them in Guantanamo.  Were there some people that were sent there by accident, that we made a mistake?  Our enemy doesn't wear uniforms.  They dont follow a chain of command is hard.  There's some mistakes made, absolutely, and we had a process in Guantanamo that was set up to review the evidence against them and to make sure that people who were not -- didn't belong there were sent back.  But the reality is that we got - - you know, if we -- the left always wants to get this debate onto the topic of abuse.

I would now assume that you now consider Franklin Roosevelt was a war criminal because of the military commissions for the saboteurs who were captured here are unconstitutional as well.  And on top of that, military commissions that have been held outside of the Article Three court going back to George Washington.  I assume hes not a war criminal either.  But again, youre completely focused on the criminal justice system.  I dont care if we put Khalid Sheikh Mohammed on trial or not when we capture him.

When Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured, if you were the one who was responsible for getting the information, in the case hes captured, hes killed 3000 people just down the street from here.  He admits to you that he has plans for new attacks in motion.  Does Khalid Sheikh Mohammed have the right to remain silent?', 'So youre saying -- lets say we captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed before the 9/11 attacks.  Put aside the litany of attacks that he had in play.  You would have allowed 9/11 to go on rather that to get him to give the information that he had.', 'Its not the indefensible.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed killed 3000 people in this country.

One of those two little terrorist networks killed 3,000 people down the street from here, 19 men with box cutters.  This is a real threat.  These people are out there every day trying to kill us.

So do you consider can a lead sheik Mohammed an enemy combatant, the master mind of 9/11, the man who commanded the operation, the operational commander of al-Qaeda?  Is he an enemy combatant, yes or no?\", 'Oh, my God.', \"I'm not denying them anything.\", \"It's not the first priority.\", 'We did get it right.  In the period in the eight years before September 11th, 2001, al- Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Qaeda killed roughly 3,500 people in a series of attacks starting with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, followed by the attack on our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, followed by the -- or the attack on the USS Cole and culminating in September 11th, 2001.  That was when we followed the law enforcement approach to interrogation. During that period of time, we prosecuted 29 people in connection with those attacks.  If you think that is an approach -- and we didn\\'t get the intelligence we needed to stop the September 11th terrorist attacks, in the period that followed we have not been hit again. So it\\'s a very stark question; do you want to go back to the approach when al-Qaeda was mounting attacks of increasingly lethality, or do you want to follow the approach that we took which has kept this country safe for almost a decade?  Our opponents are trying to wiggle out of it.  They want you to -- focus you on waterboarding and the interrogation techniques.  If they don\\'t like the techniques we used, there\\'s a wide line between waterboarding on one hand and \"You have the right to remain silent,\" lawful techniques that can be used short of that. Choose other techniques, but what their position holds, if you hold that a terrorist is a criminal and not an enemy combatant, we cannot kill them using predator drones outside of the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan.  We cannot kill them in Pakistan.  We cannot kill them in Yemen.  We cannot kill them in East Africa.  There are terrorists plotting to attack us right now that Barack Obama would not be allowed to kill.  And second, we will not be able to interrogate them effectively as we found out after the Christmas Day bomber, as we found out with the Times Square bomber.  So this is a very stark question. Do you want to go back to the approach that led to 3,500 American people getting killed and we were not able to get the intelligence to stop the attack.  Or do you want to follow the approach that kept our country safe for almost a decade.']\n",

      "['Thank you so much John, and thank you all for being here tonight.  I wanted to begin also by thanking Intelligence Squared and the Rosenkranz Foundation and Neustar for hosting this event.  This is an important issue; this is one of those issues thats being discussed here in Washington, in Congress and the White House and your views, your assessment of want the country should do with regard to the threat of cyber warfare is very important and we thank you for being here tonight.  Were going to ask you tonight to consider the proposition of whether the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated.  Keep in mind the statement of the proposition.  Were not talking about cyber attack, cyber concerns, cyber worry, or not being able to boot up your email.  This is a debate about cyber war and how serious that threat is.  Id like to share with you a few statements that I uncovered as I was preparing for this debate.  One of the leading experts on cyber war said, Digital Pearl Harbors are happening every day.  The person who has been named to head the U.S. cyber command, the current director of the National Security Agency said U.S. military networks are seeing hundreds of thousands of probes a day.  And one of our opponents in the debate tonight has compared the threat of cyber warfare with nuclear war.  Now Bruce and I are going to try to explain to you why it is that we believe that these statements overstate the problem.  We are certainly aware of the full range of risks to the Internet and there are many different actors out there.  Some of them with criminal intent, some of them are spies; some of them are just curious. We used to call them hackers in the good ole days.  All of them pose various types of threat to the Internet as we know it, but if we reduce all of these threats to the catch-all of cyber war, I am concerned that it will take our country in a direction that we will very much regret.  But tonight we are not only going to try to persuade you that the threat of cyber war has in fact been grossly exaggerated, we are going to try to explain to you why this has happened.  In fact, what you are hearing now about the threat of cyber war is part of a long running campaign here in Washington to move control of the Internet, the technical standards and the openness that we have enjoyed away from its current model to one that would give the intelligence community and the National Security Agency much greater authority to decide what people may or may not do on the Internet.  And that effort has been underway long before the stories that you will hear tonight about Russian hackers and Chinese plans to take over the Internet and even attacks launched from North Korea.  Back in the 1970s, the NSA worried about the public availability of encryption; the key security standard that today makes possible the routine transactions you engage in when you buy a book on Amazon or download a song from iTunes. NSA didn\\'t want that encryption technology widely available, and they fought against it. Fortunately, computer researchers pressed on, and encryption became widely available and provided a key technique to make possible secure online transactions. But then, in the 1980s, along came John Poindexter who would later come up with Total Information Awareness, and he worried about unsecured private computer networks -- does any of this sound familiar -- back in 1984.  And he wanted the National Security Agency to be responsible for computer security in the United States.  Fortunately, the Congress didn\\'t like that idea.  They pressed back on Mr. Poindexter and the White House, and we established open standards to safeguard network security, but this is not Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 the end of the story.  Because then again in the early 1990s, as encryption was becoming more widely available and the NSA worried that they could not intercept private communications, they said to Internet users and American business, \"You have to use a new technology that we\\'ve developed, called Clipper, the escrow key encryption standard.  Anytime you want to send a private e-mail, we need a copy of that key that you used to encrypt your communication because we want to be able to know what is contained in your private messages.\" And again, Congress pushed back and Internet users pushed back, and the Clipper chip proposal put forward by the NSA in the early 1990s was rejected.  The story continues.  After 9-11, NSA was there again arguing for control of the Internet to try to protect our nation against terror attacks.  Now, don\\'t misunderstand our argument tonight.  We are aware of these threats, and we are not going to try to persuade you that there are not threats out there that are serious and real and that we should ignore.  That is not our argument.  Our argument is that we have to be very careful about allowing a single, secret, unaccountable government agency, which has been fighting for 25 years to take control of Internet security, to become the dominant authority for the Internet, which is what will happen if you accept the proposition that the threat of cyber war has not been grossly exaggerated. So, we urge you this evening not only to side with our side, to agree that this threat has been exaggerated, but also to understand why it has been exaggerated.  There are agencies in Washington that want very much to know what\\'s in your e-mail.  They want to know when you log online.  They want to be able to build big databases and detect patters.  And this is the threat that Bruce and I will try to respond to.  Thank you. [applause]', 'Right.', \"Yeah, I don't think it works.  And I think the point that Bruce was driving at is, look, when we talk about war, war, we're talking about one nation state going after another nation state with the intent to decimate its economy, you know, overrun its land, you know, threaten its people.  That's what war is about.  And in Washington, even when we're at war, we're reluctant to say we're at war.  So we use this word, you know, very, very carefully.  And if I could have just one more moment, I'm actually a little bit surprised by some of Mike McConnell's earlier comments about the role of the NSA in all of this.  He seemed surprised that I was talking about the NSA in my opening remarks and the context of this debate.  But this debate is entirely about the role of NSA.  And the Congress knows this because it was the NSA director who recently went before the Congress to be nominated as the head of US cyber command.  This person is now Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 responsible for coordinating the military response for the United States in the area of cyber security.  It didn't have to be the NSA.  It could have been the Department of Homeland Security.  It could have been the commerce department.  It could have been -- well, stay with me on this, will you?  It's an option, right? It's an option.  But there is an obvious reason.  You know, and all of Mike's family and friends who are here tonight siding with him understand what I'm talking about.  This argument for cyber war is an argument for the Department of Defense for the National Security Agency to take the lead on cyber security in the United States.  And this is a debate we've had now for 25 years.  And what I tried to do in my opening statement was to remind all you folks what our experience with that has been.  It's the experience of clipper.  It's the experience of classified responses.\", 'You got it. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710', 'Oh, my God. [laughter]', 'Does the phrase warrantless wiretapping\" mean anything this evening? [applause] Mark Rotenberg: I mean, come on, Mike, let\\'s be serious.  The past administration violated the U.S. Constitution and you pushed for -- Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 [talking simultaneously]', '-- that no one would be held accountable.', \"That's an incredible statement. [laughter]\", \"But we should go to that debate.  That's what this debate is. [laughter]\", 'Notice that --', \"Okay.  So let me clarify.  Tonight's debate topics not whether or not Marc's scared, okay? [laughter] Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 Marc Rotenberg: We're not going to go there.  We're having a policy discussion, a very important policy discussion.  And I'm still having a little difficulty following what Mike McConnell is saying.  He said the NSA is not interested.  They're not going to get involved, not a big deal.  A couple months ago, in The Washington Post, he's writing we need to develop an early warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions, locate the source of attacks.  And we must be able to do this in milliseconds.  And then you say we need to reengineer the internet to make attribution, geo location, intelligence analysis and impact assessment, the result more manageable.  This is exactly --\", \"Yes, but here's the point about it, okay?  And this is why this is a very important question. If the goal were to promote security, reliability, stability the way we talked in the internet community about responding to security threats, we would have unclassified programs. We'd be doing education and training.  We'd be responding to user concerns.  But that's not the model that we're moving forward now.  In fact the model that Mike just described a moment ago, the CNCI is a classified document prepared by President Bush.  He was there at White House meeting in 2008.  We're still trying to get public disclosure of that document because right now we have a secret cyber security policy.  We can't even talk about it.  I mean, we can imagine what's in it, but we don't even know what the document says.  Mike knows what the document says, but we don't.\", 'No, not the original document.', \"No, no, no.  Don't say that.\", \"Excellent question. [applause] Marc Rotenberg: So part of the argument on our side has been the need for openness.  We believe that the most robust cyber security strategy is one that's based on openness and transparency. You know something?  That's also been the key to the growth of the internet.  We don't think there should be classified documents.  We don't think there should be secret standards.  We don't think there should be secret agreements between companies like Google and the NSA over how to set cyber security standards for the users of services. Just to take that step in this area, we think in the long term would provide great benefit for cyber security. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710\", \"I just want to restate a point that Bruce made early year, which I think goes directly to your question.  If you have a threat of cyber war, you have to believe that there's a threat of war.  And you have to believe that one country is prepared to destabilize another country, is prepared to see its economy diminish, its trade impacted and whatever diplomatic consequences can follow from that.  That's a really big deal. And in our modern world, it seems increasingly unlikely that countries, even countries that don't necessarily get along, are willing to take that risk.  So I think this key point about the relationship between the likelihood of cyber war and the likelihood of war can't really lose sight of it.\", \"Okay.  So we've tried to persuade you this evening that this threat of cyber war, key term, has been grossly exaggerated.  And I wanted to say that Mike McConnell and I have debated these issues for many years.  And I suspect we will continue to debate them on into the future because we know, on both sides, that there are consequences that flow from how you judge the proposition tonight, whether the military plays a greater role in Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 cyber security, whether internet users are required to identify themselves, whether government agencies are allowed to conduct routine surveillance of communications within the United States. All of those consequences are on the table, depending on what you conclude regarding our debate.  But there's something about the debate tonight which actually surprises me a little bit.  And that's the fact that Jonathan Zittrain is sitting at that table and not our table. And the reason I make this argument is because Jonathan has written very persuasively about the generativity nature of the open internet.  And he has educated us about the value of the decentralized distributed model that has made possible companies like E-bay and Google and services like Wikipedia, and on the story goes.  Jonathan, I can promise you that none of this would have ever happened if the NSA had won the clipper chip debate back in the 1990s.  And I'm going to urge you, along with the rest of you, to come over to our side.  I'll get a chair for you here.  We've got a couple chairs, don't we?  We'd love to have you on our side because if you value an open internet, if you believe that innovation and security, just like innovation and commerce, is based on the open competition of ideas, then you have to support our side.  You have to support the pro position in this debate.\"]\n",
      "[\"Actually, I think it's an East Coast crypto thing.\", 'So, we\\'re here today to debate the motion that the threat of cyber war is grossly exaggerated.  And I also, in preparing, read a book full of articles and have some choice quotes.  Mike McConnell said in an op-ed in the Washington Post in February of this year that the United States is fighting a cyber war today and we\\'re losing.  So, cyber war is going on right now in our country.  Amit Yoran, who did cyber policy, cyber security under Bush, I believe, said that cyber 9/11 has happened over the past 10 years, but it\\'s happened so slowly that we don\\'t see it.  So, 9/11, you know, thousands of people dead, billions of dollars of damage, has happened, and we just didn\\'t notice it like the cyber war we\\'re currently losing.  In 2007, Germany -- and it\\'s a great -- this is a great newspaper headline -- \"Germany attacks China for starting the cyber war.\" This is actually great because when Germany attacks China, they are attacking them by yelling at them because China started a cyber war.  Another headline, same incident: \"China declares war on western search sites.\" You can actually declare cyber war on search engines.  I don\\'t know if you knew that.  An article from an Australian magazine, The Independent, February of this year: \"Hackers declare cyber war on Australia.\" So, cyber war is so easy, even kids can do it. [laughter] Bruce Schneier: This year, London Times, March of this year: \"Cyber war declared as China hunts for the West\\'s intelligence secrets.\" And last year -- actually, Fourth of July last year there was a cyber war in the United States, headlines all over the place.  I have one from the Wall Street Journal: \"Cyber blitz hits U.S. and Korea.\" In this instance, there were some denial-of-service attacks against Web sites in South Korea and the United States, which happen, we think, from North Korea.  There were a bunch of congressmen actually proposing that we attack Korea in response, except we think the attacks might have come from the U.K., which would have been awkward, or, actually, from Florida, which would have been really awkward. [laughter] Bruce Schneier: Okay, so this is silly, right? I mean, when we talk about cyber war in the headlines, in the rhetoric, we\\'re not talking about war.  This is a rhetorical war, right?  It\\'s the war on drugs, it\\'s the war on poverty.  It\\'s a really neat way of phrasing it to get people\\'s attention, right, and to make an interesting headline.  Now, what\\'s going on really is a blurring of the threats.  There are a lot of threats out there.  Cyber war is one, cyber crime; weve heard about cyber terrorism, cyber-hooliganism, cyber activism.  And it often can be really hard to figure out whats happening.  And just think about how we respond to these sorts of threats. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 When something happens to us, it can be the response from the FBI or from the military or from the Secret Service or from Homeland Security and it depends on whos attacking us and why.  And when we dont know whos attacking us and why, it can be very easy to call it war.  But in most cases, its not, right?  Theres a lot -- and -- I took quick notes, I probably got them wrong, some of McConnells statements, some of the quotes about, that we need to address the vulnerabilities, that the threats in cyber security have risen dramatically.  Again, were hearing -- yes these are true, there are threats, there are vulnerabilities; cyber securitys a big deal, but theyre not war threats.  Probably in the debate later, were going to go into some of the examples of cyber war.  I just mentioned Korea attacking the U.S.  A big one was in Estonia; its been called the first cyber war. And basically, someone or some country, some believe its Russia, announced a denial of service attack against a bunch of Estonia websites, so its kind of like the army marches into your country and then gets in line at the motor vehicle bureau so you cant get your drivers license renewed.  Thats sort of what that looks like.  The only person theyve ever found who they can convict of this was a 22 year old Russian living in Tallinn who was annoyed about a statue falling down.  So I mean, were now where we cant tell foreign invaders from bored kids.  The other events we talk about, China was mentioned a little bit.  I mean yes, theres a huge intelligence threat.  Chinas doing a lot of targeting against Google, against others.  Marc mentioned the enormous number of attacks per day against government networks.  That number actually is pretty reasonable for all of your computers as well. Were talking about different worms and viruses; lots of threats, again not cyber war.  So, I urge you to really think critically about what were talking about.  Metaphors matter.  If we frame this discussion as a war discussion, then what you do when theres a threat of war is you call in the military and you get military solutions.  You get lockdown; you get an enemy that needs to be subdued.  If you think about these threats in terms of crime, you get police solutions.  And as we have this debate, not just on stage, but in the country, the way we frame it, the way we talk about it; the way the headlines read, determine what sort of solutions we want, make us feel better.  And so the threat of cyber war is being grossly exaggerated and I think its being done for a reason.  This is a power grab by government.  What Mike McConnell didnt mention is that grossly exaggerating a threat of cyber war is incredibly profitable.  The last article I saw said theres about $400 million in Booz Allen contracts on cyber war.  You dont get those by saying you know, this is kind of dumb.  But, it really is.  The threats are real; the threats are serious; cyber space is not a safe place, but these are not war threats.  For the threat of cyber war to be serious means you believe the threat of war is serious.  And if youre not worried about war, [Applause] Bruce Schneier: --you cant be more worried about cyber war; that just doesnt make sense.  I guess Ill be back when its discussion time. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 [Applause]', 'I guess for cyber war, you need war.', 'So tanks would be nice.  Maybe some bombs.  Its -- one of the rhetoric we hear is a cyber Pearl Harbor, which is an opening salvo to cyber war.  Im thinking of a fleet; that would work.', \"Right, what I would need to see for cyber war; I guess I would need nation hostilities that are warlike.  I mean, I would have to be fearful of war.  I would have to be fearful that Canada would roll over into the United States.  Now if I was worried Canada would do that, I would worry about Canadas cyber command and cyber capabilities, and I would worry about the cyber threats from Canada.  As long as I feel safe against war, I just dont think the subset of war is going to bother me.  So youre talking about damage we can hardly recover from.  A lot of that happens by accident.  We saw -- it was a couple years ago, three undersea cables were cut going into Egypt.  Now, this was kind of a weird coincidence maybe, or maybe it was some kind of intelligence action. But that's a pretty big threat.  You can imagine that as a war-type threat.  And it was something that was recoverable from.  The power blackout in 2003 hit I think D.C., the northeast part of the United States, southeast part of Canada.  You know, that was a series of events.  One of them seems to have been the Blaster Worm.  I mean, the guy who wrote the worm couldn't have predicted on a bet that that would have resulted in that.\", \"But [unintelligible] cyber action.  But again, it's a war.\", \"So this is actually interesting.  As security guys, we tend to think all about the bad stuff. But, I mean, you go out in the audience, your bank account's actually fine, all right? Your identity hasn't been stolen tonight.  We talk a lot about the threats.  And in my business, we have conferences on the threats.  You write papers on the threats.  All we do is threats.  But actually most of the world works pretty well pretty much all the time.  The internet works.  The pens go to the back of the room, the beer gets passed, and life goes on.  Yes, there are vulnerabilities, but the networks, right, I mean sure -- yes, there's espionage going on.  A lot of companies keep a lot of secrets?  So, yeah, it's easy to sleep at night because we are safe.  By and large, we are safe.  Yes, there are threats.  There are common threats.  I mean, you could look at the number of -- amount of money stolen from identity theft, right, some cyber crime.  And it's a big number.  But it's a much bigger number, money that isn't stolen.  Yes, there's bad stuff going on, but it's rare. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 It's in the noise.\", \"So, we talk about this.  And actually, after -- in crypto conferences, security conferences, people get beers at the end of the night.  And we have these conversations.  And -- [laughter] Bruce Schneier: -- I mean, there's a side that --\", \"Right.  There's a side that says, well, you know, new introduction of a Microsoft operating system is indistinguishable from a big denial of service attack. [laughter] Bruce Schneier: Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 So, you know, you've got these sorts of things happening -- [applause] Bruce Schneier: We have these things happening sort of normally.  We had an AT&T satellite go out because of software updates, and a lot of people's pagers didn't work.  These sorts of things do happen.  You can do damage but we recover.  We're actually really good at recovering.  And I don't think given two weeks and a crack team, you could take down the internet.  You could make people real annoyed.  You can make -- actually probably get paid overtime -- but the techies who have to fix their computers and networks are going to have a bunch of sleepless nights, but it's not going to take down the -- it's not going to do irreparable damage to our country, to our society.  This is not an existential threat.  I mean, nothing like that; this is around the edges.\", 'I think it would be silly of anyone to think that any future war will not include a cyberspace theater, all right?  War encompasses all theaters: land, water and air space, cyberspace.  War will fill the available space.', 'Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 So yes, so if there is war, there will be a cyber component.  Georgias interesting.  So Georgia was an actual tanks rolling in invasion and there were some website deface -- non-service attacks.  We dont actually know who did that.  You know a lot of what were talking about, we talk about cyber wars, are kids playing politics.  And you see it. You see Israel and Palestine, you saw U.S. and China, you know, when the U.S. spy plane had to land in China a bunch of years ago.  I saw India-Pakistan when the sort of nuclear tests were going on.  I mean, you see this all the time that its cyber-activism, its kids playing politics and we actually dont know.  Its sort of odd to think that as youre rolling in tanks youre going to make it so people cant visit some website. Theyre probably not paying attention to that right now.  But if youre someone whos rooting for your side, thats what you can do.  So, yeah, its hard to know what these things were but any future war will certainly include a cyber component.', 'Right.  I mean, Irans an example of that, the elections in Iran.  A lot of the information came out in cyberspace.  Iranian governments trying to block it and, you know, activists around the world trying to counter that.  I mean, lots of great stuff.  Not exactly war, but they were good things.', 'The threat of him saying terrifying has been totally exaggerated.', \"You'll never get him a microphone.\", 'Do it the internet way. [laughter]', 'The voices in your head have a friends and family plan. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710', 'You said debaters right. I counted four. [laughter]', \"So I actually disagree that openness is not a remedy.  Openness is a remedy.  I mean, one of the problems we have in Internet security is secrecy, that when you have secret systems, you don't know what the vulnerabilities are, you can't assess them, you can't make intelligent buying decisions and use decisions about what to choose.  Openness actually is a remedy.  And it is a way to improve security.  The best security protocols we have in the Internet have been designed openly either by NIS, by the government, in open process, by industry through the IETF, another open process.  Protocols that are developed in secret systems in secret tend not to work well.  So basically I view security failures on the Internet as market failures; that the incentives aren't aligned for whoever has the ability to secure to do it.  And you can see that in identity theft, you can see that in viruses, that the people who can solve a problem don't have the incentive to do it.  And when you have those problems and you have market failures, government has to step in and sort of set those right.  So I actually agree with Mike that the problem is government needs to get the policy right.  We probably violently disagree on what that would look like, but that's what I want to see.  I want to see the market fails that prevent these problems, whether they're the worms, the viruses, and all the servers attacks, the Chinese hacking, from happening.  I want to see those fixed.\", \"That'll be edited out of the broadcast.\", 'So no debate that the threat of cyber espionage is real and cyber espionage happens every day.  The question is about war.  You asked about the losses due to cyber crime. Unfortunately I didnt bring my cyber crime data and theyve forbidden us to use the Internet up here so I cant get it. [laughter] Bruce Schneier: There are lots of numbers on the net and cyber crime is a very fast growing industry.  I would argue if we were up here doing that the threat of cyber crime, we tend to under- exaggerate.  We know that the federal government spends about $6 billion to $7 billion a year, unclassified, on cyber security.  Classified youd probably want to double that. Thats what most people believe but we dont actually know and they wont tell us because after that theyll have to kill us. [laughter] Bruce Schneier: Lieutenant General Alexander when he was testifying for head of cyber command said the Pentagon networks are targeted by hundreds of thousands of probes per day, whatever that means.  You do the numbers, you divide up the number of computers that they have, thats about the same number of probes that you and your corporate network are targeted by.  These are mostly automatic worms -- there are ways you can make these numbers really sound big.  Amount of data in cyber espionage?  Sure, its a lot.  A lot of times we dont know.  A lot of this stuff goes unreported --', 'Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N.  Glebe Rd., #710 So we spent a lot of time on semantics here.  I\\'m going to again read this from the Washington Post, Mike McConnell said, \"The United States is fighting a cyber war today and we are losing.\"  This is a position that exaggerates the threat.  It\\'s a valuable one, $300 million in contracts of Booz Allen this year, and -- [applause] Bruce Schneier: -- it\\'s one we see again and again.  This is not a few things, cyber war, cyber 9/11, cyber Pearl Harbor, cyber Katrina, cyber Armageddon -- every one of these words gets to be the millions or 100,000s of hits on Google.  This is not just a few headline writers making a big deal.  I mean, yes, the word \"war\" has flipped.  We don\\'t want to use it when we\\'re actually at war, and we use it all the time when we\\'re at rhetorical war.  And this might seem like a petty semantic argument, but actually this matters a lot.  All right, words matter a lot.  Words have power.  Words frame debate.  Words suggest solutions.  And words cause policy to be implemented.  We are not just discussing whether the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated, we are discussing how we are going to deal with Internet threats.  This debate has ranged all around.  We\\'ve heard about espionage.  We\\'ve heard about terrorism.  We\\'ve heard about crime.  We\\'ve heard about kids playing politics, and it\\'s all here on a panel on cyber war.  So when you think about this I urge you to vote that the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated, it\\'s been grossly exaggerated by government and industry intent on grabbing power and money.', 'Can we be on those panels?', 'If you have to stall I think Mike and I can switch sides for 10 minutes.']\n",

      "[\"I have.  I hope you won't hold it against me.\", 'I will take that as a quasi endorsement?', \"Thanks, John. [applause] Dan Senor: Thank you, John.  And thank you, Bob, for hosting this.  It's an honor to be here with Bernard-Henri Levy and General Clark and Mort Zuckerman.  One caveat before I make my presentation.  I'm not here tonight to issue a sweeping critique of every decision of President Obama's foreign policy.  In fact, there are some that I have been quite supportive of, quite publicly supportive of.  I thought it was incredibly courageous of President Obama to take on his own political base and commit to doubling down our troops in Afghanistan.  Effectively under his presence, he will have doubled our troop levels.  Maintain the commitment, the agreement in Iraq between Prime Minister Maliki and President Bush, and our presence there despite having campaigned against it, vigorously during the 2008 presidential campaign.  Nor will I issue a sweeping defense of the foreign policy decisions of President Obama's predecessor.  There were some decisions that President Bush made that I was very supportive of, and some that I have been critical of.  What I'm here to do tonight is try to focus this question along with my friend Mort here who comes at this issue, by the way, from different perspectives.  He was a supporter of -- public supporter of President Obama.  I was not.  But we both have deep concerns about America's power in world affairs today: America's status in world affairs today. And whenever there has been a prospect of American decline as we think there is today, the -- one of the shock absorbers, if you will, to prevent that decline or at least slow it down, has been an enlightened understanding among Americans about America's role in the world, about American power.  And the secret is not so -- not so secretive secret, is it's not just about American power, sort of an enlightened understanding of American power.  It's about America's part of a liberal international order, about America as a builder of a Democratic world order.  And you have seen these principles articulated, the notion that America helps to turn adversaries, whether there are autocratic regimes, totalitarian regimes, help them transition to democracies.  You've seen this throughout Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 American history.  It's a bipartisan post World War II at least, bipartisan foreign policy commitment dating back to Truman and Acheson after World War II where they articulated certain principles.  America will stand by Democratic allies around the world no matter what.  America will stand by dissidents fighting for their freedom in human rights around the world no matter what.  America will consult with its allies before it panders to its adversaries no matter what.  And America will have a defense budget and military budget, not only to defend its own borders but to back up those principles and stand by its friends.  And that is what I'm concerned about.  Because you are seeing a realignment in American foreign policy today that backs away from those principles. Those principles are not Republican principles, they're not Democratic principles.  As I said, you can look at Harry Truman, you can look at John F. Kennedy, America will bear any burden, pay any price to back up those principles.  President Clinton, who under General Clark's superb leadership in the Balkans intervened to stop genocide in the heart of central Europe, in the spirit of human rights, in the spirit of helping out allies.  And put American prestige on the line, by the way, not only American lives and resources but American prestige because he did it without U.N. support. President Clinton enlarged NATO, was willing to bring central and eastern European powers into NATO, and not let Russia's ambition for hegemony in the region hold those countries hostage.  This is the spirit you've seen throughout our foreign policy transcending party lines have been exceptions, obviously, the Carter years, part of the Kissinger years, and today.  Today it's more than just a flare-up.  Today it's a realignment in U.S. foreign policy.   You are seeing a strategic decision by this administration to basically send a message to our friends and allies around the world that they can't count on us for very good reason--the administration would argue, because we're in an effort to reach out to new quote unquote friends.  We're trying to turn over adversaries.  In so doing, we may have to compromise our historic friendships.  Look at the -- this is just not an abstract discussion.  You just look at where we are in the world today.  Iran is closer to having a nuclear bomb today than it was a year ago.  This isn't hyperbole, this is a fact. Despite pleadings from our friends and allies in moderate Sunni regimes in the Arab world and leaders in Israel.  This is a fact.  Leaders in eastern and central Europe were completely off guard when President Obama announced a unilateral revoking of our missile defense agreement in the Czech Republic in Poland just a few months ago, all in an effort to reach out to Medvedev and Putin in Russia.  Lech Walesa who personifies the appreciation and gratitude that millions of people around the world feel for America standing by the principles I spoke about earlier, said after Obama announced that decision after his administration announced that decision, he said this just shows you, you can't count on the Americans.  Lech Walesa.  Nicholas Sarkozy, the president of France, has called the president's foreign policy naive.  And in the U.K. where they talk about the symbol of a special relationship, the U.S. has had a unique relationship with the U.K. going back to Churchill and FDR, and certainly in the past 30 years that special relationship between Reagan and Thatcher, President George W. Bush and Thatcher, President George W. Bush and John Major, Clinton and Tony Blair, and President George W. Bush and Tony Blair. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 And yet an open discussion in London, the special relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. is in jeopardy.  Gordon Brown, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, had made five requests, five requests to have a one on one meeting with President Obama and couldn't get them to answer the phone.  He wanted to meet at the UN, he wanted to meet at the G 20.  Enormously embarrassing to the Brits.  And Secretary Clinton, when she was in Argentina in March, she called on the British to reopen negotiations with Argentina over the Falklands, a wound that was in the process of healing 30 years ago and she ripped that scab off.  A country -- to do this to the U.K., a country that has shed so much blood in its alliance with America and today has 10,000 troops in Afghanistan serving with us.  So I would simply say that American alliances are in major jeopardy around the world.  I think the message has been clear over the last 15 or 16 months that its a darn good time to be an adversary of America and its a pretty crummy time to be a friend and historic ally of America.  And the moment our historic alliances and friendships believe that that they cannot count on America and its fidelity to the principles of Truman and Acheson, America truly will be in decline.\", 'Yeah, I would just say that the fear of nuclear weapons getting to the hands of terrorists is not really an abstract debate.  I mean Iran, according to IAEA, according to our own intelligence community Iran will have some sort of nuclear weapon, some sort of breakout capacity very soon: two years, three years.  Thats really quick, 2015 perhaps, 2016.  We still dont have a Security Council resolution despite high approval, public opinion approval of President Obama around the world.  The Chinese wont get on board, the Russians wont get on board. centrifuges, enough to actually build a weapon. I mean, speeches and personal biography Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 and personal charisma are wonderful, theyre nice; I think people around the world like us.  I think theyre just limited commodities in foreign affairs.  Nations --', 'Nations dont make major decisions about their security because President Obama gives a nice speech.  They do whats in their interests.  So I guess I would ask either of you, show me one example, one, that has generated any benefit in response to Obamas wonderful speeches.  What have we gotten?  I mean the ultimate measure is Irans about the build a nuclear bomb so what have his speeches done to arrest that progress.', 'Because number one, that is your big get, is that Obama said that Pakistan poses a threat? One of the rationales that Bush used for going into Afghanistan is that Pakistan could follow and has its hands on nuclear weapons and those nuclear weapons could get in the wrong hands.  Your big get is that Obama basically confirmed something we all know. [Applause] Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710', 'Hamas is stronger today than it was a year ago.  Syrias announced or its been reported that Syrias sending Katyusha rockets to Lebanon to give to Hezbollah and more sophisticated weaponry than that.  I mean, Iran as I said is nowhere near slowing down their nuclear weaponization program.  Exact -- so it was a great speech; it was very moving, and it was a poetic.', 'I would say its nice, but at the end of the day, the moderates need to know that we are going to stand with them and exactly what has Barack Obama indicated in terms of what political capital and what resources America will expend to stand with these moderates? You had an opportunity in Iran.  It was a bona fide dissident movement, almost one year ago today.  They were saying, where is America?  Throughout modern histories, you know Bernard, because youve been very active on these human rights issues.  Americas leaders and American presidents have put a spotlight on dissident movements, whether it was the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa; whether it was the Soviets dissident movement in the former Soviet Union, the oxygen for these movements is America keeping a spotlight on it.  Our president was silent. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 [Applause]', 'I think the prospect of decline is real.  We are in an early stage of it.', \"And it can be arrested.  As General Clark and Bernard said -- General Clark in his opening statement said that America was in decline when Obama took over, that we were in a deep hole.  Then you're arguing that we're already in decline.  And the question is now is Obama slowing it down?  And I would say that when you have a situation where leaders around the world, allies of ours, historic allies are openly calling us naive and questioning our commitment, and our loyalty, that will spell American decline because we can't do this on our own.  And I want to ask a question.  You know, I agree with you that George W. Bush was extremely -- I'll be the first to admit, unpopular around the world.  He got much bigger crowds opposing him traveling around the world than Barack Obama gets supporting him.  But one thing President Bush did have is very deep relationships with leaders, Aznar in Spain, Harper in Canada, Howard in Australia, Blair in the U.K., Sharon in Israel.\", \"Hold on.  Hold on.  And that was an enormous mistake.  And by the way, he basically stood by Georgia when Georgia went to war with Russia because of Russia's provocation. So that was a big mistake by Bush, and I'm glad he ultimately agreed to move off that outreach to Russia.  But you look at these leaders.  Blair, Berlusconi, Howard, Harper -- these leaders stood by Bush through thick and thin, even though their populations despised him.  I ask you to -- tell me one leader today that has that kind of relationship with Obama.  One leader around the world that is so moved by his speeches and so moved by the press release he put out saying that Pakistan has terrorists in it, point one leader that is willing to stand by him and who he has a very close alliance.  Just one.\", \"Those polls don't make policy.  Governments make policy.  There is not a single government? [applause] Dan Senor: That's very nice.  They applaud for him -- [talking simultaneously] Dan Senor: Tell me one leader.  One leader.\", 'The inner Sarkozy in you.', 'Yeah, I want to be clear here.  It is clear that political leaders make decisions based on the domestic political situation.  In fact, several of the leaders I cited lost their elections because of their commitment to standing with the United States under President Bush. Two: security matters.  Probably security matters and I have a slightly less cynical view; security matters to these leaders, in many cases more than politics.  And it was because not of some personal emotional relationship that they had with President Bush.  Im sorry if my American accent, I wasnt able to make my point clear.  Their sense of loyalty to President Bush was because of his commitment to them and his commitment to the security of their country which is what they ultimately care about and his commitment to security abroad.  And those leaders were willing to go the mat even if it meant risking their political careers to stand with him.  You say Tony Blair was trapped.   To this day, Tony Blair is out of office. To this day, he defends the decisions he made.  So I come back to you, you say policy makers dont matter when it comes to policy?  I mean thats the most inverted metric Ive ever heard.  Policy makers make policy, and I dont see a single policy maker in the world today despite the millions of people who have this affection for President Obama, which I think is heartfelt; I dont see a single policy maker that is willing to stand up and go toe to toe and lock arms with this president.  And I -- I think if they believed he was committed to them, that youd have a different outcome. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710', 'It was stunning.  Ive never heard such unanimous criticism of a presidents visit to China from across the political spectrum from the left and the right in the United States.  It was a humiliating experience.  The Chinese were allowed to censor his speech on the ground. The Chinese were allowed to choose who could attend this speech.  Students as you know, many students were kept out and he left China with no concessions from the Chinese.  Normally when presidents go, even if they intend to somewhat humiliate the president, they at least give them a couple of crumbs to leave with.  We didnt get anything.  Here we are today, Iran is on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon and China still wont support sanctions on the U.N. Security Council, still wont support sanctions.  By the way they wont support sanctions in Sudan; they wont support sanctions anywhere.  So, I keep coming back to my question, what do we get?  What have we gotten for this new posture?', \"I am the first to credit the president on some of the progress in Afghanistan.  What I'm saying is it doesn't compensate for a complete realignment of U.S. foreign policy in every Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 other corner of the world.  So it is very important what you just cited about women's rights in Afghanistan.  At the same time, the government of Russia, with whom this president celebrates a reset of relationships, is engaged in a fierce political repression of again.  That's what it looks like.  Dissident leaders like Boris Nemtsov who I hosted when he came over here from Moscow about a year and a half ago, couldn't get any hearing inside the administration.  Iran, I mean, the dissident movement in Iran was basically left on their own, left hung out to dry.  And the notion of the president not putting a spotlight on them, as General Clark said, somehow would weaken the Iranian regime.  The Iranian regime blamed us and demonized us no matter what when he did.  And they were more than happy to do it even though we were silent.  And as I said, here we are a year later. The dissident movement is weaker than it was a year ago.  And Iran is closer to getting a nuclear weapon.  I think that makes the world a less stable place.  And I think it is more consistent with American decline than it is American ascendancy.  If Iran develops a nuclear weapon capability, we will have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East the likes of which we have never seen.  And this is not like a hypothetical thing.  The news reports coming out of Egypt and out of Saudi Arabia, out of Yemen of this happening.\", \"Yeah, its important, it just doesn't compensate for foreign policy framework.\", 'Look.  As I made it clear at the beginning of this talk this evening, I think President Obamas decision to support General Petraeus and General McChrystal in Afghanistan was enormously important.  I actually have deep concerns about Afghanistan right now, about the civilian/military coordination.  I think were potentially heading for a crisis on the ground in Afghanistan as it relates to civilian-military coordination.  But that said, I dont take one ounce away from the Presidents courageous decision on Afghanistan.  To me, its important but it doesnt make for a foreign policy.  Bernard, look, I have been a great admirer of yours.  Throughout your career you have advocated for human rights and the importance of standing with dissonant movements, even as a centerpiece of foreign policy.  There were about 40 individuals that signed a letter to the President on the eve of his trip to Moscow asking to meet with opposition, with democratic opposition figures in Moscow while he was there.  Only one leader from the Left in the United States signed it, the head of Amnesty International USA. And as one Left-wing blog commented, its a sad statement of the state of affairs that human rights has so been subordinated as a principle in our foreign policy that if someone from the Left wants to advocate for human rights being an important part of a presidents visit to Russia, to China, to any of these places, they have to sign a letter with a bunch of neocons like myself.  Its a sad statement of affairs, and Im amazed that you are giving him a pass.', 'Can I ask you a question?  Why didnt he give that exact speech you just gave when the dissidents were rising up in Iran? [applause]', \"Iranian regime's response -- Iranian regime's response made Tiananmen look like a day at the park.  The regime was more repressive today than it has been at any time.  The regime is stronger today than it has been --\", '-- at any time.', \"Let me finish.  And Mousavi and his leaders were calling on America.  Where is America?  Why isn't America putting a spotlight on our movement giving us the oxygen we need?  Let's take them at their word. [applause]\", \"There is a bill before Congress right now that would impose sanctions on Iran on the import of petroleum products which the Iranian economy is dependent on.  The House has passed this legislation overwhelming.  The Senate has passed it overwhelmingly legislatively, and it is in conference right now.  The administration is opposed to it.  I think that's a grave mistake.\", 'I actually -- can I -- as Mort said, it\\'s very difficult to prove as counterfactual, \"what would have happened if\" but we do know what actually happened, right?  The administration chose to be silent, and there was bloodshed in the streets of Tehran.  And the dissident leaders we hope are the future leaders of Iran, were saying where is America?  That much we know.  And we know the whole world watched that happen, where we looked impotent in the face of a major threat to the Iranian regime.  We also know that the administration was saying at the time that if we stand back and are silent, this will make it easier for the Iranians to come to the negotiating table with us on a -- disarming their nuclear capability.  That was an argument, that it\\'ll help them moderate because they won\\'t feel under siege.  They won\\'t feel under pressure, and they\\'ll come to the table.  Well, here we are, almost a year later, exactly, and the Iranians, as I said, just mastered 3,000 centrifuges.  The IAEA is basically conceding that Iran is well on its way to having a nuclear weapon.', 'I agree.', 'You know, there was an interesting development about six, eight weeks ago after the administration caused a near rupture in the U.S./Israel relationship over an insult that the administration felt it had been subjected to by the Israeli government over the settlement issue in East Jerusalem.  A week later, Secretary Clinton went to Moscow, and the purpose of that trip was to try and get the Russians to get on board on the Security Council for real sanctions against Iran.  She arrived in Moscow and everyone knew that was the purpose of her trip, and upon her arrival, the foreign minister of Russia publicly announced that Russia was resuming its building of the nuclear plant in Bushehr, Iran. Welcome to Moscow, Madam Secretary.  When a senior administration official was quoted in the Washington Post was asked, do you think that was an insult, he said absolutely not.  Now anyone who believes that by the way shouldnt be a senior administration official.  But more importantly, its a metaphor for this administrations realignment of its foreign policy, whether its in Latin America, whether its in the Arab world, whether its in Israel, whether its in eastern and Central Europe, we are sending a very consistent message and the leaders in that part of the world are no longer saying it quietly.  They are saying it publicly that they feel that America is moving away from its historic commitments to those countries.  As youve heard tonight, theres not a single policymaker or government leader, as Bernard and General Clark said, theres not a single policymaker or government leader that they can cite that is willing to stand with America today and expend real political capital to stand with America.  There is -- there are no real concessions to point to for all this outreach weve done, for all the speeches that the President has given.  As Ive said before, personal biography is nice and it is moving to win over crowds around the world.  It is not a substitute for a foreign policy, especially when your country is in decline.']\n",
      "[\"If you thought you were in pain before I spoke, wait until you see what it's going to be like after I speak. [laughter] Mort Zuckerman: Good evening.  I want to share with the other speakers the measure of being a part of this wonderful group and to speak to this audience.  Let me just say when President Obama came into office, it was really a quiet sigh of relief around the world.  He wasn't George Bush.  The expectations -- [applause] Mort Zuckerman: No, I don't mean that.  I think there was a huge concern in the world about the nature of American leadership at that point.  And the expectations about President Obama were exceedingly high.  Now, any president of the United States really inherits a great legacy. We stand at the top of the power ladder.  We are not a dominant power but we're the leading power.  We're the only power that can coordinate and coalesce groups of nations. Most countries distrust the United States less than they distrust one another.  So they look for Washington -- to Washington for leadership.  And they look for Washington to support them against regional opponents and other threats.  They know they cannot solve most of these problems without the United States.  And they need our leadership in the most severe and serious way.  Now, my sense, however, is that President Obama on this level is uncomfortable with this role for the United States.  He seems to be uncomfortable in leading a lot of other nations.  And almost feels that there is nothing special about America's role in the world.  What you have, it seems to me, is too much well intentioned belief in the power of rhetoric, good will, and too little appreciation of reality.  The former president of the Council of Foreign Relations, Les Gelb put it, there is the impression that Obama confuses speeches with policies. Now, foreign policy entails an understanding of the cultural historical and personal political circumstances of those we are dealing with.  And this is where I think we have a real problem.  Because there is, I think, a critical mass of influential people in world affairs who once held high hopes for this president and have begun to wonder whether or not they have misjudged the man.  In the Middle East they always talk about the following.  There are two chess games that are always being played in the Middle East. One is the chess board that you see on top of the table.  The other is the chess board that is below the table that nobody sees except the people who know how to play the game. And the sense that they have is that this administration does not know how to play the game and has made mistake after mistake after mistake to the point where there is really an erosion of confidence in the United States and limitation therefore on what we can accomplish.  And it also has contributed to a growing perception that Obama's management of American power is almost amateurish.  He tends to speak as a teacher rather than as a leader.  Now, in meetings with many of the leaders of the Arab world, Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 particularly the Sunni leaders, they fear an expansionist Iran proceeding with full speed ahead on a program to develop nuclear weapons on top of programs testing intermediate range missiles.  I will give you an illustration of how a major foreign leader of an Arab country put it to me.  When you remember Obama said if people extend a hand to shake our hands instead of a fist, we will shake that hand.  He says the problem with Iran is you can't deal with it by shaking their hand.  You have to deal with them by showing that your capable of exercising the fist.  And that is what -- it is that understanding and that understanding of the culture, not just in the Middle East, but in many parts of the world that is missing.  And what you have, you have the centrifuges continuing to spin in Iraq. And there is no sense, for example, when they had the uprising on the streets of Iran, that we were there with them, that we were on, as Fouad Ajami put it, on freedom's side. Now, the question is, is Iran going to be emboldened by what they see and experience as American weakness and the lack of real willpower?  Well, as long as the Arab foreign -- the Arab foreign ministers put it the following one.  One of them said -- now, this is a quote.  He said they are hopelessly naive.  The Americans are hopelessly naive.  And they -- in that part of the world, naivety is not just naivety.  It is seen as weakness as it really gives the impression that the leadership does not have the stuff that real leaders are made of.  And that is the feeling that they have about America these days.  Now, this is what French President Sarkozy was referring to.  In fairness to what we said.  Obama basically comes and gives a speech about wouldn't it be nice if the world did not have any nuclear weapons.  Yes, it would.  He basically said this is almost an alternative universe. It's as if nuclear weapons could be banished from the face of the earth.  They cannot be he said and Sarkozy pointed out, that there are two countries he said, thats in the meeting in which the president was in the audience.  He said there are two countries right in front of us doing the exact opposite, referring of course to North Korea and Iran, an Iran that had ignored five U.N. resolutions on this issue alone.  In the later diplomatic push, vis-a- vis Iran and North Korea: that yielded nothing.  Sarkozy said we are right to talk about the future as the president was referring, but we also have to worry about the present and here you have these two countries, members of the United Nations who are pursuing exactly the policies that we find inimical.  Weve got to find some way to deal with the present he said and not with the future.  In fact he pointed to the President -- looked at the President and said, this is not the real world that you are talking about; this is the virtual world. Now this is in the full presence of many leaders of the United Nations in the audience and the French President says to an American President, you have to admit that the world is upside down when the French President sounds much stronger than the American one. And this is what it seems to me is what we have to address here.  Now, it is, I can add to those things youve heard the references to when Obama withdrew the promises of ABM defenses, two countries in Central Europe, perhaps thinking that he might appease Russia into abrogating their patronage of Irans nuclear ambitions.  Well frankly this has obviously failed and now in Central Europe, there is a fear that the United States may no longer be a reliable guarantor of their security.  My time is up --\", 'Well let me just, if I may just close.  I just want to say one thing about this.  What we are talking about here is an ability to play the game and an understand of how to play to the game and play the game well and effectively.  That is what I see us lacking in the Obama administration and why it makes me feel that we are on the decline.', \"I'm going to speak with a French accent, if you don't mind. [laughter] [applause]\", \"I will quote a major Asian leader who said -- very well-known Asian leader who said in the world of Asia, in the leadership of Asia which is the leadership that runs that part of the world -- we are concerned that Obama does not have the strength to confront his enemies, and we fear that he does not have the strength to support his friends.  Now, I'm Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 not saying that there isn't an expanded role for the media in many different parts of the world.  In terms of the way political decisions and political power is exercised, I would ask you to think, if I may, do you think that the ability to speak is influencing the way political decisions are made in those parts of the world where we are trying to influence? Do we think that we are getting through to the leadership because Obama gives speeches?\", \"No, I think he is respected.  I don't think he is effective.\", \"Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Well, again, I hate to say this, but I think you're speaking only to foreign leaders who speak with a French accent.  I don't know what else to tell you.  No, that's an unfair comment. [laughter] Mort Zuckerman: Look.  Let me just say that.  The one area of the world where we have to worry about is frankly the Middle East.  And there you have, I think, a couple of countries, and a couple of movements that are really threatening a lot of our allies, Iran being one.  The movements in Hezbollah and Hamas, basically terrorist groups of that sort.  For Syria to have just provided scud missiles or their equivalent to Hezbollah is changing the whole military context of the region.  Nothing is stopping these people.  And I don't dismiss entirely the rhetoric of the president.  I'm just saying that in that part of the world you need a lot more than rhetoric.  I don't want to diminish what the value of rhetoric is.  But you have to translate that into other policies that really do have an effect against the people who are threatening.\", \"I don't disagree with that.  I mean I wasn't referring at that point -- at that point, we were in a position in Afghanistan, and there is an issue, a connection between Afghanistan and Pakistan as we all know.  If there was a rationale for going into Afghanistan, it is to make sure that Pakistan does not collapse.  Because they do have 120 or whatever the number of nuclear weapons they have, and that is the worst thing that would happen if they fall into the wrong hands. So in a sense, we are protecting Pakistan and all of that.  So I don't diminish that.  I'm not saying that everything he's done is wrong.  I'm just saying that when you play this game out there, and it is, in a sense, an understanding of how to work in that community, I'm afraid that the rhetoric that is being saluted here is not nearly as effective as you would say and the policies that would be effective are simple not being carried out.\", \"Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Well he certainly did and whats more, I think there was a wide sense within the Chinese leadership that he was weak.  This was the worst visit of any president that has been made to China and it is a critical country, whether or not they support what we want to do vis-a-vis Iran or not.  We came out of that with a greatly diminished sense of prestige or status or whatever, which are -- these are things that are very important to Chinese political culture.  And to deny that is to deny really what happened.  That was the reality of it.  You can argue why it happened.  I think it was very poor staff work on the part of the president's team.  But whatever it was, it worked out in the worst way.  They did not understand how to play the game with the Chinese.\", \"That is a very optimistic vision of what happened on Barack's visit to China.  I don't think there is a single -- I haven't seen -- and I've read most of them, maybe not all of them.  I haven't seen a single person who understands what goes on in China, who thought that was a successful visit that in fact we came out with an enhanced relationship.  Quite the opposite.  It was a diminished relationship.  I just -- you can give any interpretation you want to it, but I really cannot accept that description of what happened. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710\", \"Yes, I would say that does show that there is influence on the part of the president in terms of issues like this.  What we are also contending with, and let's be candid about it, most of the debt of these countries is in the hands of the European banks.  Were those banks to go under because they didn't work out a plan, you would have had a major economic catastrophe in Europe.  And it would have spilled over into the United States. Our own economic policies, I might say, leave something to be desired too in terms of building up deficits as far as the eye can see, that are going to really transform the economic wherewithal with which this country has been the bulwark of freedom in this world.  And it's going to be a growing problem for us.  But to have Europe collapse at this point, the United States had to put whatever influence they could to bear on these decisions.  And I am glad they did, and I'm glad it worked out because otherwise we would have had a major collapse.\", \"Yes, absolutely, I do.  I'm not -- I don't think everything the White House does is bad. Don't get me wrong on that.  But I think on this --\", '-- absolutely.', 'Well, yes, I did support --', \"Obama, yes, I'm saying that engagement is not enough to deal with the issues that we have to deal with, not in Iran, frankly, not in the Soviet Union, not with China, and not in the Middle East.  I'm not dismissing engagement.  It's just not enough.  And as I say, the view that so many of them have is that they don't think he is going to be tough enough to deal with the issues that really have to be dealt with in a tough-minded way.  I hope that Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 they are wrong and I hope that I am wrong.  But the evidence so far frankly is not encouraging, and frankly when you deal with those people, they are not encouraged.  I mean, this is not something that I'm making out of thin air.  I promise you that this is what they are saying and what they are very concerned about.  So I support engagement but engagement is one hand, the other hand is they have to -- you have to be able to deal not just with a handshake but with a clenched fist.\", \"Well, I think that's a fair question.\", \"I don't know the answer.  I don't know if anybody knows the answer.  I think one of the rationales for the restraint of the American administration was to have the Iranian government be able to divert the attention from those people who were at home objecting to their government and to their policies and blame it all on America.  And we didn't want to be the lightning rod, so to speak, for the opposition which they would have brought forth against the people who were dissenting.  I don't know -- nobody will ever know what would have worked better.  I do think that's a fair argument to make.  I don't know the answer to that question.\", \"The reference was made to the economy and to the economic condition of the United States, which I think is a critical part of everything that were talking about.  We never got a chance in terms of time to do that, but if there is one area where in my judgment we have made huge errors that are going to compound the macroeconomic problems of the United States is in fact the way we have responded to the economic crisis.  That in fairness to the extent Obama inherited, but in my judgment the policies he adopted were simply inadequate to the problem, they were wrongly focused.  There isn't a country in Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 the world that doesn't understand how serious the problems are for the United States and its economy.  And if there is one area where we had a huge reach around the world, it was in the area of the economy.  And that, I will suggest to you is the area where this administration has failed the most.  And by the way, the people who know it most clearly are the American people.  And that's why his support has dropped so dramatically.  So without going into that in any more detail because there's no time, I think that it contributes mightily to the conclusions that we would urge you to have.\"]\n",

      "['To measure the depths of my sins, Im holding up a book written by my son, Alex Avery. Its entitled The Truth about Organic Foods and it traces the history of the movement from Germany in the 1920s on to our organic farming today, and the tragedy that organic farming doesnt live up to the hype.  The people who are buying it and consuming it and offering it to their families truly want to do the best possible thing, as speakers tonight have said, and I certainly dont disagree with that.  But this is not just an unfortunate failure to live up to the billing.  It is now a serious international concern, because we are about to enter the biggest farming challenge the world has ever seen.  We will have, by the year 2050, between 8 and 9 billion people.  I expect that instead of 1.5 billion affluent people, science, technology, and trade will give us 7 billion affluent people.  And if the Chinese reach half of the pet saturation that we have in this country, that will mean another 250 million companion cats and dogs; none of them vegetarian. We will need to double world food production again.  We will need to triple the yields on the best farmland, because that not only gives the highest yields and the least erosion, it displaces the fewest wildlife species.  The Great Plains had 60 million bison, 100 million antelope, 3 billion prairie dogs.  Thats three species.  The poor land has more, far more, species.  We are farming 37 percent of the land area now.  If we produce for 2050 by simply extending the borders of the fields well be farming 80 percent of the land area. And if you think conventional farming isnt feeding people now, just wait.  And the organic farmers cant do this.  The key is nitrogen.  The Earth had 1.5 billion people before we got nitrogen fertilizer.  We would still be at 1.5 billion people were it not -- that might be better.  You might think you prefer that, but you arent going to get there with zero population growth movements, and you arent going to get there with meatless Mondays.  Youre going to have to triple the yields again on the best farmland.  Plowing itself is a danger.  Summer of 07, 12-inch rainfall in southeastern Minnesota, second- largest concentration of organic farmers in the country.  They not only had flooding; they had mudslides. Whole hillsides sloughed off.  Sandy loam hills should not have been in anything but no- till farming.  No-till cuts erosion by 65 to 95 percent.  It doubles soil moisture.  Its the most sustainable farming system ever developed.  And organic farmers cant use it because you have to have herbicides to kill the cover crops so you can plant what you really want to grow.  They cant kill their cover crops.  And the yields over all are about half as high.  We had a famous study that came out in the summer of 2007 from the University of Michigan, which has no school of agriculture.  The lead author was a fully- qualified geologist.  And they said organic farming can feed the world and more. [applause] Dennis Avery: Youre entitled to believe that, but they made a fairly serious mistake in the paper.  They talked about one study in which green manure crops had put 1,500 milligrams per acre of nitrogen into the soil and that 66 percent of this nitrogen had been delivered to the Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 seedheads of the crops.  That doesnt happen.  Everybody agrees that nitrogen fertilizer puts a higher percentage of its nitrogen into the crop seeds.  Thirty-three percent is the accepted figure.  On green manure crops its 20 percent.  The different between 66 percent and 20 percent is starvation for half of the humans, or the destruction of wildlife habitat on a scale never yet seen in this world. This is not truth, and it is not a favor to you or to the population of the rest of the world to tell something about organic farming that is demonstrably false.  We will have to turn high-yield farming into higher-yield farming.  Thank you very much. [applause]', \"There is a new set of products on the market from Arcadia Biosciences.  They're actually the product of a -- a research mistake at the University of Alberta.  They were trying for drought tolerant crops and instead, they got nitrogen-efficient crops.  Rapeseed, rice and wheat; you can now put on half as much organic nitrogen, get in effect what we thought of as a full crop, with very little left in the soil to leach into the nearby streams.  Can we Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 hope that the organic farmers will, at some point, recognize this benefit and help protect the water with nitrogen efficient biotech crops?\", \"That's impossible.\", 'Another way to --', \"It's certainly working in more diverse ways.  And I want to compliment the organic movement for having been concerned from the beginning with the health of the soil. [applause] Dennis Avery: Unfortunately, unfortunately they aren't using it very well.  And the point he made about the corn getting its growth in the first 90 days means that the organic farmers are starving their corn for part of that 90 days.  They are not getting what that field could produce because the organic nitrogen is slow release.\", \"I have been privileged to watch a program taped by a couple of comedians who perform primarily in Las Vegas who conducted a number of blind taste tests on the street in Las Vegas.  And nobody could tell the difference from nothing.  I grew up on a farm.  Our tomatoes, during the height of the growing -- of the harvest season, were wonderful.  The rest of the year, we didn't get tomatoes except out of cans.  This whole freshness thing, fresher tastes better.  If your organic is fresher, it may taste better.  But that's apart from its being organic.\", \"I think it's useful to point out that if we're talking about the chickens being indoors or outdoors, the reason we get flu every year is from Asia where most of the chickens and ducks are still kept outdoors and they are wandering up and down the street of the village, and it is the interaction between humans --\", '-- and those animals that we get the Asian flu.  We get cholera from hogs. We had -- this is historic.  Most of our epidemic diseases have come about through this close interaction of people and animals, and modern confinement production is protecting you from those diseases. [laughter]', 'So you --', \"Did you say that was the first that's come out after 80 years?\", \"Bruce Ames, University of California Berkeley, one of the most knowledgeable cancer researchers in the world, tested pesticides, tested first synthetic pesticides and found about half of them caused cancer in rats at high doses.  He was applauded by the organic Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 movement.  Then he started testing natural compounds and whether they caused rat -- cancer in rats at high doses.  And about half of them did.  And this is where Dr. Krebs got his point about the 46 carcinogens in the coffee.  And the actual reality is that 99.99 percent of the carcinogens that you ingest are from Mother Nature.  They're there mostly in the plant foods that we eat and consume and brew.  And there if you're eating organic food at all this additional expense, you might be reducing your exposure to cancer by something on the order of 1/10,000 of 1 percent.  I was a little surprised to find that we were also here tonight to discuss the pig poo in the waters of the state of North Carolina. But since I have in fact analyzed the data on that particular question, I can tell you that there has been no change in the water quality in North Carolina since they started growing hogs down there.  There is a problem with the water quality below the cities because the sewage treatment plants don't deal adequately with the people poo.\", 'Not the pig.']\n",
      "['I cant make any money at either one. [laughter]', 'Im used to not making much money.  Only tonight did I learn that I was a rapist.  This will come as a surprise to my family and friends, who dont think much of me, but think more than that.  If youve ever driven through the Midwest on a summer evening, your windshield becomes covered by bazillions of sticky glutinous gobs of insect guts.  Your windshield wiper can cause a wreck because it just smears the stuff around, making your windshield as opaque as the directions for assembling a Christmas present.  The bugs are corn borer moths. Corn borers cause corn to drop ears, corn stalks to fall over.  They also damage the husk of the corn, making it vulnerable to a soil-borne pathogen called aflatoxin, which causes liver cancer in humans.  The insecticide Bt produced by corn grown from genetically modified seed causes corn borers to swell like a balloon and to explode.  I find this very satisfying.  I imagine pops, like a string of firecrackers, like popcorn on a hot stove, as all across my fields corn borers explode.  Bt corn of course disqualifies my crop as organic, even though a nearly identical pesticide is available to organic farmers.  And aflatoxin I should point out is completely natural.  Of course, weve on our farm lost our chance to be organic some 50 years ago.  We have a picture -- we have a picture of my grandfather standing in front of a corn crib.  Hes wearing a faded blue work shirt, overalls turned white from repeated washings, a broad-rim straw hat, and hes carrying two ears of corn, one the before year and one the after, then after had a nitrogen applied to it, artificial raping nitrogen.  The after year was much bigger. Grandpa is grinning widely because hes celebrating a record yield. I should probably point out that our farm has manure as a fertilizer source and at the time planted lots of legumes in long rotations: all practices recommended by the advocates of organic farming, usually writing in a sort of a tone of breathless discovery.  Yes, Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Virginia, people were thinking about soil fertility long before the Oprah show covered Food, Inc. When commercial fertilizer became available, yields went up, costs went down, including environmental costs, as we use less resources to produce the same amount of food.  When this happens in other industries, its generally seen as a good thing.  The father of the organic method was Sir Albert Howard, a British agriculture scientist.  He taught that disease, whether plant, animal, or human, is caused by unhealthy soil, and the secret to good health is farming organically.  According to Howard, The war in the soil is the result of a conflict between the birthright of humanity, fresh food from fertile soil, and the profits of a section of big business.  That sentence could have when Howard wrote it.  Youll notice then, as now, the farmer is strangely absent from this narrative.  Tools of big corporations bought off by seed corn caps and glossy advertisements, were only practicing industrial agriculture because were tools of the man. The truth is better captured by that picture of my grandfather smiling from year to year as he celebrates a record yield.  You may find this bloodthirsty battle using chemical warfare, genetic manipulation distasteful.  Its clear that our opponents here tonight do so. They imagine farming as a holistic walk with nature as we reap her bounty with hardly a mark left on the landscape and a utopia as we discover that connection to soil has been lost because of the application of science to food.  According to them we can walk back our dependence on petroleum, lose our addiction to chemicals and laboratories and be one again with nature.  Rarely has so much nonsense received so much attention from so many outstanding minds. [applause] Blake Hurst: Organic production requires its own set of environmental trade-offs.  Organic food takes more land than conventional farming for the same amount of food.  Organic farming leads directly to more, not less, soil erosion because conventional farmers disturb the soil less.  Organic rules are arbitrary with some practices clearly forbidden because of political pressure instead of science.  Some of the most environmentally costly practices conventional farmers use are approved for the organic farmer as well.  Some of the practices most important for food safety are not available to organic producers.  Hunger is the darkest factor of all and always closer than we expect, particularly in the parts of the world that are most likely to farm organically, although they dont call it that.  Nature doesnt care whether were hungry or well-fed.  We wrest what we can from her reluctant arms each year, and in order to have an adequate supply of food, we have to use all the tools available to us.  Thats the truth.  Thats the truth of this multi-front war we call farming, and as inconvenient as it may be to the critics of the present food system, thats the way it will always be.  Eating organically is trendy, edgy, and advocated by all the right people. Organics consumers shop as a form of conspicuous self-congratulation, a chance to pat themselves on the back for their social conscience, and to enjoy the superiority over the coupon-clipping bourgeoisie shopping at Wal-Mart, though organic consumers should know this: her choices have costs, real costs: environmental costs and costs when it comes to world hunger.  According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, there are a billion hungry people in the world.  Every time Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 someone purchases organic food, more water and more land are used to produce that food than to produce the same amount of food on my farm. Thats the reason why you should vote in favor of the motion.  Organic food is fashionable, cool, an attitude, a chance to identify yourself with beautiful actresses instead of old farmers in overalls.  But mostly, organic food is marketing hype.  Thank you. [applause]', \"Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 Beg to differ -- of course, organic qualifies.  Same subsidies that I do, subsidies are tied to the ground.  They don't ask how you produce the crop.  My question -- I guess I would like to ask, you talked about fertilizer raping the soil. How does the soil know the difference between -- I mean nitrogen, you look at your periodic table.  There it is, it appears.  When I apply nitrogen on some of our acres for manure, when I apply some nitrogen from some of our acres, commercial fertilizer, how does the soil know the difference?\", 'I get this idea that -- Jeffrey says that conventional farming is not feeding the world, so his solution is to produce less food?  I mean this idea -- it is, indeed --', 'Yeah, well give me your example.', \"What's your source for that?\", 'I would like to know the source.', \"No, that is not true.  It's bare earth farming.  Organic farming is bare earth farming.\", \"Of course there is long and extensive testing for -- what the National Resource Council says--genetically modified seed is tested before it goes on the market.  How many of you have bought genetically modified seed?  How many of you have toured Montsanto's laboratories?  How many of you know the process that it goes through?

As to the point of whether it works or not, I guess that is the [inaudible] that's the consumer -- because the NRC says that there is no conceptual distinction, that's the National Research Council, your government, no conceptual distinction exists between genetically modification of plants and microorganisms by classical methods or by molecular techniques that modify DNA and transfer genes.  There is no difference.  It's just a faster and more effective way of improving crops.  The biggest mistake the organics standard made was not accepting genetically modified seeds.  Absolutely.\", \"Well, yeah.  There's a whole lot of -- I mean, at what size does my farm get too big to be moral?  I mean, what size farm is immoral?  When do I become industrial? Female Speaker: Confined animal feeding operations.\", 'Was there a question? Male Speaker: Yes.', 'Okay, yeah. [applause] Blake Hurst: Well, then, of course, the answer would be no. [laughter]', \"The longest term study and the go-to reference, if you look up organic yields, was done at the [unintelligible] Institute.  They had two organic plots, one which used manure as a fertilizer source.  We don't have enough manure to fertilize all the acres that are in crops today.  We would need 5 billion -- 5 billion more cows in order to produce enough manure to use that much fertilizer.  The other crop used a long rotation of using legumes and corn two years out of five, where legumes, in order to produce the nitrogen for the corn or the cash crop the next year.  So there you have it.  That's the final point.  Organic food in any given year can produce the same as conventional food.  But over that five- year period, it only produced 60 percent as much.  60 percent as much.  Two years ago, we were at a 30-year low in food stocks and cereal grain stocks.  Countries were banning the export of rice even here in the U.S.  They limited the amount of rice you could buy because of the short supply.  They were trying to cut down on hoarding.  We can have food problems.  We can't solve them.  We can't have hunger problems.  We can't solve them with organic production.  We Americans take a plentiful supply of food for granted. And we've forgotten that the history of the world is a long search for food security.  We have to remember that the history of agriculture is not a long crime, not a sort of industrial fall from grace, but rather the greatest success story the world has ever seen. The advances in farming and the application of technology to production of food have made us better fed, safer, healthier and richer. Those are very good things, and we should give thanks for our good fortune.  And that's why you should vote in favor of this motion.\"]\n",
      "['That there was no difference in the health benefits.', 'Thank you very much, John, for those words of introduction.  And I should emphasize to all of you, do feel free to applaud at any time during my seven minutes. [laughter] John Krebs: I start off with a disadvantage because, as Bernard Shaw said -- George Bernard Shaw -- we are two nations divided by a common language. So I hope that you will understand what I am saying even though I am speaking the English that occurs on the other side of the pond. Let me explain first of all where Im coming from in this. As the former head of the Food Standards Agency, I am not anti organic, absolutely not anti organic. But what I am is pro accurate consumer information, I am pro healthy eating, and I am pro scientific dispassionate analysis of the facts. Ive got no vested interest. It makes no difference to me whether or not you eat organic food, but I do sometimes get angry about the marketing hype. And let me give you a for instance. Just last week I was watching a television show about diet and health, and on the show there was a woman who was working for a low income, and she had three children, and she said to the interviewer, I feel really guilty because I cannot afford the organic food to feed my children a healthy diet.  And that made me really cross, because she didnt need to buy organic food to feed her children a healthy diet, although -- according to the surveys -- six in ten Americans who buy organic food believe theyre getting a healthier option.  And they are paying for it, because when you go shopping, if you buy organic food, you spend $1.60 for every dollar you would have to spend buying exactly the equivalent food produced conventionally.  So, is it worth paying the extra for health benefits?  The answer is a plain, straightforward, simple no. [applause] John Krebs: Why do I say that?  I say that because Ive scrutinized the evidence.  Now if you look at the evidence, you have to ask yourselves two questions: who is saying it, and why are they saying it?  And of course, if you listen to the organic sector that has a vested interest, they will pick and choose the evidence that supports their case, and no doubt well hear Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 that later on this evening.  But I prefer to believe those groups of people who are independent, impartial, objective groups of scientists put together by official agencies to study the evidence with no side one way or the other.  And its not just the U.K. Standards Agency that John referred, but at the last count, in eight different countries where the federal or national agencies have looked at this issue, in every case they have come to the same conclusion: there is no health benefit of eating organic food when compared with conventional food.  Furthermore, and this is a really important point, in the U.K. we have an advertizing standards watchdog, and a few years ago they penalized our two major supermarket chains for advertizing and claiming that organic food is healthier, and they were stopped. Those supermarket chains were stopped from making that claim.  And note this: they did not come back with a legal challenge.  Why did they not come back with a legal challenge?  Because there was no case to defend.  There was no evident to support their case that would stand up in a court of law.  So what are the supposed benefits, health benefits of organic food?  Some people think that its more nutritious, that it may contain more of those essential micronutrients, vitamins, or antioxidants that are supposed to protect us against cancer.  But when you look at all the evidence together, sometimes organic food does contain more, sometimes it contains less, but taking the picture in the round, there is no -- absolutely no -- consistent difference.  What about safety of food? Because some people say, Well maybe I ought not to take the risk.  Organic food is more natural.  Its safer.  And indeed in Britain 70 percent of the baby food sold is organic because parents are worried about what theyre feeding their children.  Well what are these safety issues?  One thing that people are concerned about is pesticide residues. Maybe the vegetables or the fruit thats been sprayed in a conventional farm leave tiny residues on the surface that you may eat when you consume those vegetables.  Well two things to note.  First of all, organic farmers also use pesticides.  They just use a different set of pesticides.  But secondly, and more important, those residues are they -- when they are present -- in such minute quantities that they are harmless relative to the natural dangerous chemicals that occur in all the food you eat.  How many of you have ever drunk a cup of coffee?  Raise your hands. [laughter] John Krebs: Okay.  Quite a few of you have drunk a cup of coffee.  Well let me tell you, in that one cup of coffee there are more carcinogens that you would get in all the pesticide residues in eating conventionally produced or organically produced fruit and vegetables for a whole year. So if youre worried about potential carcinogens in your food, dont drink that cup of coffee.  But of course, you dont need to worry, because these chemicals may have the potential to be dangerous, but they are in such a low level in the food that you dont need to worry about it.  But in a way, this is missing the point, because you can argue hither and thither about how much of this chemical is in the food, how much of that pesticide residue is present, how much of this vitamin, and so on.  What really counts is looking at Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 the health outcomes.  So, are people who eat organic food healthier than people who dont?  And thats a pretty difficult question to answer, but there is one study thats looked at it, and its an extremely large study.  Its called the Million Women Study.  Its being carried out in the U.K., and its called the Million Women Study, because it involves at least one million women who over a long time period record everything about their lifestyle, including what they eat, and subject themselves to a variety of health measures, including suffering from diseases.  And that study shows that there is no difference in the health outcomes for women that eat organic food and women that dont eat organic food. It doesnt really matter to me whether you eat organic food or not.  Its your lifestyle choice. It doesnt bring you any benefit.  But what does matter to me is when poor people, like that woman I saw on television, feel guilty because theyre not feeding their kids organic food.  Just because of the marketing hype, they feel guilty, and that, to me, is an outrage.  So, I urge you to vote for the motion at the end of this evening. [applause]', \"You're absolutely right that people who purchase organic food tend to be from the wealthier sections of society simply because it's more expensive to buy.  And that's, you know -- you folks that buy it, you can afford it.  There are plenty of people out this in this country who couldn't afford to do it.  Does it mean that you're stupid?  Absolutely not. But it means that to some extent, you have bought in to what I claim is marketing hype. If I can just go back to Urvashi's opening comment, it is absolutely marketing hype that the claim that organic food is healthier for you, and that's why the advertising regulator in the U.K. stamped down on the two major retailers that made this claim, as well as on the organic producer body, the soil association who was making the same claim. It was hype.  There was no case to support it.  And it was banned.  If that isn't a straight forward piece of hype, exaggeration, implicit deception, I don't know what is. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710\", \"The million women study is still going on.  It's been going on now for about eight years. It will continue for another probably 15 or so years.  So we're looking at long term effect and no effects have shown up so far.\", \"I have a simple question to Jeffrey.  If indeed organic production is more efficient, produces more yield per hectare than conventional, why is organic food more than expensive?  Who is making all this extra money?  The reason it's more expensive is because you get less per hectare.\", 'Sorry, could you say that again?  What? Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710', 'No.  What were the two source of organic?  You said there is industrial organic and there is something else organic.  A smaller scale?', \"When we're talking about marketing hype are we talking about the system organic are or we taking --\", \"Just a minute.  No evidence that it's healthier.\", \"Well, as I said at the beginning, you would expect those with organic on their business card to play the claim that organic food is better for you.  Not surprising, Chuck, well done.  But why is this such a divisive issue?  It's a divisive issue because it's a side show from the real problems that we face which are first of all about feeding the growing world population as Dennis said.  And second of all, for those of us who are lucky to live in an affluent society, to eat a healthy balanced diet and secure our own health. Organic food is a complete side show to both of those issues.  Those of us who care deeply about those issues are very frustrated by the repeated claims of the organic sector explicit or implicit that they will solve these problems.\", 'Exactly.', \"It's a very interesting question.  When I was head of the Food Standards Agency, we started sponsoring research to develop such tests.  And such tests can be developed because this is a bit of technical chemistry.  The isotopes of carbon and nitrogen that come from chemical fertilizers are different from the isotopes out of manure or compost. But the organic movement strongly opposed this, and they said it was a complete waste of money to develop these tests.  They never said why they thought it was a complete waste of money.  But I thought I had a pretty good idea that a lot of the produce that's on sale as organic is not actually genuinely organic. And I think it would be a good thing if the regulators did use tests like that and really showed what was on sale in the shops.\", 'Does the regulator carry out the tests?', 'Yeah.', 'Well its very simple.  In that study as in many others, its very difficult to tease apart the contribution of different factors.  Theres no clear proof in that study that the benefits that Chuck has alluded to were to do with eating organic foods, because there are a lot of other differences between the comparison population.  So we still dont have any evidence that organic food is healthier food for you.', \"I just want to make two points very briefly.  First of all, we havent really discussed what is organic food?  When I was head of the Food Standards Agency, I asked to meet with the organic food sector.  Ten people turned up and I said okay, I just want to talk to one Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 of you.  It turned out there were 10 different certification bodies for organic food in the U.K. and they all disagree with one another.  No one body would allow the others to represent their view because they didnt agree on what organic food was.  So its one thing to say that there are standards that are followed, but those standards are completely different depending on who you talk to.  So we should be clear that organic food means different things to different people.  And lets go back over these questions about marketing hype, because whether or not their explicit claims might be made by the organic producers and organic marketers, they are certainly claims that people who buy organic food believe and accept.  And those claims are either that its better for you or its better for the environment.  Weve heard nothing this evening that really provides me with convincing evidence of either of those claims.  Okay you may get more bio-diversity on an organic farm, but if were going to feed people with organic food, we need to turn more land into agriculture and do away with our natural parks and wildlife reserves.  Is that tradeoff worth making? I don't know, but we haven't heard any evidence for it this evening.  Do pesticides pose a risk?  Well, remember that organic farmers use insecticides, including one called Rotinone which is known to cause cancer in rats, is one of the most dangerous pesticides if you're worried about carcinogens in your food.  So if you're worried about pesticide risk, don't eat organic food, don't eat conventional food. In fact, starve to death.  Thank you. [laughter]\"]\n",

      "['Yes.', 'I teach children and teachers, kindergarten through fourth grade.', \"Good evening, everyone.  I too, would like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation especially for having a teacher come and speak because it is a rare occasion for a teacher to actually be able to talk about education.  It's usually think tanks and professors and others.  So I'm really privileged to be here tonight.  Thank you.  The first time I heard about this, don't blame teachers' unions, I, too, thought like Randi.  I'm from the common wealth of Massachusetts.  Which I'm very proud to say is number one in the country.  Our students perform higher than anybody else in this country academically.  Yet we have the strongest collective bargaining rights in the country.  So do me it just doesn't add up. And then I started thinking I'm also a doctoral student so I'm trying to learn as much as I can about research and so the next thing I did is I went straight to the literature.  Even Professor Moe said publications are all saying the same thing.  There is no research to support what he is saying.  There is no research out there that correlates student achievement to collective bargaining rights to teach unionism, either for or against. Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 8 There is no conclusive evidence so people can say what they want.  And publicize.  It doesn't mean that it's research-based.  So with that, what do collective bargaining rates do to improve schools?  And I have a lot to say.  Not only am I a teacher, I'm the executive vice-president of the United Teachers of Lowell, and I deal with this firsthand as a union leader.  And for me, what bargaining rights do is they provide dignity a way to provide dignity for a profession that frankly gets beat up on a lot.  And the way that we can do that is we can ensure language that improves working conditions for teachers, but also for children.  So one example of that, which unfortunately in my district -- my union has not been able to negotiate yet; is something like we could have language for class sizes.  So early childhood children would be in smaller classes which the research shows is good for them, but that's a way we can ensure it, by having it in the teachers' contract.  That's just one example.  The other thing that collective bargaining rights help us with at a local level is it ensures academic freedom.  What that means is there are times as a teacher that I need to advocate for the child.  And that means I have to say something unpopular, something that an administrator might not appreciate me saying in front of a parent, and I need to be able to do that, to be the best teacher that I can be.  And I need to be able to do that without fear.  And that is why collective bargaining rights are very important when you are in a classroom, you need to be able to do what you know is best for children. And that is why it's important.  Besides families, no one cares more about students and their learning, especially students living in poverty, than their teachers.  And what the teachers' unions do at the local level is we serve as a conduit for the teachers. So while my opponents on the motion might say that I have my own agenda, I would argue that is absolutely not true.  My agenda is the agenda of the teachers.  What the teachers need. So the way that we find that out at a local level, the president of our union and the superintendent, along with other members of the executive board go to the schools and meet with the teachers and find out what they need to get their jobs done.  We survey our members.  And what they need in their classrooms is our agenda.  So for example one thing that we've done is we've created what's been called -- the Department of Education in Massachusetts has been called the Cadillac teacher induction program.  So the union and management sat down together, that's the union-initiated protocol, to make sure that every teacher in their first three years of teaching had a qualified and trained mentor. They have access to district designed graduate level courses specifically designed so that they can best meet our students in Lowell who often come with second language issues, they have full training in what they need.  Also with that, the mentors are trained to talk to their mentees about whether they're in the right place or not.  And to counsel them perhaps out of urban education, if that's not what's meeting their need or meeting the children's need.  And also, to help them make better choices.  Another thing that was union initiated that is in our contract, we call the Lowell program.  It's an in-house graduate program where teachers can get their master's degree.  Again, the superintendent and her colleagues have decided what the content of the course is, and we work together so that teachers are given the tools that they need.  In terms of evaluations, our evaluation procedures in Lowell as negotiated are actually more stringent than what's required by state standard.  So our new teachers are evaluated twice every year, whereas the state only mandates once.  So in terms of unions advocating for poor evaluation measures, it's just not true.  The most important thing in my opinion about what we've done -- and I can't speak to 20 years ago because unfortunately, I was only in high school, but I can Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 9 speak to what's happening in schools now.  And what we are doing is this labor management union.  Because with all due respect, we have been -- the teachers have been told what to do.  We've been given scripted curricula from under reading first grants and under these grants, and we found -- the teachers found they were not working for children. 19:09:52 We've told what to do.  Now what we need to do is have a seat at the table to be part of the decision making.  And so in Lowell we have begun this journey to build collaborative structures in our district between labor and management so the people at the ground floor, the teachers, can inform the decisions that are made for children.  So it is, indeed, what is best for them.  Thank you. [applause]\", \"The best from a local standpoint -- in Lowell, Massachusetts, it's quite the opposite. They are actually closing the -- they actually force -- they wanted to close the charter Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 19 school.  And we actually appealed on their behalf, so they have to cut the school in half and stop teaching middle schoolers, and we will absorb those students back in the local --\", \"And the -- the school system.  But what you don't know -- again, you say, oh, teachers are against charter schools.  You're making up the story why -- [talking simultaneously] Kate McLaughlin: -- I am.  Let me tell you why I am.\", 'No, listen to --', 'From a --', \"From a local standpoint, we--from this charter school that was going to be announced-- got students back from this charter school which we welcomed.  We don't get the funding for them for another year.  So when the teachers unions bring up this issue, we're somehow against charter schools.  There are major issues about the funding that comes Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 20 with it.  But when we speak it up, we're somehow obstructionist.  That is not the case. The other issue about charter schools for me and for my type offers union is it's an equity issue.  And my teachers union president has gone even to the governor and suggested that if charter schools are truly innovative, they should be a draft and not a cream of the crop selection.\", \"And that -- and it is a total equity issue because we've all agreed that achievement gaps come from school-based issues.  They come from social issues, and they come from economic issues.  And if you alone base a lottery on which parents have gone to sign up, you have already changed some of those issues.  So it is an equity issue.\", \"Well, and again, I firmly admit this.  I am a Lowell girl, and I don't know everything that goes on in the big wide world.  But our public schools in Lowell are all choice schools. There are no neighborhood schools.  We're a city of a little over a hundred thousand people.  We have 23 schools, and parents choose.  It used to be based on themes, much like the magnet schools.  But unfortunately with the high-stakes testing, the themes have gone to the wayside, and all of the well-meaning grants with mandates attached.  So I can't speak to that.  But the parents do have the choice.  So I actually am a parent of a Lowell public school child.  And I went to the central office and registered him.  I put down my top three choices for schools, very much like what you're all advocating for. And that's our public school system, and that's all something our union supports.\", 'Yes.', \"And we've had choice since I was in elementary school.  We all went to public schools.\", 'I take total exception because my issue as a union leader about charter schools, if they are public schools, and this is my experience as a teacher, and hearing from the other teachers, why is it when a child needs an outside placement that costs over a hundred thousand dollars, the charter school sends them back to the public schools to pay for. [applause] Kate McLaughlin: If they are a public school, that is their student.  They should support him.', 'As a union leader, I see what collective bargaining does for a school in a school system.', \"Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 33 I -- no, it's -- I think it's a complicated question to answer honestly.  No, to answer honestly.  I believe in unionism.  And I believe that -- [applause] Kate McLaughlin: -- a lot of the charter schools are for profit.  And I think that unions help keep the ideals of American values in our schools.  That is my honest answer.\", \"I don't.\", \"And I thank you for that question because that was the biggest myth for me as a new teacher.  I too thought oh, teachers unions keep bad teachers around them.  As I became a building rep and now the vice president, Ive seen these cases actually pan out.  And its exactly what you said; due process is not an easy thing to defend to people.  And its like you said, I mean the defense lawyer didnt murder the person.  But somehow it seems that unions are taking the rap for the actions of someone else when theyre actually defending the due process.  And in the actual case, Ill give you an example, this is what floored me when I learned about this.  Can I just say one thing?  You cant grieve opinion.  So in the case of a principal writing something, and giving a teacher an unsatisfactory -- teachers unions can only talk about the procedures that happened.  We actually can't defend the work of a bad teacher.\", 'We defend procedure which is exactly --', \"Thank you.  It's interesting because I can't help but take this personally because I am a union leader, and I am a proud union member.  And I'm telling that you I'm speaking with the utmost candor that the kids come first to me and to my union president.  The unions are the members, the people in the union, they are not these powerful organizations that secretary Paige will have you believe.  Yes, there are -- there are political implications to what we do because we are advocating for the things that our children need; stable housing, healthcare and access to great and wonderful schools.  So I would ask that you see the people on this panel as people who are actually doing this work on the ground level and working with our administrations to make our school systems better.  We are the conduit for our teachers.  Our teachers tell us what they need in their classrooms, and Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 43 we collect this information, and we work together with our superintendent and other central office personnel to make it happen.  That is the purpose of the United Teachers of Lowell.  There are other aspects to what we do, yes.  We protect due process rights, yes. That is one area.  But what we do is maintain an attractive profession so that we can get the very best teachers teaching in our schools for the benefit of the students.  Thank you. [applause]\"]\n",
      "['Both of us are here tonight.  Secretary Paige, in a wonderful book he wrote with his sister, Dr. Elaine Witty, it was entitled \"The Black/White Achievement Gap: Why Closing it is the Greatest Civil Rights Issue of Our Time.\"  He says in the book, \"Being taught to higher levels means educational support from factors outside of school.  It involves the support and commitment from the entire education triage:  home, school, and community.\"  And Secretary Paige\\'s call to improve the effectiveness of our schools In that article, Professor Moe reports, \"Effective schools treat teachers professionally. The teachers share in the school\\'s goals and effective teaching in the pursuit of those goals.  They participate extensively in school decisions within their classrooms.  They are free to tailor their practices to the needs of their students, that effective schools are organized like teams held together by consensus, cooperation, and shared goals.\"  It Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 12 sounds like a teacher\\'s union to me.  Thank you, Professor Moe.  Now, I must clearly delineate my prejudice, my frame of reference.  I am from the ABC Unified School District, southern California, about 21,000 students.  We\\'re about 89% diverse, 38 different languages spoken in my school district.  We have a remarkable relationship with our affiliate, the ABC-AFT.  We\\'re affiliated with the national American Federation of Teachers, second largest teachers union in the United States.  We\\'ve formed our own charter and ABC is not a charter school.  We have a charter partnership agreement with the ABC/AFT where the main work of the teachers\\' union in my district is student achievement and the conditions that support that.  Student achievement is the main work of our teachers\\' union.  In fact, last year, Laura Rico, the president of my teachers\\' union had a workshop where all the union reps came in and they changed their name from union rep to learning rep.  And they were told by the teachers\\' union president the number one job that you have in this union is student achievement.  Now, that doesn\\'t sound like a teacher\\'s union that has anything other than their main goal, the main idea that Secretary Paige talked about -- in my district, our union, and student achievement.  Here are some examples of staff development in my district that\\'s jointly sponsored by myself and our colleagues, American Federation of Teachers.  It doesn\\'t -- what I\\'m going to describe to you actually comes from the national AFT, from their educational research and dissemination program.  These are some of the courses that are caught by our teacher\\'s union:  instructional strategies that work; reading comprehension; school, family, and community partnerships supporting student learning, which is actually almost exactly what Secretary Paige points out in his book that we need to improve schools.  We spend -- actually my teacher\\'s union spends 10s of thousands of dollars in direct staff development with our community and our teachers to improve learning.  Now, don\\'t blame my district\\'s union for failing schools.  They\\'re one of the reasons my district is successful.  Now, we have our challenges.  We\\'re a program improvement district.  Last year, despite $34 million in budget cuts, we doubled the greatest gains in the history of the district.  We passed the magic benchmark of 814 -- 800, actually in California, went to 814.  We didn\\'t do that despite the teacher\\'s union.  We did that because of the teacher\\'s union.  Let me give you an example.  In my district, 10 of my schools -- these are struggling schools that have just received an innovation grant where each of these schools has a separate program to innovate and improve that school specifically tailored to the needs of that individual school.  That innovation grant came from the American Federation of Teachers National Organization.  $3.3 million in innovation grants funded the ABC Unified School district, 10 of our 30 schools.  That\\'s not just in California or ABC.  Actually, the grant funded programs and districts in 8 different states.  The American Federation of Teachers National Organization is one of the most innovative programs in the United States.  Now, some of the things that those innovation grants are funding in my district, I said partnership efforts in 10 schools.  In other districts throughout the United States, they\\'re working on community partnerships, working on using student assessment data to evaluate teachers.  They\\'re also working on creating charter schools.  So if you\\'re for charters, if you\\'re for holding teachers accountable, using student assessment data, listen to the American Federation of Teachers.  Now, Secretary Paige, Randi Weingarten agrees with you.  That great teachers make the real difference in closing the achievement gap.  In fact, the Washington Post reported in January that Randi said, \"Fair, transparent, and expedient processes to identify and deal with Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 13 ineffective teachers need to be developed.\"  And she specifically pointed to student assessment data.  Now, her direction was put in action most recently in the New Haven Federation of Teachers district by a vote of 842 to 39.  That district agreed to use student assessment data to evaluate teachers.  In addition, they agreed that the city could close schools if they didn\\'t work and change the employees.  Now, twice each year American Federation of Teachers hosts the Shanker Institute. I have been proud to be part of that since 2005.  Let me tell you what we learned at the Shanker Institute.  These are different workshops:  state standards curriculum bridging the gap, partnering for a reform in troubled times, improving the quality and the use of student assessment data.  The unions role in assuring that teacher quality matters -- teacher quality meets student needs.  In every seminar I have been to, there has never been a session on how to keep crummy teachers.  They don\\'t do that.  And in fact, in most cases, the superintendents I know that work closely with teachers unions find that we release more teachers to other industries than we do keeping them.  In fact, in nearby Brooklyn, there is the United Federation of Teacher Institute.  They do much the same thing.  They use data, talk about communication, team building, professional development and action plans.  States with teachers unions set the highest standards, according to Education Week.  U.S. News and World Report reported on the most -- 25 most successful schools.  Six out of 10 of those schools come from states with strong teacher\\'s unions.  Success, high standards, accountability.  If you want that, support teacher\\'s unions in schools where that works. [applause]', 'Charter schools in L.A.', 'Charter schools in L.A. and theres magnet schools in L.A.  L.A. Times article about two months ago by Howard Bloom pointed out that the most successful schools in the L.A. Unified School District are magnet schools.  Now these arent schools that shut down, get rid of kids, get rid of teachers; these are schools that have a special focus, that keep their faculty.  If you want the most successful schools in the L.A. area, its not charters.  Its not traditional schools.  Its magnet schools that have the same configuration, the same union.  If you want success, go with magnets.  Dont go with charters, and dont even go with traditional schools.', 'Most of the magnet -- all of the magnet schools, [unintelligible] [applause] Gary Smuts: Ill answer this in my district.

That doesn't even go through your mind.  I would agree that teachers unions don't rank teachers, but neither do administrators.  There's no ranking of teachers in any school by anybody.  I don't even know if it's possible.  I don't even know if it's desirable.  It wouldn't be something I would recommend that management do or teachers unions do.  I don't think it can be done.  I don't think it necessarily should be done.  There are a variety of factors.  We've all had teachers that have been enormously successful Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 24 with some folks and not very successful with others.  You can't blame teachers unions for not ranking teachers because nobody ranks teachers like that.\", \"That's not true in my district.  The changed their name from union rep to learning rep.

The number one job according to my union president of the union reps, the reps in my district, is student achievement.  And we work together to do that.  It\\'s one of the most powerful forces in our district.  I\\'ve had great administrators and they work with teachers to produce successful students.  Why would you want it any other way? Fighting each other doesn\\'t work.  It\\'s a dumb plan to fight each other and say, \"One side\\'s going to win, and one side\\'s going to lose.\"  I don\\'t believe in that.  You know you got to work together, and if you don\\'t, it is never going to work.  That side said that you never -- Secretary Paige said, \"You\\'re never going to do away with teachers\\' unions.\"  He doesn\\'t want to do that.

Accountability, innovation, standards, high achievement, teacher training, teacher performance measured by student achievement, these are hallmarks of the modern teachers union.  Now some teachers unions aren't modern.  But those that are do these things.  It is implied that the teachers union or non- unionon is the only veritable here.  And they've tried to use weasel words to get out of that.  Oh, not all of them or some of them.  But the case is if you look at the proposition, you have to blame teachers unions, I guess in each and every case.  You have to deny poverty, poor budgets, lack of parental support, poor boards, poor state leadership, poor superintendent.  You have to say none of those things count and only teachers union counts.  They know that's not true, and they've said so.  So you can't blame -- just blame teachers unions.  And you know that.  There's a lot reasons schools don't work.  And it's not just teachers unions.  Professor Moe said that teachers unions are major obstacles to school improvement.  Everywhere?  Not in my district.  So the proposition isn't true in my district.  It isn't true in Kate's district.  It isn't true in a lot of districts.  And you've got to be fair about that.  It's not true in a lot of school districts.  Professor Moe pointed out that principals, 90 percent of them said they can't get rid of bad teachers.  That's not a very good system.  Why not work with teachers unions to get rid of bad teachers?  That's what Randi Weingarten wants to do.  Magnet schools work better than charters.  I'm all for magnet schools.  But the AFT's not against magnet -- charter schools, either.  Larry Sand told us a lot of stories from band camp.  I don't think that that's a good reason to say teachers unions are bad, by sharing horror stories from individual places throughout the United States.  Being a superintendent is a hot, sweaty business.  And it's hard enough Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 42 doing it by yourself.

      "['Absolutely.  Many, many of them.', \"Thank you, John.  Thank you, Bloomberg.  Thank you, NPR and thank you, Mr. Rosenkranz.  Look, we have a double challenge today in America.  One is the need to compete in a global economy, an economy that has changed hugely even as many of us have been wrestling with it.  Number two, we have the effects of the global recession: state and local budgets that are totally and completely decimated right now.  And so when the investment is very, very bleak, as it is right now, and the need is very, very great, it's no wonder that people are looking to find one entity to blame.  But my friends, blaming unions for school failure is like blaming the middle class for the recession.  Ultimately what humans do -- what our union does proudly is have a mantra.  What is good for kids and what is fair for teachers.  Now, am I saying that everything we've ever done is the Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 4 right thing?  Absolutely not.  Am I saying that we are perfect?  Absolutely not.  But what we are trying to do in this very, very turbulent time is search for what works.  Search for what works for kids.  Let me ask -- let me suggest this.  If teachers unions were to be blamed for failing schools, then we would assume that schools in less unionized states would outperform schools in more densely unionized states.  So you'd assume that places like Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, who have relatively few unionized teachers would do much, much better.  But that's not the case.  The states with the most densely unionized teachers, Massachusetts, New York, Maryland; they do the best.  And the countries with the most densely unionized populations: Finland, Japan, they do the best. So what do we learn from that?  What we know is that there are problems like Mr. Rosenkranz said.  There are problems we have to solve.  One of which is poverty.  States like Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi; they have and had been plagued by tremendous poverty.  We have to compete with poverty.  That's what public education is and that is what the search we have for, that's what our search is, to find what works.  So you felt, I hope tonight we can move from scapegoating to solutions, to problem solving.  And I would argue to all of you that having a strong union, someone in an entity that will look at what it's done right and what it's done wrong, and solve things and change things, is the way to go.  So what works?  What can we learn from places like Maryland, Massachusetts, New York State, Finland, and Japan?  This is what we can learn.  This is what works.  What works in places where we don't as Terry Moe will probably argue, where we don't have niche markets, where we can't marketize our schools, where we have to help all kids.  So we need well-prepared and supported teachers.  We need well- rounded rigorous curriculum that engages kids and we can get our arms around.  We need to invest in the tools and the time to differentiate instruction.  We also need things like early childhood education and a focus and fixation on graduation in terms of high school. And finally, we need good services to help level the playing field for kids.  Now, is this a panacea?  Is this something that has never happened and it's a search for something we don't know how to find?  No.  We find these elements in lots of different places.  And the glue that binds us together, the difference between the places that work and the places that don't are good labor management relationships.  Like we see in one of my other panelists here, in the ABC school district in California which has lifted its scores, which has changed its relationships from competitive to ones that are collaborative.  Does that mean as I said before that we've done everything.  Of course not.  Everyone has to take more responsibility in this day and age.  If we're going to ensure that all kids are ready for life, for college, for career, that means that -- that means we all have to take collective responsibility.  And we, at the A.F.T., attempted to do that in any number of ways: first, in pushing for common standards, including the new common core curriculum or the common core standards in pushing for better aligned assessments, in pushing for better curriculum.  And in looking at ourselves and saying look, we have to have a new approach to due process.  We can't have rubber rooms anymore.  We can't have a choice between off with your heads and warehousing.  We can't have situations where if there is incompetence in the classroom we allow that to happen.  We have to have more evaluation systems that are fair, that are meaningful, that are competent, and that actually help teachers teach in a more robust way than they may be doing now.  But we also have to give teachers the tools and the time and the conditions that they need to do a good job with kids.  Because at the end of the day, to compete with poverty, to drift all boats, to Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 5 make sure that kids get that chance to dream their dreams and to achieve it, it comes with initially that connection between teacher and kid.  That connection we made every day that we teach.  That connection I made with my kids at Clara Barton High School that I know Gary made when he taught.  I know Kate made when she teaches.  We need teachers to have the support of the people around us and the unions.  The unions --  all of us.  The unions will do everything in their power to help fight for the tools and the conditions that teachers need and to fight to ensure that every kid, every kid gets a well prepared and well supported teacher.  Thank you very much. [applause]\", 'Well, given that the United Federation of Teachers under my watch, started two charter schools in Eastern York, its totally and completely untrue.  What we want to do is we want charters to be held to the same accountability standards including the ones that we started, as any other school and what the evidence has been in New York, like the evidence around the country, is that charter schools instead of, as Diane Ravitch said, should take more of the most at-risk kids are actually taking fewer special needs kids and fewer kids with limited English proficiency.  So weve open to, we think charters could be a great incubator for instructional practice and could be a great incubator for labor relations practice.  But Terry, I dont want New York to be as much as an evidentiary zone as Washington D.C. seems to be, which means lets look at the Credo story which were done with a pro-charter advocate.  What they said was, where 17 percent of the charters are better than public schools, 34 percent are worse, and the rest are the same. The idea is to actually find what works, make it sustainable and make it replicable. Thats what were trying to do and thats what Im trying to do.', 'I mean, whats interesting Terry is that I didnt know you were in my head so much.  We are not running charter schools to unionize all charter schools.', 'What we wanted to do, what we wanted to do was actually the New York City and State Union were in favor of lifting the cap and in favor of creating a level playing field to make sure that all kids could equally get into all schools.  And if you recall, New York State became one of the finalists for Race to the Top so obviously whatever happened in the state legislature didnt disqualify us from Race to the Top.  The bottom line is, we need schools -- all schools: charter, public, private to be places where parents want to send their kids and where educators want to work.  Thats the bottom line.  How do we help all kids, not just some kids, but all kids. [applause]', 'Terry, I wish we had the kind of -- [applause]', \"So, Terry, you've actually just made the point that I think many of us are trying to make on this side, which is it is complicated.  There is not one factor that either causes student success or -- or is an obstacle to it.  And that's exactly what we are trying to say.  So ultimately, just like we did not say that teacher unions were the reason why Maryland or Massachusetts or New York were so successful -- and by the way, that was just in quality counts from education week.  We were not the ones that said that Finland or Japan were most successful.  We're just saying that those are the correlations.  Now, there is one person who used to actually agree with you hugely Diane Ravitch who, in looking at much of the evidence over the course of time, whether it was on charters or whether it was on vouchers has thrill just written a book saying slow down.  The evidence of these kinds of market strategies just doesn't work.  My point is this:  Whether you look at -- everyone is going to find anecdotes to fit into their case.  That's not going to help one more child learn.  We are searching for what actually works.  So regardless of the quotes when they hurl at me from the NEA or from other places, I stand by the record that we have in turning around schools in New York City.  Mr. Rudy Crew, who is sitting there, and I, together did probably the most important reform strategy in New York in the late 1990s, early 2000, where we actually turned around schools in Harlem.  We turned around schools in New York City.  We want to make sure every single child has a choice. Once they have a choice for a charter, so be it.  But every child should have a choice for a Intelligence Squared U.S. Prepared by National Capitol Contracting  200 N. Glebe Rd., #710 22 neighborhood high school or a neighborhood school.  And Larry, last point to you, which is this:  Just recently, unlike what you said about LA, in LA, there were 36 schools that were put up for grabs by the LA school board.  The charters love this.  They wanted this competition.  And in that competition, regular school teachers, supported by their union, won 29 of the 36 schools because of their plans.  The bottom line is we need to do the things that Gary and Kate talked about in terms of helping all kids, well prepared and supported teachers, real engaged curriculum, safe and orderly environments which is what we see in charter schools all the time, good, good management that works together. And at the end of the day, if we have to find ways, as I said in 2004, to police our own profession, fire teachers that are not making the grade, we want to do that.  That's who this teachers union is.\", 'We want the best and the brightest for all of our young people in this country.', 'Sorry.

And if you look at the three of us, and you actually listen to our members, youre actually right.  We are paid to listen to our members because very few other people actually do listen to the voices of teachers.  There was a Gates study recently that said that of 40,000 teachers, that said that overwhelmingly what they wanted; number one issue is they wanted to be supported; they wanted to be respected.  That is very similar to polling that we have taken of our members and very similar to what I see when I was a local union president, where we had the most extraordinary people in New York City teaching in our classrooms.  What we see is that members by a four to one and five to one margin have said to us, they want us to fight for the tools and conditions they need to do their jobs.  And ultimately, when we try to fight for budgets for schools, when we try to fight for equity; when we try to fight to ensure that class sizes are low and that theyre safe and reasonable environments for kids so that kids dont get bullied, when in some ways we try to fight for the things that I know the Harlem parents have tried to fight for in the schools that they have.  Thats the integration between teacher unions and kids.', 'I think none of have enough information about the specifics about this.  I probably have more than the rest of us.

Now, having said that --\", \"Well --  it's not --\", \"Well, but I think that the tone -- what I have experienced in terms of New York City is that in a -- most teachers right now, as we are speaking, are at home actually grading papers and marking lessons.  And frankly, from my perspective when I was the teachers union president here, I never actually asked people to come or pack an audience or do these things, from my perspective.  I can't talk for other than myself.  In terms of the question about firing, what tends to happen in the teaching ranks is that there is a huge attrition rate of teachers.  And so you have essentially half the new teachers within the first five to seven years actually leave the profession because it is such a tough, tough, tough place to work.  And whether it's because they don't get the support that they need or a variety of other things, whether it's salaries or other things, what you see is that you use both the statistics of how many people have attrited out.  And in New York City last year, my understanding was that about 30 to 40 percent of the teachers, or about 30 percent of the new teachers attrited out within the first five years in terms of firing on what the statistic is. But I will tell you, in terms of the peer intervention process and program that we started in 1987, first under my predecessor, Sandy Feldman and then myself, we actually counseled hundreds of teachers out of the profession who we thought, after we tried to help them, were not up to snuff.

Now, the issue around the country -- and I believe the same way as Kate, I had lots of opportunities in my life to do lots of different things, I chose not only to be a teacher but I chose to be a union representative.  I chose to do this because I believe in my heart and in my soul that what unions do for kids and for teachers as well as for working people is to lift all boats.  I said this initially.

The issue, and I said this a couple of months ago in a speech that neither you, nor Larry, nor Rod have actually acknowledged in the work that you\\'ve -- or the statements you\\'ve made today, we want to have valid and reliable evaluation systems.  Teachers do not like when they are just simply thrown the keys and told, \"Do it.\"  There are many of us when we first started teaching who had real frustrations in terms of not being able to connect to kids, not knowing how to do the things we needed to do.  And ultimately what we\\'ve yearned for is to have real development and evaluation programs.  And, in fact, Larry, I said just two months ago, student learning must count as part of teacher evaluation, and ultimately what the ABC School District is doing, what actually the Central Falls School District was doing before the teachers were fired en masse was to try and create these evaluation systems that Arne Duncan and I have both said are really required.', \"I'm saying in New York City.\", \"That's actually not true, Larry.\", 'A lot of unions have done that.

I think about the kids that I taught at Clara Barton High School.  I think about the millions of kids in this country who, but for public education, will not have a chance at life.  I think about the thousands and thousands of teachers who are isolated in individual classrooms and who, frankly, have no interest in the status quo and who join a union or stay in a union because they want voice in how their kids get a decent education.  I have been in three schools a week when I was the president of the United Teachers in New York City.

      "['worked.', 'burrow deeper into failure.  Measured by any standard, American policy toward Israel has failed over the past couple of decades.  We are no closer to any kind of peace.  Israelis and Palestinians today stand further apart than ever.  They are estranged.  They are mistrustful.  They are antagonistic.  They can scarcely even imagine peace.  We will therefore submit to you tonight that rather than burrowing deeper into failure, and so jeopardizing American interest, the United States should reconsider its ties with Israel.  It should step back from its special relationship in favor of a normal relationship.  Now a normal relations between allies, and the United States and Israel must remain firm allies, are often marked by differences.  With France, with Japan, with Germany, with Turkey, important allies all, America has regular and often open disagreements. What makes America\\'s relationship with Israel is its uncritical nature, even when U.S. interests are being hurt.  What also makes the relationship special is the incredible largess that the United States shows towards Israel, over the past decade, $28.9 billion in economic aid.  And on top of that, another $30 billion in military aid, that\\'s almost $60 billion.  That\\'s 10 times the GNP of Haiti that is being gifted to a small country.  Now, I ask you, to what end is this money being used.  Ladies and gentlemen, we would submit that it ends often inimical to the America interest. Take the ongoing Israeli settlement program in the West Bank, at a cost of about $100 billion, this enterprise has grown the number of settlers in the West Bank from about 140,000 in 1996, to about 300,000 today.  If you add the roughly 150,000 Israeli\\'s in East Jerusalem, you get to a number of 450,000 Israelis beyond the 1997 border.  That\\'s not all.  Money has poured into a repressive apparatus involving settler-only highways, reserved military areas, a separation or security barrier.  The Israelis call it \"separation wall\", \"hated separated wall\" the Palestinians call it, a barrier that burrows into the West Bank and annexes 10% of the land.  What\\'s the result of this? Well the result is an isolated, fragmented, atomized, fractured, humiliated Palestinian presence that simply makes a nonsense, at first, of the notion of \"Two States for Two Peoples\". What I observe there on my visits to the West Bank amounts to a kind of primer in colonialism. Imagine, Israelis in their fast cars, Blackberry-ing away, booming down these super highways, while Palestinians on their donkey carts make their way on dirt tracks, if they can get there, to their orchards.  This is a primer in colonialism, much more than it resembles a nascent Palestinian state.  Yet, \"Two States for Two Peoples\" is the declared U.S. objective.  In effect, the United States is bankrolling the very Israeli policies that are dashing its own aims and the hopes for Oslo by making two states almost unimaginable.  Does this make sense? Is that clever? I don\\'t think so. And if you don\\'t think so, ladies and gentlemen, you should vote for the proposition tonight. Now, the United States has raised its voice occasionally.  Jim Baker, for example, Secretary of State in \\'89, said, \"Foreswear annexation.  Stop settlement activity.\" Now fast forward two decades to Barack Obama, in Cairo, two decades in several hundred thousand settlers, he said, \"The United States does not accept legitimacy of the continued Israeli settlements.\" And what did Prime Minister Netanyahu do two weeks ago, planted settlings in various settlements, and they are part - and said, \"They are part of Israel for all eternity.\" Now in a normal relationship, there would be consequences to such defiance.  In a special relationship, the one that exists, there are no such consequences.  Now, America\\'s perceived complicity in Israeli violence carries a heavy price.  Jihadi terrorism aimed at the United States is not primarily motivated perhaps by the Palestinian issue, but it is a major factor.  It is a potent terrorist recruitment tool.  The United States should stand by its allies.  And Israel is an ally.  But if America is to pay the blood, and the treasure, and the last piece of mind that comes with supporting Israel, it should be ready at least to speak openly and critically of Israeli mistakes when needed.  To boost, ladies and gentlemen, are unhealthy, a climate that affixes charges of anti-Semitism to anyone critical of Israel, and self-hating Jew to any Jew who\\'s critical of Israel, is unhelpful.  For if there are not two states, there will be one state. And sooner or later, the number of Palestinians in it will outnumber the number of Jews.  And what then will remain of the Zionist dream? Ladies and gentlemen, there\\'s also a moral issue here.  I am a Jew.  I know that Israel at its foundation and its declaration of independence said it would, \"Ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants, irrespective of religion, race, and sex.\" We, Jews, know in our bones what persecution is.  Alas, and this is hard to say, Israel, has in my view, lost touch with these fundamental values.  By uncritically supporting Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza, America is undermining its own values, which at the very least stand for the absence of second class citizenship and equality of opportunity.  Yes, I know Israel\\'s a vibrant democracy isolated in the Middle East.  And its values are closer to ours than those at closed Arab societies.  But that does not mean that we should endorse Israel\\'s systematic dismemberment of the Two State option.  And if President Obama is serious about reaching out to the Muslim world, America must appear much more as an honest broker and less as Israel\\'s spokesman.  And that requires a serious re-balloting.  You will, I suspect, hear that Israel is a lonely David facing an Arab Goliath.  You will hear that it needs blanket American support to be secure.  This is simply not true.  Nuclear-armed Israel is powerful.', 'you to vote for the motion tonight.  Thank you.', \"here. Nobody is arguing that Israel should cease being an ally of the United States. So, we are simply arguing that when President Obama says that he wants settlements to stop and settlements continue and Prime Minister Netanyahu declares that some settlements are Israel's for all eternity, that there should be consequences, and I believe that if the United States were firmer if it made clear to Israel that there are indeed consequences, then Israel would measure its actions much more carefully and there would be more chance of getting a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks, which are currently paralyzed. Israel, if it thinks it can act with complete impunity is not going to be responsive to U.S. desires.\", '', 'And my perception of European publics and European governments is that many are bewildered by the extent and degree of U.S. support for Israel and would applaud some modification of that relationship.', \"with the Cairo speech, with the speech in Istanbul, with other gestures. But when it comes to actions, and people are looking at actions, I think the Palestinians tend to see more of the same. And that is the issue here. Can we be imaginative? Can we think outside of the box? Look, when the Oslo Accord came in the 1990s, the PLO Charter still existed. It existed until 1996 in its original form calling for the annihilation of Israel. Now did this stop the imaginative negotiators in the 1990s from moving that process forward. Oslo was 1993; this was done while the charter still existed. The Hamas charter calling for annihilation of Israel is vile. It is unacceptable. But can we think outside the box about these things? Can we look for new forms of engagement? Can we think and act in different ways that might advance peace? I think, so far, the verdict on the Obama administration and on what Mr. Mitchell has been trying to achieve is no. And I it is important that we look at the Middle East the way it is, not the way we would like it to be or imagine it might be, but what the reality of this increasingly sophisticated Middle East is today what is Hamas really? What is bothered really? Let's look at these things in a hard headed way and let's think about and find some new ideas. And I think right now the president in a half way house and that's why we seeing no movement.\", 'changed through negotiations.', \"how you can state there is no economic aid going from United States to Israel. I don't know. In response to your questions I - critics of Israel are often told that they are anti Israeli. My response is no, I think in have the long-term interest of Israel in my heart and to say that it is Israels interest to go on building these settlements strikes me as the height of foolishness because what will be the result of this? We are at the point or we are very close to the point where a two state solution becomes impossible. At that point, we are talking about a single state between the river and the sea. That state will very soon - such a state will very soon have more Palestinian Arabs in it than Jews. What then is going to happen to the Zionist dream? And I think to point this out to Israel, is in fact acting in Israel's self interest, and the unfortunate thing about U.S. policy is it doesn't - without stepping back it doesn't act strongly enough to stop Israel making a two-states solution impossible. And I think that is the very core of the issue here.\", \"withdraw, remove, a very powerful recruitment tool - for the jihadis. If you look at Osama Bin Laden's speeches going back a very long way. If you look in the 9/11 report it what Khalid Sheikh Mohammad said, the mastermind of 9/11 about how policy toward the Palestinians was really what drove him toward the - It wasn't his stay in the United States. It was what he observed of U.S. Israeli policy toward the Palestinians. So, if you can appear more as an honest broker, if you can move this paralyzed process in some way, then I think you could advance U.S. security in that respect. Look have the Palestinians made mistakes, have there been office on the table that should perhaps have been accepted, yes. But we're not talking about the past. We're talking about trying to move forward here, that is what this debate is about tonight, and I think to throw out the Olmert offer when he was already had great legal difficulties, was on his way out of office, it really wasn't credible at that point. So I don't find that in any way persuasive.\", '', \"That's more I believe than all the vetoes put together of all the other members of the Security Council. This is indeed a special relationship. And the question we're asking tonight is, is that really in the benefit of the United States and Israel? And I would submit not. If you look at the Goldstone report, the UN report on the war in Gaza, surely this report was imperfect. No doubt there were errors in it. I know Judge Goldstone. I met him years ago and the Hague, believe me, he is balanced and intelligent man. Did he make some mistakes, yes, but the Israeli reaction was, no this is just an expression of the world's bias, this is an outrage. This is absolutely unacceptable. And the U.S. gave it some protection in that stance, which I consider to have been outrageous. There is no justification for the position what is happened since. Israel has quietly censured two generals. It has agreed to pay compensation to the United Nations. Behind the defiance, it has been making its own admissions of the fact that they were problems in this, and I think it is the United States' special relationship with Israel which allows it to say before the world, no, we never make mistakes, this is all a plot against us, and I don't think this is helpful to Israel. And it is not good for the United States to be in that position.\", \"very serious Israeli attempts to make peace. But if you look at the last 20 years, peace is going to involve an exchange of land, and what has Israel continued to do over the last 20 years? It has doubled, tripled the size of the settlements in the West Bank and this simply makes it impossible to make that exchange. Look, what we just heard about what's happening in the West Bank shows that there is nothing congenital about a Palestinian inability to take responsibility for their lives and for their governance. Given half the chance, I think they are capable of it. But when, if you, have you driven through the West Bank recently, madam? Sarah Lehman:  Yes. Roger Cohen:  What did you see? I think you saw a fractured, divided Palestinian community. Israeli garrisons on every hill, road blocks, the difficulty of families to get to the market, to get the fields, to get to their jobs and so on. What does this say to Palestinians about the seriousness of Israeli intent to make peace? It says these guys are not serious, and why has it that the Prime Minister Fayyad has not come back to the table. He has not come back to the table because the Palestinians are not satisfied of the essential seriousness of Israel. And what is enabling the government or Prime Minister Netanyahu to take this stance, it is the unconditional nature of U.S. support under the special relationship, which is why ladies and gentlemen you should vote for the proposition tonight.\", 'solution, which is the only way to avoid a one state outcome.', '', \"such as President Obama is now trying to accomplish extremely difficult. There is a state called Florida. It's a vital state in the U.S. presidential election. It has a large Jewish community. This calculation is not lost on Americas leadership. President Obama, I understand, has been told by some Jewish congressman, if you want your health bill, step back on Israel. So the reality is indeed that it is very hard  [hissing and boos from audience] I have heard that reliably. The reality of the situation is that it is extremely difficult to steer a U.S. public opinion in any way toward any acceptance of an adjustment of policy towards the State of Israel. I think it should be done in the following terms:  The President should explain that the adjustments he is making are in pursuit of peace and in pursuit of the long-term peace and security of the State of Israel. Policies up to now have failed. Therefore, we should see a change.\", '', '', \"in the West Bank. Certainly, under the current conditions there are some who live there, I am not going to argue with this, that Israel is by far the most liberal and democratic state in the region.

It has everything except peace, and what we are talking about tonight is how the best to stay here this remarkable society toward whether it's requesting for and I don't think it's through the policy that Israel is currently pursuing or through the current banking that United States is giving for those polices that is what we are debating. Would a Palestinian state is ever comes into being should it offer ecology of opportunity for citizens of all race, religion, background, et cetera, yes, it should.\", \"the end, what are they are arguing for? They are arguing for more of the same. If you think more of the same is fine, if you think the growing hatreds, antagonism, estrangement in the area is just fine, then you should vote against the resolution and not for it, as we are arguing. I don't believe that's the case, I believe what's going on is unhealthy and the United States by stepping back would put pressure on Israel to adjust its policies and open new avenues to the new Middle East of which President Obama has spoken. In the end, you have to put your backbone where your wish bone is, and what does America wish for? Two states, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security. And as we have described, uncritical U.S. support of Israel in policies that undermine the possibility of two states is just a recipe for further failure. What does America also wish for under President Obama? He wants a new relationship with the Islamic world. This will require more than just words and pretty speeches. It will require a new balance in the U.S. approach to the region a new readiness to speak to enemies, only then will we move forward. And if you think as Stu Eizenstat just suggested that if the United States succeeded in establishing a new and more harmonious relationship with the Islamic world this would have no effect whatsoever on the terrorist threat that the United States faces. Believe me, I think you are wrong. I would like to conclude with the words of Mahmoud Darwish, the great Palestinian poet who died last year and he wrote in his poem State of Siege, me or him that how war starts but it ends in awkward stances, me and him. It's time for American policy to reflect better the him and the me of the Middle East.

      "['', 'snowstorm.  You\\'ve heard from our opponents, one of our opponents, a pattern that we\\'ve heard a great deal of.  And if you listen to the advocates of the special relationship with Israel, you would think that all is for the best and the best of all possible worlds.  Well I\\'m here to tell you that it\\'s not.  You heard from my colleague, Roger, exactly how bad the situation is.  I strongly recommend the next time any of you have a chance to go to the Holy Land, that you take a little time away from your trip to Israel and spend some time in the West Bank, spend three or four days.  And you will see precisely how bad it is.  Now, I would be the last person, as a Middle East historian, to suggest that all the problems in the Middle East are caused by the U.S. special relationship with Israel.  They\\'re not.  There are problems with Arab governments.  There are problems among the Palestinians.  There are problems inside Israel.  But some problems are caused by this special relationship.  Let me just list a couple of them.  One of them is that there is, as a result in large measure of our special relationship with Israel, an almost total deafness to public opinion in Palestine and in the Arab world.  We hear the same kind of mantra about there\\'s no democracy, there\\'s no public sector.  There are all kinds of things going on in public opinion in the Arab world.  And one of the things that\\'s going on is a deep distrust and unease with U.S. policy over this issue in particular.  A second thing that has to be said is that there is a suspicion, in public opinion in particular all over the Arab world, of the fact that the United States in the Middle East because of this special relationship is not and cannot be an honest broker. Everybody knows that the United States engages in prior coordination with Israel, as a result of an agreement made by Secretary Kissinger back in the 70s, before anything starts between Arabs and Israelis.  Everybody knows, in other words, that there\\'s a big fat U.S. thumb on the scales when the United States act as a mediator.  I recall, in the negotiations in Washington, we were in an impasse with the Israeli side, and we were told, after much reluctance on their part, that the State Department of the United States would come with a bridging proposal.  We were very pleased.  They came with a bridging proposal that was worse than the position that the Israelis had offered us.  This is what the special relationship gives you.  It gives you a country that cannot act as an honest broker.  And let me say something about United States reliability. Let me say something about what the United States looks like after 20 years when American presidents, since President Carter, have said not just that they were going to make peace with Egypt, which they did, but that they were going to make peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  We have systematically failed in this effort over the past 20 years.  The situation is - 30 years in fact.  The situation is infinitely worse today than when Ambassador Rabinovich and I went to Madrid in October of 1991.  It\\'s worse for the Palestinians.  It\\'s worse for the position the United States in the Arab world if you care not what autocratic governments think, but what the people think about us.  And this brings me to the main reason you should vote for this proposition.  You should vote for this proposition, in our opinion, because the United States should be true to its principles.  It should be fair.  It should be equitable.  It should be just.  We give, as Roger said, $60 billion over the past 10 years to Israel.  We are in effect engaged in supporting an occupation that has been going on for 42 years and counting.  We are in effect underwriting settlements.  And we\\'re not just using that with U.S. money that\\'s fund - U.S. tax dollars out of our pockets that\\'s fungible.  We are doing that with tax deductible contributions to settlements, to projects in the occupied West Bank, and essentially to doing things that are directly opposed to United States policy and to the interest of the United States not to speak of the interest of peace in the Middle East.  We hear a great deal about security whenever Israel is talked about.  We have to be concerned with Israel\\'s security.  Fine, we have to be concerned with the security of everybody in this region if we are going to be an honest broker, if some people are not of a higher importance to us than other people.  What about the security of Palestinians? In the recent war in Gaza, it wasn\\'t really a war.  It was a one-sided affair.  There were 14,000 people killed on one side and 14 on the other side.  If we\\'re concerned with human security, we should be concerned with numbers like this.  We should be concerned with the fact that everybody knows that we are engaged not just in funding, financing, supporting diplomatically, but also in selling weapons that are engaged in doing these kinds of things.  Now what can the United States do? In my view, it can do many things.  It\\'s not enough to say, \"Oh, it\\'s a shame.  The Palestinians are divided.\" The Palestinians are divided.  They have deep, deep internal divisions.  The United States has been working systematically to deepen those divisions.  The United States should be helping to unite the Palestinians around a consensus whereby they can come forward and negotiate, rather than trying to keep them divided as we\\'ve been trying to do if our objective is not to weaken them, which is an Israeli objective.  If our objective is peace, then there has to be not just an Israeli consensus for peace, there has to be a Palestinian consensus for peace.  We have done everything possible to prevent this.  This is one thing that we can and should do.  What else can we do? I would argue that our policy should be linked not solely to what the stronger party - by far the stronger party in this relationship wants.  That is no way to make peace.  Again and again, what the United States has an effect done is to help gang up on the Palestinians.  The United States has to pull away from this special relationship with Israel if it is to play any kind of effective role in making peace.  Now, this is particularly true because the hardest issues between the Palestinians and the Israelis, much harder than anything that had to be dealt with between Israel and Jordan or Israel and Egypt have to do with issues that resonate all over the Arab world, things like refugees, things like Jerusalem.  These are not easy issues.  If we stand with the stronger, as we have done consistently on these and other issues, if we stand with Israel and ignore the fact that these are not just things on which there\\'s a claim on both sides, but most importantly, these are things that will negatively affect U.S. interests.  If we take a one-sided position, we are harming U.S. interests throughout the region.  If you vote against this proposition, I would argue, you are voting for the status quo.  You are voting for more of the same.  You are voting for a peace process that has delivered a lot of process and no peace.  And that is what we have gotten from every administration up to this point.  We have peace with Egypt.  We have with Jordan.  Peace with the Palestinians is much farther away.  I would suggest that voting for this status quo is to say in effect, \"We\\'re going to bury our heads in the sand. We\\'re going to allow a Two States solution to disappear.\" I personally don\\'t think it has very many changes anymore.  But if this is something that is important, if we do not want the future for Israel that many Israelis see, where Israel continues to rule over the Palestinians, we should vote in favor of this proposition.  Thank you very much.', 'deeper. I mean we have enabled, we have enabled, the worst instincts of Israel politics. We have enabled and supported and financed the worst policies in terms of, leave aside American interest. We are all Americans that should be the only thing that matters to us. Israeli interest, why is occupation and settlement in the Israeli interest? Ambassador Rabinovich is opposed, is an opponent of these things. Most right thinking Israelis that most of know are but Israeli politics is moving exactly the opposite direction. What we are doing is enabling these tendencies. Let me say one other thing about constancy. When we are doing something that everybody in the world think is dominant. The idea of staying the course does not make us look constant, it makes us look dumb. And our allies we were asked rhetorically by one of my opponents, if United States moved away from the special relationship what will happen with some of our allies, they would applaud. They see the United States as systematically weakening itself by this perverse special relationship.', \"United States in any way an honest broker. United States is quite frequently the only broker because United States hugs the stage. Look at what the United States does to the quartet, it essentially tries to turn them into bunch of oodles who will follow the American lead, it successfully does that quite frequently even with European Union and with the Russians. And I think this is actually a problem. We have seen more constructive diplomacy in the Middle East from Qatar and Turkey; incidentally an important Democratic ally. A country with a public sphere. A major ally over decades going back to launching of NATO. The only democracy in the Middle East is not Israel. And we have seen more constructive diplomacy from those two countries than we have seen from the United States over the past several years as far as brokering a peace between or trying to broker a peace. For example, arranging a settlement of the conflict in Lebanon, and I would suggest that it is in the United States' interest to bring others in. It's in the United States interest to make this a multilateral settlement. James Baker, to his enormous credit, understood this. And that's one of the most important achievements of Madrid. It was to bring other parties in, that United States has this tendency to monopolize things. It is a tendency to be resistant.\", 'Hamas right now. Israel negotiates with Hamas all the time. In fact it suits Israel perfectly, perfectly to have Hamas and Fatah divided and to have nobody to talk to. You will have peace in this part of the world between Palestinians and Israelis when there is not just a Israeli consensus but a Palestinian consensus. There are enough people in Hamas who are interested in a resolution of this conflict that if, as Roger said if you think outside the box, we could get something.', \"because he is weak. He is weak because we have made him weak. He is weak for other reasons as well. But a primary reason is because Israel and the United States have systematically undermined him. What happened with the Goldstone report? I don't want to go into the Goldstone report. Abu Mazen was pressured, was blackmailed, was threatened by the Israelis to, in effect prevent the consideration by United Nations Human Rights body of a report that was critical both of Hamas and especially of Israel. This is an example of the kind of situation that Abu Mazen is in. Why is he in this situation? He is in the situation because he does not represent all the Palestinians, and he is in that situation because the Palestinian coalition government which would have included have Hamas was something that was strongly opposed both by Israel and the United States. And that would have been a government in which Hamas would have authorized Abu Mazen to ahead and negotiate with Israel. That would have been a government that might conceivably have reached an agreement or might not have. But it certainly would have better than the situation we are in. And let just create one point about the special relationship. One of the things that the special relationship does is it imports Israeli considerations into U.S. law. I was told by an American official one of the reasons we can't have a Palestinian coalition government which might in fact be a better negotiating partner is because it's against U.S. law. We would have to cut-off our funding to any government that included Hamas even a government that authorized negotiations for peace. That is an example of why we should end this special relationship.\", \"sainted Nelson Mandela, a man who I think, we all greatly respect. He headed an armed movement. He was not an apostle of non-violence. He led an armed movement that succeeded in forcing a political resolution of a conflict. Now, I personally am a believer in this conflict, now, that non-violent means are the best means for the Palestinians. I don't think, however, that we should get too mystical about this. There are many colonial, many oppressive, many occupation regimes that would never ever disappeared but for armed violent resistance. That is something that - that is something that's very painful to say because in this country, we have a constitution, and what Martin Luther King was calling for was that we live up to the highest principles of this country. I argue that in the Palestinian case, that would be appropriate, although for other reasons. But to say in a situation of occupation, and in a situation of oppression, this is not two equal parties. These are not two states. There is one country between the Mediterranean and the sea. It occupies the entirety of the territory. It's the only sovereign state. It has ruled every single Palestinian in that territory, some of them as citizens of the State of Israel, a minority, four million of them as helots with no rights for 43 years, resistance in that case is legitimate.\", 'defend this institution. I think it ill - it does not behoove those who are friends of Israel to bash United Nations. The certificate of Israel is delivered by the United Nations in the form of the resolution that Ambassador Eizenstat mentioned, the partition resolution of 1947. Now that did not give the issue a sliver of Palestine. It gave 33% of the population that owned 6% of the land, 55% of the country; some sliver. Let me say a couple of other things. I cannot let some of these things pass simply as a historian. We are told that the Arab countries have been rejecting everything since 2010. The majority of Arab countries came to the Madrid Peace Conference. Ambassador Rabinovich and I saw them there. Now what kind of rejection is it when they come to a peace conference. They all voted in favor of an Arab peace resolution in Beirut and one before that, way back in 2002. This is not rejection. We were told about remarkable concessions. Remember, when a country is in illegal occupation of territory and it agrees to give it back, there are various ways of talking about that. I would not use the word concession. Thirdly ', '', '', 'U.S. government documents and you go to the extraordinarily ample Israeli documentation, you will see that not one Israeli military intelligence or American military intelligence report or military officer of field rank and above thought that there was any chance of Israel being defeated let alone eliminated in the 1967 war. I know people here believe that was a possibility, I know that many people in Israel feared it, but that was not a possibility at that time. I could go on and on.', \"issue in Palestinian history about the responsibility of the Palestinians have to consider for things that have happened in Palestinian history not just in the last couple of decades, but going back to the 20s and 30s, I think it's a question that should be asked by Palestinians and to Palestinians, and I take the point. What can Palestinians do? Firstly, they have to get their act together. It's absolutely essentially that there be a Palestinian consensus on how to get out of the mess that they are in, and that's up to the Palestinians themselves. Nobody else can do that for them and that's the first thing. We are taking about Israel because that's the proposition before the house. You voted on something about the United States and Israeli special relationship, but I think it's a good question anyway because this is a key element of this problem. The Palestinians, I have to say, have not just been systematic divided by outside forces. They have failed to unify themselves. The Palestinians have not just failed to generate some of the leadership that I think they deserve. I have been very critical of Palestinian leadership in the past. It is however the case that their leadership has been systematically subject to assassination, not just by Israel, also by Arab governments, and they have problems not only with Israel, they have severe problems with all of the Arab governments with which they have to deal. Governments which by and large are not democratic, governments which by and large do not represent their own people, and that's another problem that we're not discussing here, but which I think is well worth discussing.\", 'negotiating, you were dealing with the Syrians, I was dealing with -', '', \"of failure in Palestinian Israeli peace making. And counter to the views of  what you just heard this is centrally important in the Middle East. You should vote for this proposition because it would stop the United States for enabling Israel in its worst habits of occupation and settlement, things that harm United States harm of course Palestinians but also harm Israel. Most importantly, you should vote for the proposition because it would help to bring peace and would be in the U.S. national interest. I've said that if you do not vote for this proposition you are voting for the status quo. More process no peace. Now that is not the status quo that is stable, that is a status quo it is evolving, I would suggest in a fashion not favorable to I think most of the interests that most of us share. Let me read quote briefly, as long as in this territory west of the Jordon there is only one political entity called Israel. It is going to be either non Jewish or non democratic. Speaker continued if this block of millions of Palestinians cannot vote this will become an apartheid state. This was not some anti-Semitism; this is not some Israel passer; this is Defense Minister of State of Israel, Ehud Barak speaking on the 3rd of February at Herzliya. That is status quo that is where it is going. It is in - ultimately a decision for the Israelis to take where they want to go, but we enable this, that is why you should vote for this proposition. And let me conclude by saying something about Iran. If Israel attacks Iran, in a situation where this special relation is unmodified, imagine if you will the impact on U.S. interests, on U.S. troops in Iraq, on the U.S. position in the Gulf and the Gulf itself. Now if this relationship remains unchanged, if United States is perceived as the hand maiden, the guardian, the enabler, of everything that Israel does we will be responsible when and if that catastrophic things happens. If Iran is a problem for the region not just for Israel, but it is not a problem to be resolved in the way that a lot of Israelis are pushing us to resolve it. That is why among many other reasons you should vote for the proposition.\"]\n",

      "['On a tatami mat, in the lotus position, thats true.', 'Im willing to prove it.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  California is the first failed state, and most of you probably believe that already. Which is a tactical disadvantage for us on this side, but if you do, we want to keep your vote.  For the rest of you, wed like to convince you of that this evening.   And, before I start doing that, I just want to clear away something that might be confusing.  The proposition is cheeky, as all of you know, all good Oxford-style debates start with a cheeky proposition.   The reason this one is cheeky, is that failed states usually refer to sovereign states. Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Haiti.  And what those have in common, is that they have lost a monopoly on legitimate violence, if you think that through, or maybe back to Poli. Sci.   When that happens, warlords take over or maybe Somalian pirates, and the state as such loses authority, well clearly, no one on the stage tonight is going to argue in the next two hours that California is already ruled by warlords or pirates.   So what are we talking about when we talk about one of the 50 states, domestic states. We have to agree to a working definition to make this interesting. California and other domestic states that may follow have failed, if they fail to support their citizens and instead hinder them. Whats another way of saying that is, if a state, if the governance part of the state as opposed to private industry, can no longer address or solve the problems it faces, then it has failed. California easily meets those criteria.   And I just want to quickly because that timer is running already, run down some of the problems to remind you, maybe we can go into them later in depth.  Prisons, California has the worst recidivism rate in the country, how did it get like that.   Water, its an infrastructure and a climate issue but its also a political, a governance issue. Education.  Before California became a failed state in the Pat Brown era of the 50s and 60s it built the best public university system in the country, it is currently dismantling that because it is now a failed state.   Budgets.  And a state is supposed to have a budget, to pass it on time, California never does, that started well before the recession.  Californiaor states are supposed to pay their bills to their vendors and so forth, as all of you know, probably all of you know, California has been paying with I.O.U.s.  Courts.  I asked Ronald George, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, whether he thought it was a failed state, he could say [sic] you could argue that, if the state no longer administers justice because its courts are closed part of the time, and dockets of cases is backlogged.  California has the worst credit rating of the 50, you know that, it was just lowered again by S&P.   Our opponents may try to convince you tonight that this has something to do with the Great Recession, and that as soon as theres a recovery these problems will recede.  Its not true, all of you have heard Warren Buffett say its only when the tide goes out when you learn whos swimming naked. [LAUGHTER]   California has been undressing since the 1970s, I hope to get into that.  I argue that its been stark naked since the 90s, and indeed, the tide has just now gone out with the Great Recession but thats not something that happened overnight, the failure that is, the nakedness.  Its just been revealed.   Our opponents may also argue that California has problems, but all states have problems, as Mr. Rosenkranz reminded you here. And that that does not amount to failure, thats not true, thats not appropriate in the case of California, because only one state has all problems simultaneously.  And when you have all problems simultaneously you tie them together into a straitjacket and thats what California is in, its in a straitjacket, because of its governance structures.  I want to develop that in the time that remains right now a little bit, and then hopefully go deeper into it later in the evening to show to you what the unique aspect of that confluence is.   Unique number 1.  Three states, for example, have the super-majority requirement that both houses of a legislature have two-thirds votes to pass a budget, three states. Arkansas, Rhode Island, and California, nothing unusual yet.  16 states have the same super-majority required to raise taxes. Only one state has both.  How did California California is that state.  How did California get that second super-majority requirement.  It was the infamous Prop 13, I understand its famous even on this coast1978 when they started undressing. It is part of something called direct democracy that the founders of the nation, as opposed to the state, were very skeptical and afraid ofabout, afraid of.  It includes initiatives, referenda and recalls.  24 states have initiatives, have direct democracy.   Only one does not allow its legislature, to amend initiatives that its own voters have passed, no matter how insane.  Only one state, only one state has the process, has really run certifiably amok, out of control, insane, in only one state, do the inmates run the asylum.   Tonight, you may hear that California, this usually comes up, has great weather.  You may hear about its beautiful redwoods, Yosemites gorgeous.  You may hear about the vibrancy of Silicon Valley which I used to cover.   All that is true, its all irrelevant.  Because were not talking about whether or not the state has assets.  Whether or not there are some good things in the state.  Of course there are.   Were talking about whether the state as such, the structures that make the state, the governance structures, have failed, and indeed they have, and the other states must be very careful unless they have the same uniquethe same combination of problems that put them in the same straitjacket, and also lead to failure.   Our opponents are great oratorsdont let them confuse you tonight  [LAUGHTER] Ill be back in a little, in a few minutes, but for now just remember what the definition of a domestic failed state is, remember to stay on our side, stay on our side, you probably are there already.  California is the first failed state.', 'Well, in particular, Governor Gray Davis was making that point. I wrote down a direct quote from you, Governor, In California, the private sector is the envy of the world.  The public sector is on the mend.  You asked me, Whats wrong with the logic of the first part?  And in fact, I would like to do that, and the second part as well. And we examined the first part, and go and take a larger period of historya few hundred years.  The most elegant leather shoes come from a town nearly Bologna in northern Italy.  The best violins come from another town in northern Italy.  Thats been that way for hundreds of years.  Would you honestly make the case?  Would you have made the case for much of post-war history that Italy was not a failed state in the European Union because they had a great shoe industry and a great violin industry [LAUGHTER] in the northern Italy?', 'It is irrelevant.  The other pointjust briefly.  You cannot seriously say that the public sector is on the mendat the very moment when they are dismantling entire government programs that were intended to protect the weakest.  And people are literally going to die, certain old people at home, because home visits are stopping.', 'They are in Nevada and Arizona', 'and especiallyif you want to talk about the green economy look to Denmark, China, Israel', 'Yeah, and its not in California', 'Actually, I limit it to the United States.', 'Well, one state.  [LAUGHTER]', 'Sure.  So if you say [LAUGHTER], if you want to change it to California is dead  And I can tell you we are not debating that, and we are not arguing it', 'What we are  By the way, I agree that failureas you saidis an occasional stop.  I happen to be writing a book at the moment about how failure and success are imposters.  But you have to be honest that a failure has occurred, in order to fix it.  Californians are honest about itthats why they will pass the two initiatives that will call for a constitutional conventionjust as Americans, after the Revolutionary War, called a constitutional convention because the Articles of Confederation were a failure, and they accepted that and admitted that first, and then you start fresh. So you need to admit honestly that a failure has occurredthen you move on, move on. A few  Just a little bit of mopping up.  About the public universities.  What is the still remaining excellence of the university system a sign of?  Its a sign of the Pat Brown legacy, when California was not a failed state.  What are they dismantling?  I wrote a story about this.  I asked professors and the president of the UC system.  A professor at UC Santa Cruz of astrophysics told methe excellence is being lost in her department as we speak because of the budget cuts.  The people she was hiring to be good professors have defected because they know there is nowhere for them to go in their careers.  They are going to more competitive, private or other public universities in the state and world.  So dont get confused about this public university.  It was a sign of something working well 30 years ago  And you are  You will seewhen its gonethat something failed today.', 'First of all I have to say I agree exactly with you, youvebecause you lived there and because you came from outside as I did you saw that direct democracy is a large part of the problem.  Part of it is confusion over the word democracy, James Madison didnt want it even used in the constitution of the country, because he was afraidthey had studied ancient Athens which was a failure because of direct democracy.   They had studied Republican Rome, which was very stable, they wanted Rome, not Athens. Fast forward to a century ago, the Progressive era.   Californians and other western states introduced direct democracy because they were afraid of corruption by the Southern Pacific Railroad of the young state California, they wanted direct democracies, voter directly passing legislation, as a safeguard, as a fourth branch of government to be used sparingly as in Switzerland which was their model.   Fast forward again to Prop 13, and onward, and you have a circus, earlier I said, an asylum that is run by the inmates.  Never mind the attack ads, the demagoguery  Here is the word count of the longest initiative, 15,633 words.   Thatsit is, there was a, I remember driving in the car when several propositions were decided last year.  An English teacher called in and said shes not able to understand the initiatives in the ballot on grounds of syntax.   Thats number one, people vote for double negatives when they think theyre voting for the triple negative. [LAUGHTER]  There is, it is in Californiathis is not a statement against representative democracy as the founding fathers of the nation said.   Imthis is a statement against direct democracy as practiced in California, where the legislature is hobbled, because it cannot amend initiatives, and it is unique in that respect.  In California it is the least informed way of making decisions.   Other people have said tonight, it is curious how often the tough-on-crime voters vote for longer prison terms but forget the taxes to pay for larger prisons.  Vote for faster trains, for smaller school classes, for all these things and somehow forget, not only to vote for the taxes, but then also vote for Prop. 13 so that they cant even be raised.', 'Passed by initiative.', 'Sophistry.', 'He just made a', 'You just heard a great answer if you were wondering whether you should buy municipal bonds in California then you might. Rememberbecause, its true, technically, legally a state cannot go bankrupt.   [01:35:25:18]   The order of payments is indeed correct.  Remember that California has the worst credit rating of the 50 statesthat is a superlative.  It has just been lowered to one notch above junk, by the time this debate is over it probably is junk, so  [LAUGHTER]   Even in the order of payments that youve just heard which was correct, it may indeed go, you know, the bonds may indeed default, which we dont even need to prove, to carry our motion.', 'I dont want to summarize it because, I dont think I need to, I want to say thank you to you, sir, for focusing our, our attention again on the proposition that youre now deciding in this binary way, California is the First Failed State, you wanted me to focus on is and first.   California is the first failedfailed state means simply that tonight as we speak it is a failure.  It does not mean that, five years from now, it cannot have made a fresh start.  In fact, the most important prerequisite for making a fresh start and insuring, just as it came up earlier-- in Pat Browns day, California was not a failure, today it is.   Things can change, however, you have to take a a vital step first.  You have to admit that something has failed for you to change it.  This is sort of a microcosm of two organizations in California, one called California Forward, one called Repair California.   The names will tell you nothing what they stand for, one wants to deny that the failure is fundamental and wants to fiddle, wants to fiddle here, fiddle there, muddle along, and hope that itll get better, the other is Repair California which is the organization now pushing the initiatives for the constitutional convention.   They want you to say that the failure is fundamental, and therefore we need a new constitution because ours is unmanageably complex, with 500 amendmentsin half the time that it took Americas constitution to have 27 amendments, all because of initiatives.   The people of California will pass those initiatives calling for a constitutional conventionin any poll, opinion poll that you may now read. And that is because the people of California take it for granted, they just assume, there is a consensus that the failure is as of today, in fact there, that California has failed, and that we must start fresh with a new constitution, to prevent it, finally, first simply means, the other states, the other 49 have to watch out so they dont repeat our mistakes.']\n",
      "['Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  I also want to put in a plug for Red, which I started also with my great colleague, Bono, my partnerwhich I always like saying.  Because most of my life, people have been saying other things about me.  I was President Kennedys nephew.  When my dad started the Peace Corps, I was Sergeant Shrivers son.  When my mom started the Special Olympics, I was Eunice Shrivers son.  And then a terrible thing happened in our familymy sister went on national television and became the host of the CBS Morning News.  So four brothers, very competitive Irish family, were faced with the prospect that we were going to be known forever as Maria Shrivers brothers.  [LAUGHTER]  So we had a meetingwhat could we do about it?  And we had various ideas, none of them very good.  And at one point, one of my brothers said, Well, face it, you know, its done, and it cant get any worse.  And then Maria got married.  [LAUGHTER]  So, I love it when I go and see in the program that I am Bonos partner, because I am really tired of being Arnold Schwarzeneggers brother-in-law. [LAUGHTER] I appreciated our eloquence of some of our colleagues, but I want to point out very, very specifically that all of the answers are on the way.  They are not here now.  And I can tell you in local government, where I serve on the City Council in Santa Monica, that things are bad.  We are lucky in Santa Monica because we have a great, diverse tax base.  But just to give you a couple of illustrations  Our redevelopment agency had a budget this year of 30 million dollarsthe state took 22 million of that.  How can you work on that basis?  And this is a reminder also, that when you talk about the state, you are not talking about Google and Inteland you are not talking about local governmentyou are talking about the state government.  Its very important.  The state is a constitutional entity, its a legal entity.  Its not California.  When Steve Jobs writes on every Apple product, designed in California, assembled in China, he is not talking about designed in the State House of Californiahe is talking about in the culture of California, which I think we all agree is the greatest culture in America and maybe in the world. [APPLAUSE]  Thank you.  There are local Californias in the culture. Think about it.  Right now  A good interesting point, segue, Ill go to your idea.  There is no art education in the state in the public schools.  We are the last in the state, in all of the 50 states.  We are below Guam in arts education. MAN IN AUDIENCE Wow. BOBBY SHRIVER I am serious.  I mean, its  Its kind of a little funny, but its hard to believe really  And thats a state responsibility.  The money is not there.  Why is the money not there?  Because the people have lost confidence in the government obviously. Ill give you another example.  In Los Angeles, we have the biggest homeless population in America, 80,000-plus people.  The L.A. County Jail is the largest mental health facility in the worldin the world.  If you go there, every single one of youI dont care what your background or point of view on this debate would be would be sickened to see whats going on in there.  There is a famous quote from the, uh, I think its Hammerati [PH] who said, The purpose  One of the purposes of government is to protect the weak from the strong.  We have completely failed.  You go in that L.A. County Jail and you will see the weakest people in our societymentally ill people living in cagesthere are 14 full-time pharmacists to medicate themin Downtown L.A. Of the 85 or some-odd thousand people that are homeless, about a third are veterans.  We have a 400-acre property in West L.A. in Westwoodthat have empty buildings in itwhich were built as mental institutions for veterans that are emptyand have been empty for more than 20 years.  Why is that?  The state hasnt cooperated with the feds to fix that I dont knowI cant come here and give you an answer.  I have been trying to fix it for the last five years, and so far I have failed.  Although President Bush and Secretary Nicholson did designate three of the buildings for homeless veteranswhich is a positive thing.  And I understand that one of the answers on the waythere is 50 million dollars in the new defense appropriations bill for that building, which would be a great thing.  But the fact that people burnt  And in my little ol Santa Monica, a man burnt to death in a dumpstera homeless man, burnt to death in a dumpster several months agois unacceptable. And you would say, well, that, you  as a senior official of the state said to me, Well, Bob, you know, you gotta calm down. You know, you gotta  You are very hopped up about this homeless thing.  And he said, Why are you so hopped up about it?  I said, I am afraid my momGod bless her and God rest her soulis going to hear that a homeless guy burnt to death in a dumpster in my jurisdictionwhich is what she used to call it, my jurisdiction, not my constituency.  [LAUGHTER]  Because she would be enraged. So, going on to the kinds of things that Sharon said.  The public communitywhich is really the primary goal of the statenot to get too esoteric about itbut to have a kind of political compassion for people does not exist.  You cant have that many homeless peopleyou cant have the underfunding of education that existsyou cant have that many homeless veteransand say that the state has been successful in creatingamongst its citizensa concept of political compassion.  That we are going to get together  We have community interests.  We are going to get together and we are going to do something about them.  And ideas are on the way  And green tech, great.  Its all fantastic. For the least of these, its not fantastic in California.  Its really not. Ill give you another examplea local example.  The City of Beverly Hills has a school system, Santa Monica has one.  The state is organizing school districts like that.  They had kids from out of the City of Beverly Hills in that district, because the state used to payand still maya certain amount per student.  So you would bring people from out of your district who were not there and educate them.  They changed that formula recently, and what did Beverly Hills do?and they are not bad people they expelled all those kids.  Why?  We are not getting paid for it anymore.  Thats a state failurenot a Beverly Hills failure, not a failure of those communities. So as you think about how you are going to vote, its very important to say  And I like to be optimisticand I am optimistic.  When they asked me, which side of this debate did I want to be on, I said I wanted to be on this one.  And they said, well, dont you want to be on the optimistic side?  I said, this is the optimistic side.  [LAUGHTER]  This is the optimistic side. Because if you dont know that the problem is as bad as it isif you dont go to the L.A. County Jail and see thatyou think and I mean this respectfullythat help is on the way.  Help is not on the way.  We, this yearIll give you one final example.  The CalPERSthe pension charged to little, to citiesgoing up 25 percent.  In our budget, thats a breaker, you know?  So it has nothing to do, as I saidI am repeating myselfwith Googleit has to do with, can you run the trains on time?  Thank you.

The real harsh truth Im afraid is that voters do not put the initiatives on the ballot. Theres anin fact a huge industry, which are in effect sort of semi-private legislatures   You really have to think about that. There are people who are very well-financed, may not even live in California, who can hire teams of people, which is a business, a big business, to write legislation for the state.  Theyve had every conceivable, you all probably know, ridiculous things that have been put on and defeated.   And some ridiculous things have been passed because people as Andreas was saying, cant figure out the syntax, Im a lawyer, and I cant figure out some of them, the book that comes to you when you vote is that big, and youre expected to read in very fine print those documents.   And the correlative to this idea is the deprofessionalization honestly of the legislature itself which is to some extent the function of the term limits law which is going to be extended', 'Indeed.  But the point there is that you have these permanent, semi-private, or entirely private groups of people, whose business it is every year, to make law for the state, who', 'No, and I want to say a second thing now that I hear Vans dulcet tones.

Because, and I appreciate also Sharons seriousness about this matter, I mean weve had a little fun, which is great.  But the truth is tonight, at this moment, people are suffering in really unimaginable ways, and this is a pretty wealthy crowd, a powerful crowd, were here in New York, its all good.   The people that the government and the sense of political compassion is created to serve are really, really bad in California.  Calworks that Gray mentioneds about to be defunded entirely.  The reason that we have a lot of homeless in people is not because LA is big as Lawrence suggested.   Its because the policies of the state, dont work. Mental health financing is with the county, housing is with the city.  They dont work together, they havent worked.  Theres been no progress made, enormous progress has actually been made in New York, on homelessness.  Despite what other things New York hasnt done well.   I want to reiterate, were the optimistic people, were not moaning and groaning.  Were not, oh, woe is us, California doesnt have a lot of brilliant people, a lot of venture capital, a lot of cool companies, we acknowledge all that.   Were not talking about that, were talking about the state which is a revenue-collection mechanism.  It disperses money to people, to do things that the community wants done.  If that isnt happening, the state, not the people, not our energy, not our optimism, not our tools, none of that, is relevant.   Its a revenue- collection thing based on principles.  We are not collecting and distributing the revenue to the most vulnerable people in the state today by an immense margin.  The sufferinghere, is immense.  And thats  why you have to vote, to give a wake-up call, to the people who hold the power in the state and the people of California, so that they can feel comfortable to say you know what, were optimistic, were going to get it done, but we got a problem.']\n",
      "['Yeah, I like the weather.', 'So before I get going I just want to know if Gray Daviss relatives are going to get to vote this evening?  [LAUGHTER]  If theyre filling half the room.  I come to you tonight as a mother, as an engaged citizen, and as a journalist who has covered California for the past 15 years.  So lets start with the area I know best that I deal with every day and thats Hollywood.  Hollywood, the symbol, a signature of California.   Part of the dream of what California represents.  And a symbol of course to the world of Californias industry, creativity, prosperity, and the values of American culture.  Heres the only problem with that. Hollywoods not really in Hollywood anymore.  Its gone to New Mexico, and Arizona, and New York, and Vancouver, and London. So Avatar, the movie that is now breaking all the box-office records was really filmed in New Zealand.  And Twilight, that series that all your kids, all your daughters are going to see was filmed in Vancouver, and Harry Potter, that series of extremely successful movies was filmed in London.  So the people who run the industry, which is a fairly small number of people,  they still live in Brentwood and Bel Air and Beverly Hills and places like that but the hundreds and thousands of jobs that produce this, juggernaut ofnot just of jobs but of tax revenues to the state, has largely fled, film production is down to half of what it was in California in 1996.   This is the way things are going, and the reason for me it has a lot to do with California failing to create a sense of connectedness with this incredibly core industry, its so much of what we ought to be proud of, by the way of course the entertainment industry is one of Americas top exports, not only California.  But it doesnt feel like that there is a connection between what the state represents, and the identification that we have with Hollywood and that vast entertainment industry, with the state, and why is that.   It seems to me that the state has neglected it as it has neglected so many things.  And that goes to me to sortone of the, one of my big observations about living in California especially after having lived around the world for much of the beginning of my adult life, is that there isnt that sense of connectedness, as a community.   And the state plays a big role in that.  Where we live in California, is largely in gated communities, with private security, we live in isolation, and this is nothing new, we all know that.  People, you can go to a place like Koreatown which has the largest ethnic community of Koreans outside of Korea, 800,000 people.   That community feels extremely Korean.  They feel extremely connected to the country of their parents birth or of their birth or of their ancestors.  I dont think they feel Californian.  And I think that thats true of so many of the ethnic groups that have come to live in enclaves in California.   I see that as a failure of the state to create that sense of identity among them.  Heres another big thing that bothers me.  People who know me know that this is my pet peeve.  The state has not provided an infrastructure that allows us to be a community, and community is all about what the state is there to protect, and preserve, and to nourish.   So I cant tell you how many times I have driven up to the edge of the 10 freeway from where I live in Santa Monica, peered over the railing, hoping to go to a Lakers game, or to visit a museum, or to go visit Disney Hall for the first time which I would have never succeeded in doing when they were actually playing a concert, and, dared to jump into that essential parking lot of the 10 freeway.   Thats because, there isnt a transportation system that works.  We are essentially a city that sits on the roads, and that we have of course made a decision not to have a public transportation of any significance, and the roads are long- neglected and the state has not invested in them,  to me, that is, as a member of-- somebody who wants to participate in the community, I feel I cant get to the community, and that to me is a failure of the state.  Finally, I want to speak to you as a mother. Im the mother of three children.   And I moved my family from Europe actually, to raise them in California, and we all, all of us in our family, my husband and I and kids who were then small, were aware of what it meant to go pursue the California dream. That dream has really turned out to be one that we have to create for ourselves.  We came from Europe where public transport was something that was a given.  Medical care was a given, education was a given.  At the very least, I knew that coming to California, that I was moving to a state that had the best public university system in the country, if not the world.   Today, that system has been, I feel, taken away from us.  Because of the problems with the state, they just, again, you probably all read about it, raised the fees some 30 percent in the UC system, and, theyre now approaching the fees of a private university, it now costs about the same to go to UCLA Law Schoolmy son the lawyer, Im just still hoping[LAUGHS] as it is to go to a private law school.  How is it that the state is abdicating its role in creating a generation of the best and the brightest in the state of California, which was all about what California represented.  Soall of this together, leads me to say to you, that California is a failed state.  I commend the governor on all of the changes that hes laying out as hoping to come to California, and, as an entrepreneur having started The Wrap.com, I can tell you that there are wonderful companies thereand I chose to start my company in California, however, that doesnt mean that that is because the state encourages us to do so or allows us to do so, that is a testament to the innovation that the citizens and the residents of California have shown.  It is not proof that the state has not failed.  And so I would like you to vote for the proposition that California is the first failed state.   It has neglected its fundamental industries, it has neglected its fundamental functions, and it has neglected its fundamental values as a state.', 'Governor, did you say 60 million?', 'or 60 billion?  I just want to point out', 'Yeah, I had a question.  ExxonMobil, you say was 60 million dollars in San Diego?', '600 million dollars', 'Right, OK.  So the last quarterly statement for ExxonMobil, they were  Their profits were in the multiple billions of dollars.  So in terms of their investments  And thats a small multiple for', 'for a company like', 'But when you have a student revolt for this', 'Thats true.', 'No, thats  [LAUGHTER]  Exactly.', 'I would like, I would like to start', 'Oh yeah.  I would like to not respondI would like to ask  And clean tech is  And we keep hearing clean tech, clean tech How about the industry that I brought upHollywoodwhere that is, that is just the subject of the most egregious neglect in the years that I have been covering the industry.  This is a huge amount of money that the state has just allowed to leave.  And only this past year has there been the tiniest, too little too late measure to keep it togetherby passing a small fraction of the kinds of measures that other states have already had in place for years to incentivize productions to stay in the state.  Thats money  Thats not money thats out there to be created, as clean tech is a future and building, an economy of where we are goingits an industry thats there, that the state has allowed to slip through its fingers, and has never actually created a sense ofas I keep using that wordconnection between the people Yeah, how?  I mean, California invented the motion picture industry.  It created  It invented the entertainment industry. How is it possible that it has been allowed to slip away?', 'Thats absolutely false', 'and you know it.  [LAUGHTER]  The taxes   Thats completely empirically false.  Canada, London, 20 percent tax credits, its not the artists who make the decisions as you know, Dick Wolf is an exception, hes not the artist in that case, hes the executive producer.   But its the producers and its the people who sign the checks who decide where these jobs go. [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'Are you, are you really defending the', 'the legislative system', 'theand the initiative system, really', 'No, I think, I  [LAUGHTER]  Not at all, I', 'Were clearly saying, from a position of people who live in California, who believe in California, whove spentwho have decided to spend our lives there, that California is currently a failed state, it makes me very sad to hear the other side of the panelgiving, paying truly lip service to the notion that yeah, it has some problems.   Talkthats about the understatement of this century, this early part of the century or the new decade.  If you live in California and you read the news every day, it is a litany of failures, rogue laws, gridlocks, budget  Pick your billion, 20 billion this week, 30 billion last threesix months ago, whatever the hole is that has to be filled, the latest service to be cut, the latest milk and cookies that will not be served.  It is this is the lives of the people of the state of California, its not a joke.  Its not, how bad is New York or how bad is Arkansas.  It isthis is where we are spending our lives, and for us to be arguing this, it is because we believe that California does hold the promise of being the greatest state in the nation, not because we believe it is irredeemably failed and cannot be saved.   But to hear people who are in our government, on the other side of, of the panel, suggesting that its all cheer, cheery and roses, is very disheartening I have to say for me as a resident of the state, the state is stuck.   And it is not working, and if you live there, and if you pay attention at all, you have to know that.', 'You do?', '[LAUGHS]  Im so touched', 'But youll still vote for our side', 'Well, I believe the other side has actually made our point this evening.  Theyve said that California is full of innovative people, its full of ideas, its culture is rich, that invention is still vibrant in the state and the lifestyle is beautiful.  All of that is true and thats why we all choose to live there.   But all of that is despite the fact that the state has failed.  And its not becand we stay there for all those reasons because, we continue to push forward, but not because the state lends a hand, plays its role in providing education, transportation, security, a prison system, a medical system, the things that are the state.   That is what were here to talk about tonight, it is a very serious matter for those of us who live and who have engaged our lives in the state.  And to hear Van say that we are coming together in ways that are extraordinary, it sounds really lovely, I have no idea what that means.  [LAUGHTER]   Were not coming together, and theres nothing extraordinary about whats happening to California as a state except extraordinarily bad, Im sad to say.  So I ask you all to vote for this proposition as a gesture, of not only that we have proved the case, but as a gesture of helping take the step of consciousness, and of moving California toward the right future, which is not the path that its on.']\n",

      "['Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  First off I want to make clear that I understand that some of Professor Castanedas students are in the auditorium.  And I think its very important to reiterate and remind you that your vote is secret at the end of this, so [LAUGHTER]   Your grades will not be affected by coming to the right side here.  And I want to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation for holding this debate.  As John mentioned, I grew up in Mexico in the 1970s, in the northern state of Chihuahua, and the capitol city of the same name.  And back then it was a pretty easygoing mid-size city.   My friends and I wouldnt really think twice about hitchhiking home from school, or hopping on a city bus to go downtown to watch a movie, then grab a taco at our favorite hole-in-the-wall joint, [SPANISH NAME].   Our parents didnt really worry much about us then.  I dont mean to suggest that Chihuahua was Denmark.  The state does sit on the border with the United States.  And while the bulk of the hard drug trade in those days as Fareed mentioned, went through the Caribbean, there were plenty of trafficking organizations in the mountains of Chihuahua near the city.   But we werent really aware of this, there was no violence, I didnt even know anyone who did drugs.  I got my first exposure to the consumer end of the pipeline when I came to school in the States.  And its actually important to make clear that, contrary to something that was suggested earlier, consumption rates in Mexico still remain very low and thats something we can explore later in the debate.   The state of Chihuahua only became a bloody battleground, its border city of Ciudad Juarez synonymous practically with murder, after the US clamped down on the Caribbean routes via Miami once favored by the cartels.   And that is what transformed Mexico into the global hub of the trade for drugs.  I was talking to a childhood friend recently in Chihuahua and he told me that the city bears little resemblance to the place that we grew up in, and that he doesnt dare now leave his kids out of sight.   Lest they be kidnapped or caught in the crossfire between the cartels, or between the cartels and the security forces.  I am proud I grew up in Mexico, and Im even more proud to be an American. Which is why its doubly painful for me to acknowledge that America is responsible for whats happened to Chihuahua, and that America is to blame for Mexicos drug war.   The United States cannot continue to have it both ways.  We Americans need to make a choice.  Either we get serious about clamping down on the consumption of illegal drugs, or we should legalize them.  Wherever you come down on the moral health, economic merits of criminalizing versus legalizing drugs, please acknowledge that a continuation of the hypocritical status quo, which criminalizes socially accepted behavior, undermines the rule of law, both in our country, and in countries overrun by the goons who arbitrage between our supposed morality, and our actual behavior.   That may all sound a bit abstract.  Whats a little erosion of the rule of law between friends.  Until you start counting the corpses piling up south of the border.  They are closing in on 15,000 just since President Caldern took office in late 2006.  And thats nearly three times the number of US servicemen killed in Iraq and Afghanistan this decade.   So lets not be distracted by talk of corruption in Mexico or what percentage of guns in Mexico comes from where.  Our debate isnt about whether Mexico is like Denmark, or about Americas gun laws.  It is about what happens to a nation that shares a 2,000-mile border with the richest nation on earth when that richest nation on earth insists on consuming some $65 billion worth of drugs a year, and insists on ceding control of that market, of that industry, to offshore criminal organizations.  Theres an old saying in Mexico, perhaps youve heard it.   Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the United States.  [LAUGHTER]  But the real curse isnt merely proximity to America.  Its being sandwiched between Americas insatiable demand for illicit drugs, and the sources of the most valuable of those drugs, the coca fields in Colombia and Bolivia.  So lets not be confused.  Whatever Mexicos shortcomings are, and there are plentyand say Canadas virtues, whatever those are   If our two neighboring countriestraded places, wed be here talking about a Canadian war tonight.  Geography sometimes is destiny.  As Americans we believe in individual empowerment and the concept that our actions have consequences.   As consumers we may shun products that harm the environment, maybe you buy fair-trade coffee.  You know, we believe that our choices have consequences.  On college campuses students have long thought globally but acted locally.  You know, they mobilize against overseas sweatshops   Or they press institutions to to divest from investments that may harm people in Darfur or elsewhere.  When I was in college in the States, the issue of the day was divestment from South Africa.  Activists erected shantytowns on campus to pressure the college to stop investing in companies that were doing business there.  Again, a laudable impulse.  But even then I was struck by how some of these activists disregarded their socially responsible investment creed, when it came to recreational drugs.   Their cash after all was underwriting the murder of elected officials, judges, and policemen in Colombia.  As Fareed said back then that was the hub, and now its shifted to Mexico.  And I do worry that we still havent made that connection.   I actually shared this view with a girlfriend at the time in college, as an argument for our not indulging, and that may have hastened the demise of our relationship.  [LAUGHTER]  She didnt quite call me Buzzkill Martinez but maybe she did and Ive omitted that memory.  [LAUGHTER]   I must say though, President Obama to his credit has acknowledged this nexus.  Saying that as the ultimate consumers of the drugs flowing north, we have a shared responsibility with Mexico in confronting its war.  So we should count him as a member of our team here tonight. [LAUGHTER]   And even Ronald Reagan back in 1988 meeting with President de la Madrid said similar things, that the solution to the problem was for Americans to quit buying illegal drugs.  And I would suggest another option, as has been suggested, is decriminalization.  But we cant continue to have it both ways.   I recently read a best-selling book in Mexico by an author I respect a great deal, and from whom Ive learned a lot.  And on page 85 of that book, he wrote that the US wants Mexico to wage the war and provide the corpses, so it doesnt have to.   And he refers to the US as exporting its internal conflict on drugs.  The author of this book, and Im sorry, Jorge, to pile on, but  [LAUGHTER]  Youre such prolific writer.  [LAUGHTER]  The book is excellent.  Is Jorge Castaneda of course, and, theres still time, Jorge, for you to switch sides and come over to  [LAUGHTER]  to join us and Presidents Obama and Reagan.  [LAUGHTER]  But I look forward to continuing this conversation, and thank you so much for your interest. [APPLAUSE]', 'Can I butt in on that too  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'All right', 'Yeah, first off, I think Asa is twisting the proposition a bit by bringing it back constantly to the American government. America is to Blame for Mexicos Drug War, the America there is, is a larger entity, its all of society.  There are government policies but theres also individual behavior and societal norms, and the disconnect between our laws and our behavior.   And as a good Republican I would think that you wouldnt necessarily always equate America with the American government.  [LAUGHTER]  I think the dynamic  [APPLAUSE] The dynamic here is theres a pattern of behavior in terms of that this bilateral relationship.   Where the United States historically has seen Mexico as a kind of back-yard Las Vegas where, the usual rules dont apply, what happens in Mexico can stay in Mexico.  So we can export our, our unresolved contradictions down there.   People in Mexico are bearing the burdens of our conflict on drugs, and the fact that we have dysfunctional laws, its Mexicans doing the dying for our unresolved  We cant bear as a society to go without these drugs, but we also cant bring ourselves to legalize them. And', 'whats the cost of this', 'I dont', 'I didnt have an opportunity to talk about the  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'Well youre also trying to twist the proposition into making it Americas Gun Laws are to Blame for Mexicos Drug War.  I think theres a broader issue here, I mean I would follow the money, not necessarily the guns.  There are an awful lot of American guns making their way to Mexico.  However, it is true, that if youre making $20-30 billion in the United States because American society has decided that this one industry that it doesnt want to go away is going to be ceded to criminal organizations, you would be able to buy those guns elsewhere, I will grant you that.   If the United States had the toughest gun control laws in the entire worldthe Mexican drug cartels would still be armed to the teeth.  What theyre really getting out of the United States, first and foremost, is guns, the fact that its very convenient for them to pick up guns while theyre here tallying up their profits, that just adds insult to injury.', 'I totally agree that the issue is the rule of law but its the rule of law in this country, its our failure to uphold the rule of law that is to blame for Mexicos drug war.  We are the ones with an addiction rate of illicit drugs thats six times higher than in Mexico.  We are the ones who are abusing this stuff, but cant bring ourselves to legalize it, and its people in Mexico who are dying for that.   We as a society, and I dont think--you can be agnostic about whether or not drugs should be legalized, if that were the subject, the proposition tonight, Im not sure which side I would be on.  You can be agnostic on that, and still recognize the, the basic fact that the United States is to blame for the war on drugs.   And Im glad you mentioned immigration because you say, well, theyre diversifying into human trafficking.  Well geez, I wonder why, again.  Our failure to enact an immigration reform that matches supply and demand, again, weagain, back to my point about', 'Welllets think about this, we are as addicted to Mexican low-cost labor as we are to imported drugs', 'but we failbut we', 'But we cannot  [APPLAUSE]  But we cannot bring ourselves to create legal channels for that.  So either we have to decide, lets close down the border, not import low-cost labor, and its the similarits a parallel debate to whats happening on the drug front.', 'Your point about marijuana, 60 percent of the cartels profits come from marijuana', 'Well, I think its true that Mexico has, really undergone a tremendous transformation, its a poor country compared to the US but its actually, if you look at it in global terms, its a fairly successful, relatively successful middle-income country plodding along, its just a stark contrast that it shares a border with the US.  I think that the United States has opened up Mexicos economy through NAFTA and through other ways so, it probably has giventhe Mexican cartels have been able to take advantage of thatI dontI think its a little bit of a side issue to our main discussion here.   But if you think about Mexico becoming a logistical hub for this global enterprise, a lot of whats changed in Mexico has probably accelerated that and aided it.  But', 'But its  [LAUGHTER]  You know, I think just because its a lot easier for a lotta people in Mexico now to do business, likewise for the drug cartels, but I think this is a bit of a side issue.', 'I just want to very briefly take issue with Jorges repeated insistence that this war started in December of 2006.  Yes, President Caldern ratcheted up the effort, but as we have been discussing here tonight, this problem in Mexico specificallybut in the broader regions, the region more generallydates back many decades.  And even the year before Caldern took office in 2005, if you had been living in [UNCLEAR], you would feel there was a helluva war going on.  So I just wanted to make that clear.', '[LAUGHS, LAUGHTER]', 'A single woman or a married woman?', 'Thank you.  And again, I want to reiterate my appreciation for your being here and for the Rosenkranz Foundation for hosting this important forum. First off, I just quickly wanted to take issue again with Jorge on this question of whether the drug  war started under President Caldern.  And yes, there was a surge, if you willor a frontal declaration against all cartels, all the time, as you put it.  But I think the alternative  Its very cynical to say, Well, the government should have continued accommodating with these cartels.  And clearly, this day of reckoning was in the offing when sooner or later. But I think, again, America is to blame for the violence, for the war.  Asa Hutchinson said, We offered no facts, we offered no evidence.  I just point you again to a 65 billion dollar consumption demand for this, these illicit drugs in this country. I think the fact that we have spent so much time talking about whether or not to legalize is indicativeand again, I am agnostic on that questionbut I think its indicative that we all understand that the root cause here is the fact that we have this massive market in this country for a product that we have also made illegal.  65 billion dollars is more than 5 percent of Mexicos GDP.  According to Jorges fantastic book, Mexico has a consumptionillicit drug consumption ratesthat are below international averages.  Only 5 percent of Mexicans have ever tried illegal drugs, compared to 42 percent of Americans.  When I was a kid, they used to make stamps, Mexico Exporta, stamps of export products.  They could havemight as well made illicit drugs.  This is all about supply and demand.  Its all about supplying the American market.  90 percent of the cocaine that is consumed in this country now goes through Mexico, because of some of the shifts that Fareed mentioned earlier. We have to accept that our actions have consequences.  We cant constantly outsource the repercussions of our hypocrisy.  Please accept responsibility and vote with us that America is to blame for Mexicos drug war.']\n",
      "['Thank you very much, its very nice to be here, see so many people interested in this topic.  Let me start by responding very briefly to a few of things that Mr. Hutchinson said.  He said that in fact theres evidence that the war on drugs has been effective in reducing drug use, as he mentioned thats not really on point, thats not really the question.   But its also not correct.  Theres tons of evidence, and Im responsible for some of that evidence in my academic writing, on whether attempts to reduce consumption of drugs with prohibition are effective, and it universally finds little if any effect.   Yes, you can cherry-pick certain statistics to find that in some periods drug use went down, okay, but in other periods its gone up, or some other kind of drug use went up, the overall result is clearly no evidence for the efficacy of prohibition.   And note that over the last 40 years, we have dramatically ramped up our efforts to enforce prohibition, so we should have seen some effects if those effects were in any way going to be effective. Now turning to the proposition itself.  Is America to blame for Mexicos drug wars.   The answer is indisputably yes.  I want to argue it in three steps.  First, theres a fact already mentioned, that the US consumes a lot of drugs produced or trans-shipped through Mexico.  No one disputes that and thats clearly a part of the issue, but its not the whole issue, and its not the most important part of the issue, why, wellone, theres not really anything we can do about the fact that the US consumers choose to consume drugs.   Other countries consume some of the drugs from Mexico including Mexicans, including Canada or Europe, et cetera.  But it is a piece of the story and it is one sense in which you might say that the proposition that America is to blame, is correct.  But theres a much, much more important sense.   Why are there drug wars in Mexico.  Why is there violence in the drug trade in the US, and many other countries.  The reason there are drug wars is because the drug trade is prohibited.  Whether you think drugs should be legal or not, its an indisputable fact, based on theory and evidence, that when you drive a market underground, it becomes violent.   Why does it become violent?  Because participants in an underground market cannot resolve their disputes with courts, with lawyers, by complaining to the Consumer Product Safety Commission or things like that.  They can only resolve their disputes by shooting each other or by threatening to shoot each other.   We see evidence of this from all over history and all over the world. The US alcohol industry was not violent before 1920, when we passed alcohol prohibition.  It was then dramatically violent for 14 years, until we repealed alcohol prohibition, and then the trade became perfectly nonviolent just like any other legal good.   If we look at the history of prohibition of drugs, that trade was not violent until we prohibited drugs, and ramped up and escalated the war on drugs.  If you look at other commodities from gambling to prostitution to blue jeans supplied in controlled economies where they were in short supply, to commodities driven underground by high tax rates, whenever you drive a market underground, that market becomes violent because participants resolve their disputes with violence, okay, completely independent of the characteristics of the good, whether youre in favor or not of prohibiting that good, its just a fact of nature that the prohibition creates the violence.   Now the second thing to recognize is that the US, far and away above any other country, has historically and repeatedly and persistently been the country that has foisted prohibition on the entire world. Starting in 1919, in Paris, at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles which ended World War I, the US said it would not sign unless there was a clause in the treaty that required every other country to immediately go back and adopt drug prohibition.   This is in 1919.  Throughout the history of the United Nations the US has made fighting drugs and prohibiting drugs in particular a key part of the UNs mission. And very recently, the US has actively tried to push Canada, England, other countries, and in particular Mexico, to enforce drug prohibition and to adopt drug laws that we approve of. Let me read you some quotes that suggest someone else thinks this is right as well.  While every Mexican administration since the 60s has piously declared that it intended to intensify its drug enforcement efforts for domestic motivations, the fact is that the real reason has always been American pressure. Okay?  Quote one.  Quote two.  All this starts to show why current US drug policy would have to change in order for Mexico to change its stance.   It also explains why it is virtually impossible for Mexico to follow a different policy unilaterally. Okay?  So who wrote those words, suggesting that the US policy, the US insistence, the US pressure on Mexico, is the crucial factor, in determining Mexicos drug policy.   Well, it turns out its one of my opponents, Jorge Castaneda, in an article that I found on the Web a few days ago.  So I dont think that point, that the US has tried very, very hard, not always successfully, but has tried consistently, to make sure every country adopts drug prohibition--that point is just not beyond rational dispute.   So, part of the discussion here clearly is about what people think about legalization.  Ill comment on that in a second.  But you actually dont need to take a stand on whether its good to have drug legalization or drug prohibition, to take a view on the motion.   You should be in favor of the motion because its just a matter of science and the evidence, that the US pressure to enforce prohibition in Mexico and the US prohibition in the US, are the reasons for the drug violence.  Now some people may argue that violence is a cost of doing something thats worthwhile.   They may argue that prohibition reduces drug use, they may argue that drug prohibition has some other moral statement or something like that.  Many other people including me would argue that prohibition mainly does bad things, not only the violence but the corruption, the restrictions on medicinal uses of drugs for people who are suffering, the infringements on civil liberties and on and on.   Okay, and so you would think that for lots of reasons legalization is the right policy.  But you dont have to take a stand on that, regardless of your views on that, the correct position about the motion is that the US is indeed the single factor to blame for Mexicos drug wars.  Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]', 'I dont want to speak for others on that question', 'My  [LAUGHTER]  My position, separate fromindependent of this debate is that we should legalize all drugs.  I think the unity amongst the three of us although we probably differ in nuances of that view, is that,  [00:57:52:26]  unquestionably the magnitude of resources we devote to prohibition is grotesquely excessive, that the set of things that we prohibit is substantially excessive, that there may be a role for government to try to address the negatives associated with drug use, through treatment, through harm reduction, through various policies, but that the current practice of spending tens of billions, by my estimates about $80 billion a year, locking people up, to try to get rid of the drug trade, is an incredibly counterproductive policy and we should stop.', 'You just heard', 'Just heard Mr. Hutchinson say it that theyve only agreed with each other once so far this evening.  To go back to the gun point.  What Christopher Cox is arguing is that if you take a substance, a commodity, that a large number of people want to own, and you prohibit it, a whole bunch of consequences happen.   The market goes underground, it may shrink a bit, you may make it more costly, but its not going to disappear. Its going to go underground.  Then there will be corruption, as people try to evade those laws, there will be violence as people in the underground market resolve their disputes.   There will be poor quality control and so on and so forth.  Mr. Cox makes that argument, with respect to guns.  Okay, hes opposed to strenuous gun laws to prohibiting guns, but exactly the same arguments, apply to prohibiting drugs.   The structure of the argument, the logic of the argument, is totally compelling, and its right for both commodities, not just one, and not just the others, so libertarians think that guns should be legal, and drugs should be legal.  I hope that my opponent agrees with that proposition.', 'I dont think he said', 'Can Icould I respond to that, I mean', 'Throughout the last', '90 years', 'the drug prohibitionists have identified one', 'Yes.  Yes, because if you go back and read what people were writing in the 1950s', 'about marijuana.  They were saying things absolutely as strong, absolutely worse than what people are claiming now about crystal meth, if you look at the data on the', 'number of people who use crystal meth, theres zillions of people using it every day and a teeny fraction of them are doing the kinds of things that youre describing.   The drug prohibitionists for 90 years have constantly had a moving target, as soon as they identify one drug and say this is the killer drug, this is the one thats the most evil, this is the one thats going to destroy society.', 'And theres some violence', 'associated with trying to prohibit that', 'Well do you think', 'alcohol and tobacco are harmful drugs', 'The experience of US alcohol prohibition, was that the vast majority', 'of the illegal alcohol producers, became legal alcohol producers, and there was not a big surge in violence as they went into some other industry because initially there were not other industries that were highly prohibited for which they could make a lot of profit, they had to make an honest living in legal industries and the rates of returns were modest.', 'From trafficking in drugs, which were illegal.  [LAUGHTER]', 'Um  [LAUGHS]  Im actually more of a consequential libertarian than a rights-based libertarian, but we shouldnt probably get into that', 'Yeah.  [LAUGHTER]  But I think that your question can be phrased in one of two ways, one way some people think about this issue of drug use is to say, individuals have rights to consume what they want, to do what they want as long as theyre not harming innocent third parties.   A different way that people would say it is that, we should prohibit actions which negatively impact third parties without really using the word rights.  We should let them consume what they want because it makes them happy, we dont necessarily have to use those words, but they lead you to exactly the same positions.   Both the moral perspective and the sort of mundane, practical perspective.  We think about what the policies are, the policies have different consequences, and you can include morality as one of those sets of consequences.  But the libertarian position is we should look at all the sets of consequences, not just the feel-good consequencesnot just the alleged consequences, say eliminating drug use, which in fact doesnt happenwhen we decide whether to criminalize drugs.', 'There are certainly possibilities for reducing use of any substance that we legalize, relative to what you would get otherwise. Minimum purchase ages might have some effect, although the evidence suggests they have relatively minor effects.  A tax is almost certainly the most effective way, because that unambiguously raises the price.  But there are clearly limits to what you can do with the tax, because if you make the tax high, try to make the price really high, you drive the market back underground.  So the accurate view isyou can adjust how much people consume somewhat, but you cant fundamentally change the fact that people are going to use these substances. And whether you are getting the people you would like to discourage to stop using is much, much less clear.  In particular, by making it illegal, people who have no respect for the law are likely the ones who go ahead and consume it anyway.  The people who are likely the responsible usersthe ones who might do it in moderation were it legalare the ones who are deterred, so thats exactly backwards under a policy of Prohibition.', 'Again, thank you very much for being here and for listening.  Let me start by conceding some elements of merit in my opponents points.  First, I think Mr. Cox is absolutely right, U.S. gun policy has nothing to do with the issue.  There would be just as much of a drug war, just as much violence, if we banished U.S. guns;  the guns would come from somewhere else. I think Mr. Hutchinson has a fair point.  Countries are meant to be sovereign.  Mexico could, in principle, say We dont care what U.S. policy is.  We dont care about NAFTA.  We dont care how much the U.S. is harassing us.  We are going to legalize drugs, or We are going to de-escalate our own drug wars, because thats a sensible thing to do.  In principle, could they do that on their own?  Yes.  Would they come under enormous international pressure and U.S. pressure?  Absolutely.  So I think he is painting much, much too optimistic a case. I think that Jorge Castaneda has a very valid point.  Certainly, the situation got much worse when Caldern escalated, OK?  And the degree to which you try to enforce a drug war plays a huge role in how bad it is.  Many European countries have laws which are not so different than the U.S. laws, but they basically do almost nothing to try to enforce them.  They leave the cartels, they leave the suppliers basically alone, and they dont get nearly the magnitude of the violence and other negative side effects.  So there is certainly a valid point there as well. I would also note, I think, that four of the six of us here could agree that we would have liked the question to have been, Should the U.S. and Mexico de-escalate their war on drugs, OK?  And I think the three of us herealong with Jorgewould all agree within the affirmative for that.  So perhaps we can have another discussion on that point. But at the end of the day, the fact is that the U.S.throughout the last 90 yearshas done everything in its power to push its Puritanical, Prohibitionist message and policy on the rest of the world, Mexico being very much at the forefront, and going back well before Felipe Caldern.  So yes, America is to blame for the for the drug wars in Mexico.']\n",
      "['Global Public Square.', 'Thank you very much, its such a pleasure to be here.  You know, I feel very comfortable, I have to say, at the outset with the opposing team, sharing a podium with people with very different views about drugs, immigration, Mexico, because, my show at CNN is actually taped in the same studios as Lou Dobbss.   So I shared  [LAUGHTER]  I shared studio space with Lou Dobbs, I can share a platform with you gentlemen, Im delighted to do so.  Look, what I thought I would do is try to convince you as best I can, that you should vote for this proposition.   And, we are on the 40th anniversary of the drug war.  The war on drugs was declared by Richard Nixon, and it began a vast effort by the United States government, to transform the issue of drugs into one about criminality and war.   And it began a massive program in the United States that has spread throughout the region.  The results are in, 40 years out, I would argue.  We have spent about $1 trillion. That does not count by the way what local and state governments spend every year, to enforce the war on drugs, which is $41 billion.  Every year.  Now, if you look at any metric, I would argue, that would be reasonable to apply the availability of drug use, the potency of drugs, for the most part the pricethe metrics suggest the drug war has failed, it has done nothing to dampen demand, it has perhaps in many ways increased potency, and certainly increased criminality.   So, if you look at the simplest statistic in terms of what the effect of this vast war on drugs has had over the last 40 years.  In the 1970s, the United States had the same incarceration rate, as every other country in the world.  We were about at the world average in terms of how many people we imprisoned, as a percentage of our population.   That rate today, is five times the world average.  In 1980, those blissful, halcyon days of 1980, we had 41,000 people in prison on drug-related charges. Today we have 500,000 people.  So, if you ask yourself, what the effect in the United States has been it seems to me plain, it is blindingly obvious.   The question, I suppose, we have to then ask ourselves is what is the effect outside the United States, because there has been another effect of this war on drugs, which has been to internationalize the problem. Because we began this process, by interdicting in Miami, and then started moving to the sources, because the sources also started fleeing offshore.  Then we went into Central America. You all remember that before we had the heroic wars of liberation in Afghanistan and Iraq we had the heroic war of liberation in Panama, where Manuel Noriega was indicted in a US court for drug dealing and we decided to send the US Army there, play very loud rock music, I am not kidding, and effectively arrested him.  What has happened in almost all those cases is, the supply then shifts.   And so it then shifted to Colombia, and we began Plan Colombia, which has been a vast, multi-year effort with many, many hundreds of American soldiers.  When we talk about Mexicos drug war which I will get to, one has to remember, that the wars on drugs that the United States has initiated over the last 40 years, have very much been ones involving troops and soldiers and bullets and deaths.   Mexico is only the last in a long line of these drug wars.  And so we got to Colombia, where the United States has now spent something in the range of eight to $10 billion. Colombia for many years was the second or third largest recipient of US aid, and much of that aid has gone toward intensely military activities.   The GAO, the Government Accounting Office was asked to provide a summary report on what the effect of Plan Colombia has been.  And this was only a few months ago, asked for by Vice President Biden, then- Senator Biden, had commissioned the report.  And the results are plain.  It has had virtually no effect.  It seems as though heroin production is down, but cocaine production is up.  And so you see the familiar Whack-a-Mole problem of the drug trade, which is that you push something down and something else pops up.   And the two most common substitutions you see are the kind of drug, so you go from heroin to cocaine, and the place that these come from.  You push it out of the Caribbean, youit goes into Panama, you push it out of Panama it goes into Colombia, you push it out of Colombia, it goes to Mexico.   And thus Mexico has to be seen as the last of a long line of these battles, in Americas war on drugs.  And so in that sense you have to ask yourself, are we not in some way responsible for it?  Well heres the simple reality.  We are the largest consumer of drugs in the world.   We have the most demand in the world.  And we also have the largest supply of weaponry in the world.  2,000 guns cross the American border every day to go into Mexico.  Hillary Clinton has pointed out that we are arming the Mexican gangsters who operate the drug trade.   President Obama has pointed out that 90 percent of the weapons that are found in Mexico can be traced back to the United States.  There has been some contestation over the statistics Fox News says its only 17 percent, Factcheck.org says its probably higher than 36 percent, but maybe not quite as high as 90 percent.  Let me give you a simple statistic.  The United States has 280 million guns.  50 percent of all gun production every year is bought in the United States.  There are 80 million registered gun users in the United States.  There are 2,500 in Mexico.  I think we may have something to do with this problem.   So if you accept my proposition that the supply of weapons is coming from one place and the demand for drugs is coming from one place, it seems self-evident that we are responsible.  You will hear many convincing arguments by honorable people on that side.   Honorable opponents of the Mexican government like Mr. Castaneda who ran against President Caldern.  Asa Hutchinson who ran the Drug Enforcement Agency.  But remember one thing.  The only question we are asking you is are we in some way responsible. Let us not one more time shirk our responsibility, and accept that the United States, as the leading consumer of drugs, and the leading supplier of weapons, has got to be partly or substantially to blame for this.  Mexico is the latest battle', 'in Americas drug war', 'Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Im a little confused listening to that whole team because, Asa Hutchinson says, consumption is down.  Jorge Castaneda says consumption is up.  I mean Ive welcomed diversity but this is ridiculous.  [LAUGHTER]   And more fundamentally it seems as though there is a contradiction here which isAsa Hutchinson says, the problem, the reason Mexico has become this hellhole is because it did not declare war on drugs and did not prosecute efficiently and did not take the fight to the enemy.   So then they do that, and Jorge Castaneda says, thats the problem.  I think it just proves that this is all kabuki.  What we are talking about fundamentally is, these countries, among the poorer countries in the world, they are trying to fulfill insatiable demand for $65 billion of product.   If it goes away from Mexico we will be back here next year, and we will be talking about, you know, the drug war in Peru, or somewhere else, because, the supplyAsa Hutchinson, as a Republican you surely believe, that, if there is a huge amount of demand from the richest country in the world, somebody is going to figure out a way to supply it.', 'That somebody is Mexico right now and were blaming them.', 'Well, should I answer Asas  [LAUGHTER]  Because hes charging me with', 'I mean, you', 'you might be surprised but Asa, I would join with the former presidents of Brazil and Mexico and Colombia, who recently put out a report in which they said, we just need a paradigm shift here because what we have done is criminalize and terrorize this entire process, by waging war on drugs, and what we need to start doing, is a comprehensive review of whether there are ways to decriminalize it.   Look, many people have decriminalized drugs, I would be in favor of a controlled, slow, incremental approach, to see what happens.  But I think theres no question, that our current approach, massive criminalization, massive prohibitions, and most importantly the exporting of that war to other countries, is producing all the violence, its producing the criminality as Jeff pointed out. The reason this whole business is violent and criminal is because we have prosecuted it as a war.  That is to me the fundamental responsibility we have, which we cannot shirk from.  There are people dying in Mexico because of those choices that we have made.', 'Oh, theyre dropping like flies on that side [LAUGHTER]', 'No, my point was the one you raised, the general prevalence of 280 million guns here, which is about a third of all guns worldwide, the fact that we share a border with one of the poorer countries in the world, and there is vast drug trade and vast cartels meansthis is an easy way to criminalize and to accelerate the violence of this trade.', 'Can I just point out that we are respecting Mexicos sovereignty, we are not respecting so much Afghanistans sovereignty, we have a hundred thousand troops in there, NATO and the US, we will have 130,000 troops in there.  And yet, we have not been able to do anything about the opium trade.  I doubt very much if we send American troops into Mexico it would change the fundamental fact, where there is demand there will be supply', 'You have a controlled experiment.  It is very rare in history to have a very simple, controlled experimentwhich was the prohibition of alcohol.  And all these arguments were madeand thats alcohol consumption did decline somewhat during Prohibition, but it produced a vast criminal enterprise.  It produced associated crimes in exactly the way you are describing.  And then, once it was decriminalized, most of itthe vast majority of itwent away.  So you know, nothing  No analogy is perfect, but its very rare in history that you have actually, a case thats about as close as you can get Its very important also to point out, I think, for people thinking about this.  There are many different ways you can decriminalize. You can decriminalize with, you know, medical use.  You can decriminalize with a very strong public health campaign, the way we have done with tobacco.  It can be even stronger in terms of the regulatory issues involved.  So it  That you can decriminalize some and not others.  I do not agree that it is impossible to draw some lines.  Well, we draw lines all the time. Alcohol is, at some level, a drug, and we have decriminalized it. So it is possible to do this in many different ways.  We do have one historical example thats pretty powerful.', 'Thank you all very much.  And I want to tell you an anecdote.  I was in Singapore about 15 years ago and the leader of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yewa tough guy who runs a pretty tough shopwas coming under some pressure because he had very strict drug testing programs in Singapore.  And he explained the problem to me this way.  He said, You see, you Americans look at things very differently than we do.  When you have a drug problem, you look around and say, Well, where are the drugs coming from? Panama.  Lets go in and invade Panama, arrest the president, put him in jail, and thats how well solve the drug problem.   He said, I dont have that option in Singapore.  I have got to actually deal with the problem I have in my society.  And for that reason, I am going to have intrusive drug testing. I raise this to make two points.  One, you dont have to believe in decriminalization to believe that we are exporting this problem and have been exporting the war and the criminalization from the Caribbean through Colombia, and now into Mexico.  But the more important point I want to makeand I urge you  You know, its often you could look at these things as games.  It is very important that America own up to its responsibilities.  That we not push the blame on one more poor country, on one more neighbor.  That we recognize that we do have something to do with what is going on.  This is a disease in American foreign policy, it is a disease in American society.  And it is very important that you and the vote you makeand we as a society own up to it. There is this wonderful quote from Fitzgeralds Gatsby that I always remember about Tom and Daisy Buchanan.  He says of themas typical Americanshe says, They were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness.

      "['Well, I hope I get invited to the next official state dinner then [LAUGHTER]  You know, as an economist, over my career Ive been focused on what are the living standards of the American people, the working class.  How theyve done, and so what has mattered to me most on economic policy, is in fact, what have we done to create jobs, to get the unemployment rate down.   And so Im going to focus on the Recovery Act.  And Im here to say that I think it has actually been a bold and effective act.  No, it has not solved all our economic problems.  It has not solved the unemployment problem.  That is not quite the standard that you should imagine, for judging whether the policies are effective. Let me just saymy imagery for all this.  President Obama inherited a really large apartment building, it was all aflame, afire.  He gathered all the fire trucks and hoses he could, and he put out the flames, in at least half the floors.   But the critics say, look, theres still fire and so your policies must be wrong.  And especially, it turns out, these critics are the conservatives who actually lit the darn fire.  [LAUGHTER]  And they tried to keep the fire hoses from actually getting to the fire building.  [LAUGHTER] I think its actually quite outrageous.  Now its a somewhat different  [APPLAUSE]  I think its somewhat different to my longtime, I dont have any old friends, only have longtime friends, Jamie Galbraith.  But well get around to that.  So let me talk at first about what the fire was.  Mark talked about it.  Over the nine months that included the last half of 2008 and the first three months of 2009, none of which were the responsibility of President Obama, okay, we had the fastest decline in the on a quarterly basis.   We had already seen six million jobs lost by March 2009.  The unemployment rate was already 8.5 percent, which is the highest it was since the great, really deep recession of the early 1980s.  So we were in deepyou know what.  [LAUGHTER]   And so we had the Recovery Act which was passed very quickly and effectively, actually started having some effect in March, but mostly started having an effect in April.  And I want to go through exactly what it does, so its not an abstraction.  What are the different components.   First as Mark mentioned, support to the unemployed, and helping them not only with unemployment benefits and higher benefits, extended benefits, and health care, and a major increase in food stamps. Why does that matter.  By supporting their incomes and their spending it creates jobs, throughout the economy.  Secondly. There was a major influx of money to state governments, who, by resolving their own deficits when they have to cut programs and raise taxes, they actually--what Paul Krugman said is they are like 50 little Herbert Hoovers.   They are driving us into recession, by actually exacerbating the problem.  Okay.  When you give them the money, they dont cut the programs, they keep the people that work for them in the local governments employ.   To keep the contractors and the private sector delivering construction contracts, health care, nursing homes, et cetera, employed, and by all those people being employed through spending money they keep jobs going throughout the economy. Okay, theres also a third, a tax cut that was in effect in April, everybodys withholding on their W-2s, was actually increased, providing more income, more money to spend.  Last there was some government spending in infrastructure that started going out.   But the main infrastructure spending, actually is scheduled for 2010.  Thats when we get the energy alternatives, thats when we get more infrastructure, and other things that are going to create productivity in the long run as well as create jobs.  What has been the effect of all this spending?  Well as Mark said, over the last six months, weve actually seen a much different outcome than what was projected in the springtime, the economy shrank by a little bit, it wouldve shrunk by around 4 percent, but it actually shrank by a little bit less than 1 percent.   In the summer the economy actually grew.  Now, as someone dedicated to raising the living standards of the entire broad middle class, whos satisfied with that, Im not satisfied with that, okay?   But the question is, are you going to judge the Obama administration policy ineffective, because it hasnt corrected what I think is 30 years of generating inequality, false-hearted, silly deregulation and worshipping of markets where we shouldnt have done it that got us into this darn mess?   I dont think thats quite appropriate.  [APPLAUSE]  Thank youdont take my time.  Um [LAUGHTER]  We calculate that the Recovery Act has actually created anywhere between 1.1 to 1.5 million jobs by the end of September.  Im not satisfied that the job losses are 200,000 rather than 700,000, but I think its quite great.   Im very worried about the fact that unemployment is going to be high for many years to come, too high.  I dont blame that on President Obama, I blame that on the bums that put us in this mess.  And you should too.  [APPLAUSE]   Now, its true that the unemployment rate is higher than what the administration said it was going to be.  They said if we did the Recovery Act it was going to only get to 8 percent.  Well, let me mention something.   The unemployment rate in March, before the Recovery Act even had an effect was already 8.5 percent.  Now I did tell my friends in the White House, thats a silly thing, dont project like that.  You shouldnt do that, youre going to get caught by that, and in fact, they have been hung by their own petard so to speak.   But the fact is that, let me tell you that this is not a policy failure.  This is a failure of my profession, economists.  If you look at what economists projected right at the time of the election, the blue- chip forecasts, and look at that same period I told you about, the nine months that includes the last half of last year and the first three months of this year.  Now theyre already halfway through that period.  And they were saying that the economy was going to shrink at a 1.5 percent rate, over that nine-month period.  And it actually shrank by three times that much.  So the fact is, what the administration got wrong in its forecast was it didnt have a right sense of what things were going to be without the policy.   I think they got the policy right, the policys had a substantial impact.  Now has it solved all our problems, the fact is Im not so sure how much more couldve been done, economically.  I can darn well tell you that politically, there was not much more on the table that they could get.   What was put through the House and was put through the Senate, what was stopped, is some people that were in the Senate, who are known as moderates which just means they want to do a little bit less of what everybody else', 'And thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, I really think its worth keeping two things separate.  One is the whole financial market issue, which is primarily the motivation of what youre talking about, Eliot.  Youre talking about spending.   And then theres the question of jobs and the Recovery Act.  And it seems to me that there was nothing foreordained that anyone who got elected was going to actually do what was done and put together a nearly eight hundred billion dollar package to go through CongressThey wouldnt have been able to get it through Congressand that was going to be able to move the needle as much as the needle has been moved.   Not that were to be satisfied.  I mean, you know, this is the-- my friends that are fellow liberalsJamie and Eliotare basically arguing against the excellent is the enemy of the very, very good. And that is, in my mind, just not really and especially to have a former elected official do that, just seems otherworldly to me, to tell you the truth.  [SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE]  You know, Im a close observer of Washington.  I watched what the so-called moderates did in the Senate to that stimulus bill.  They took out, a substantial amount of aid to the states.  They took out a school modernization program that last summer could have actually rebuilt a lot of schools, created a lot of jobs.  And they stuck in there something that was going to be done anyway, which is the ANT relief, which is basically tax relief for wealthy income tax payers.  That in effect, is proof positive that they got as much as they could out of the political system.  If you wanted to get more you had to have a different Congress.  I dont think there was a different political strategy.  I can [UNCLEAR]', '[OVERLAP]  Im yielding, I yield to Steve.  [UNCLEAR] [OVERLAPPING VOICES]  My buddy Steve.', 'Right, can I weigh in on this?', 'I absolutely think that the massive inequalities in our nation, were the precondition for the crisis that were in right now.  And I believe that the Obama administrations plans actually do address many of the issues, not all the issues going forward, to try to resolve that.   Part of it is to develop a productive economy based on a non-carbon-based economy, part of it is to address changes in our basic labor markets, to have enforced labor laws and the basic wage and hours type things, to be able to restore the right to have unions, to raise the minimum wage.  We are, they are also pursuing having universal health care, which is a mechanism for distributing income throughout the population, and security, and to try to do they can to try to get unemployment down as fast as they can which I think is in fact what the policy is.  So I think that moving forward, building an economy where were not having growth based on asset bubbles and consumer debt, is really important, and that the only way to do that is to have wages growing in line with productivity, and to have more economic security, and I think that if Mr. McCain had been elected we would be nowhere on that agenda.  With Mr. Obama, I think were around 75 percent on the right track towards that agenda', 'Well, I think that these kinds of policies are exactly whats needed to build the economy we need to come out of this recovery.  We need an economy which provides broadly shared prosperity, this is something that we havent had in 30 years. Prior to 2007 the prior 20 years or so, some 56 percent of all the income gains went to the upper 1 percent.  That is not acceptable.  It is also the predicate to the kind of crisis that weve had, because we can only have a robustly growing economy thats sustainable if people are able to earn good wages and be able to spend based on those wages without going into debt or relying on asset bubbles.  So I do think small business ideology says that these are not going to be good for them, but in fact it will be good for them, because its going to create a robust consumer economy thats going to create a lot of different jobs, and thats going to start benefiting everybody for once and for all.', 'If the future is grimand I agree with Allan Meltzer that in fact there is going to be persistently high unemployment, thats unacceptable.  Is that the Obamas administration fault?  Is that the fault of the kind of policies that actually Allan himself and conservative allies have advocated for many different years. [APPLAUSE]   To my liberal friends  What Ive said that there was an apartment building on fire, and Eliot says, well maybe there were some fire trucks in the next county that couldve actually helped put out the fire, in fact, I can tell you that he hasnt named any other county which had the fire trucks, and what they would do, or said how they would get around the roadblock of the Republican moderates in the Senate that actually blocked an even more effective stimulus that was actually on the table.   In my view, theres been, and I have not been an Obama supporter from day one of that campaign, Im far from in the bag for the Obama administration, Im to the left of the Obama administration, okay?  [APPLAUSE]   Ive been surprisingly pleased, much more pleased than I ever thought I would be by the direction of what they did with the recovery plan, much larger, well-designed in terms of putting out some money early that got things going.   Some back-end public investments for energy alternatives, infrastructure, science, training, education, et cetera, I think very well-designed and smart.  A lot of their other policies are directly on target, theyre trying to do big, bold things.  Im quite surprised and quite pleased, you should be as well. [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Well, my paternal grandparents, who were fur peddlers in Moscow, would be rather shocked at the idea that I was a Czar of any kind, so I will...I dont have anything to follow Allan Meltzers last remark, Im afraid... [LAUGHTER]  But I was struck listening to the first two speakers from the other side.  I feel a little bit like Goldilocks.  I heard one speaker that we in the Obama Administration were too hot and I heard one sort of imply we were too cold.  And that makes me think we got it about right. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]   All kidding aside, I actually do want to make a serious point.  And with all due respect to the first two speakers from the other side, I want to try to take the ethereal world of theory and connect it to the real world of politics. Because I heard a few things that kind of, that did strike me.  I heard Jamie say, Congress must provide more resources.  We must resolve the toxic banks.  We cant let it be decided by Congress.  Well, who else decides things besides Congress?  We have to stop the displacement of people from their homes.  I mean, these are all wonderful phrases but this is, as I found in my six months in Washington, not how the world works.  As Rahm Emanuel said the other day, Its fine to imagine yourself sitting under a shady tree at the Aspen Institute thinking of great policies. But then eventually you have to come to grips with the real world and deal with it.  So you can say, people can say our stimulus program was not enough, but the fact is, as Larry said just at the end of his remarks, it was all Congress was going to pass.  There was no more there.  It took every ounce of political muscle that the administration had to get that.  You can say it was too much but I think as Larry Summers has said many times, when you are facing a potential disaster you err on the side of doing more, not less.  And they did as much as was possible.  So I just want to try to again connect back to this sort of real world of politics and of getting things done that was really one of the biggest surprises that I found coming to Washington. We may all talk about the President and say, Its the Presidents decision.  The President recommends this, the President does that.  But there is a little thing called Congress that has to be dealt with as well and that becomes a series of gives and takes and judgments.  And so when Jamie Galbraith says, All Obama did was two things:  the stimulus program and the low interest rateswhich actually wasnt even Obama.  That was the Federal Reserveits really not fair.  I think the Obama Administration  and well talk more about autos in a minutebut this Financial Regulatory Reform which has been put forward, this energy which has been put forward, this health care which has been put forward, this housing which has been put forwardall these problems that were unattended to for the last eight years, this administration is trying its hardest to address in a thoughtful, responsible way.  [APPLAUSE] Let me turn for a minute now to the auto sector as well because I think my two fellow panelists made very, very coherent and logical and I hope ultimately persuasive cases for why the rest of the policy actions that the administration took were thoughtful. And so let me talk for a second about autos.  Because it was an interesting area.  Its one of the few areas where the President actually did have authority.  And so if you dont like what the President did on autos, its fair to blame the administration for that because we didnt have to go to Congress.  We had TARP money.  We didnt have to deal with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, except in one fairly minor way.  We were pretty free to act. And when we showed up we had a bunch of people from one side of the aisle saying, Youve gotta let these companies fail. Youve gotta let the market work.  Im sorry I dont have any quotes from Jamie, but I did see one quote from Allan when I was poking around where, when Lehman Brothers went out of business Allan said, No big deal.  Its fine.  Thats the way--you should have consequences from capitalism.  Thats the way it should work.  And then a year later he said Lehman Brothers should have been saved.  And so we had a lot of people saying to us, Oh, just let the market work.  Well, I hope the people who said, Lets just let the market work, knew what that would have meant.  It would have meant that Chrysler and GM would have shut down by the end of March.  It would have meant that hundreds of suppliers would have gone out of business.  They all would have liquidated.  It would have meant that Ford would have stopped making cars because they wouldnt have been able to get parts because their suppliers, many of them, would have been shut down.  And you would have had something like three million people out of work, mostly in the industrial Midwest right at the end of March, right when the economy was at its worst. So its fine to say, Lets let the market work.  But again, lets try to connect it back to the real world and what the real world consequences would be of letting that happen.  Then you had some people, frankly, on the other side who basically said, You cant let these companies go bankrupt.  It would be catastrophic, it would be a disaster.  Nobody would buy cars.  They would eventually liquidate.  You cant possibly do that.  But President Obama made the decision that we werent going to simply kick the can down the road, frankly, the way the previous administration had, and we were only going to inject money in the context of a fundamental restructuring that might have to include bankruptcy, which it ultimately did.  And we achieved unprecedented sacrifices from all the stakeholdersfrom the lenders, from the UAW, from the suppliers, from the dealers, from everybody who was affectedcame to the table and, frankly, with a fair amount of muscle from the administration, participated in this restructuring. And the result of that was that today General Motors announced their earnings.  Theyre still losing money but their performance was wildly better than anybody would have guessed.  They have forty-two billion dollars of cash in the bank at the moment and they are performing well ahead of the expectations that we had. Theyre out of bankruptcy.  Chrysler is out of bankruptcy in alliance with Fiat.  So I think it is a very vivid example of a place where we werent too hot, we werent too cold.  We were very pragmatic.  We addressed the problem, we focused on it and we tried to come up with the best solution for all concerned. And I think that that exercise, which I was proud to be a small part of, was emblematic of the approach that this administration has taken.  Tim Geithner and Larry Summers, the two principal economic policy makers, have strong views of principle but they are experienced, they are pragmatic.  They know how to get things done.  They are balanced and they are very thoughtful. And I think that the approach that they have taken throughout this process has been enormously positive and has led to all the things that you heard Larry and Mark talk about in terms of bringing this country back from the abyss, bringing us back from a depression and getting us started down the road.  Of course, I think it wasI forget who on the other side said47 percent of people think the economy is the most important issue.  Of course its the most important issue.  But that doesnt mean we havent made good progress.  That doesnt mean that disaster hasnt been averted and those green shoots that people talk about have begun to sprout.  So I was very proud to be a part of that and I would simply say to you, Would you prefer this administration or the last administration or some other administration?  Because I think this administration has done awfully well.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, I dont think any of us would disagree with that.  I think, without getting into a big semantic debate over the question, if the question were:  Is the economy in a happy place?, wed all be on one side of the table.   The question in effect, in my mind, is, Has Obama put forward and tried to implement policies that will have a positive effect on the economy and move it in the right direction?  And I think, I hope weve all made a very clear, convincing case that it has, and will.  Nobody would disagree, you guys are great at giving us a litany of whats wrong.  Eliot, you gave us six minutes and forty-five seconds of whats wrong with the economy and I only heard one or two suggestions what to actually do about it.  I dont know what your suggestion is about General Motors.  Is it to let it to go bankrupt and have a couple of million people out of jobs?  I dont know what your suggestion is about Goldman Sachs and the derivatives contracts.  I dont like it any better than you do.  Would you like the financial system to melt down the way Lehman Brothers did?  I dont know what your suggestion is about how to fix regulatory reform, which the administration has put forward a proposal which is mired in all the Congressional politics around it.  And I guess, Im surprised because you were Governor.  You know what its like up there. You were the, you showed up in Albany and said, Day one everything changes.  And it didnt because you had the legislature.  [APPLAUSE]', '[OVERLAP]  Thats', 'My buddy Larry.  [LAUGHTER]  Weve never agreed on anything before.  No, Im kidding', 'Look, I want to wrap this back to this whole idea about cars and everything.  The green economy is an important part of the futurebut I think Jamie and I might even agree on thisbut it is the longer term future.  And the Obama Administration, I would argue, has all kinds of proposals that it is pushing vigorously to implement a green economy.  But we are kidding ourselves if we think the green economy is the solution to our immediate economic problems.  We are kidding ourselves if we think we could have let General Motors go bankrupt and built five hundred whatever it was that you said you wanted to build, [LAUGHTER]  in its place.  And that would employ the million people who would have lost their jobs if General Motors had gotten James Galbraith [OVERLAP]  Weve moved past that point to try and make a broader point in', 'Not quite.', '[LAUGHTER]  The Department of Energy, which was passed under the previous administration, actually, has a $25 billion loan program for advanced electrification of their-- new technology type of vehicles as a loan program.  I will be curious to know if thats the kind of program that Allan Meltzer would endorse as part of his belief in investment or whether he thinks thats another government sort of give away boondoggle thing.', 'Ill make a couple of very quick points.  And I dont want to be an apologist for the financial services industry, even though I spent twenty-six reasonably happy years in it.  But let, but I was not at a TARP bank.  I was not at Goldman Sachs.   Let me just say a couple of quick things.  First, to say that nobody in the financial system has suffered any pain, you should ask the people who worked at Lehman Brothers.  You should ask the people who work at Citigroup, you should ask the people who worked at Wachovia, they  [APPLAUSE]  Most of them had huge amounts of their net worth in those firms.  Ask people who didnt get bonuses last year, Goldman Sachs is Goldman Sachs but a lot of people in the financial services industry took a lot of pain.  The', 'Well, no, no, no, no.  No, that is not true, because as Mark just said, I think when the dust settles, I think you will find that the government actually did pretty well on a lot of these investments. Maybe not AIG, we can debate AIG.  But the money they put into Goldman Sachs and into Morgan Stanley, first of all was involuntary, those banks didnt even want the money, the government forced them to take the money because they didnt want the weak banks to stand out, and a lot of them as Mark said have already repaid it.   And let me just make one last point about too bigactually two last points, one about too big to fail. Too big to fail, you know, its not about repealing Glass-Steagall, its not about saying you cant have more than this amount of assets.   Many of you will remember LTCM, which went under in 1998 if I remember correctly, most people never heard of LTCM, it was probably not in the top 50 size of institutions and it almost brought down the entire financial system.  Im all for fixing these problems but lets do it thoughtfully, not with a meat axe.', 'No, thats notthats not true', 'Thats not [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'Absolutely not true  [OVERLAPPING VOICES, [LAUGHTER] The Fed had no', 'The Fed', 'The Fedthe Fed', 'The Fed had no', 'The Fed had no [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'Why me  [LAUGHS]', 'Yeah, it was almost a miracle', 'I think this is in all seriousness a huge issue for the country to think about, and, you know, theres this great quote of Jeffersons where he says if I had to choose between a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I would choose newspapers without a government.   And I say that not because Im advocating newspapers but, the whole concept when you get to Washington of realizing what Jefferson had in mind when he designed or was part of designing our system, the Capitols on the hill, the White House is down at the bottom.   Article I of the Constitution is the Congress, its not the executive branch.  The power that the Congress has is formidable and it was created in an era where we werent going to be dealing with toxic assets and we werent going to be dealing with regulatory reform,  and we werent going to be dealing with green jobs, and its a real problem, I think as Ive tried to argue that I think President Obama has done as effective a job as humanly possible in promoting a responsible agenda through Congress.   But if you take something like reg reformfinancial regulatory reform, not to use the jargon, it is mired in a series of intra-Congressional jurisdictional disputes over who would be in charge of this agency or that agency if you happen to pass something.  It is a very broken system.', 'So Eliot, let me see if I have this right, the mistake we made was quenching the fires of financial crisis which took away the urgency to do anything about it so we should restore the financial crisis so there is some desire to do something about it, is that right?  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]', 'My  Wait a minute, wait a minute, I', 'This is my chance to', 'to have a last word without you saying anything.   So I want to say that the only systemic authority that the federal reserve wouldve had to bail out Lehman Brothers, wouldve been to bail out Lehman Brothers exactly what you dont want to have happen, so there was no authority to deal with Lehman Brothers. One more comment to you before I leave you alone for a second, [LAUGHTER]  this idea that we haveand to Jamie as wellthe idea we have a majority in Congress, yes, we have a majority in Congress, it is very much in name only.  We created, our political leaders, a big tent in order to have those majorities.  That tent spans a lot of ideologies and it is very difficult to marshal majorities let alone the 60 votes you need in the Senate where there are two independents, to get something done, and you guys make it sound easy, it is not, it is not easy, you make everything sound easy, you tell us  [LAUGHTER]   You know, just wave your magic wand and youll have financial regulatory reform, its not that easy.  Youve also set up a false dichotomy, youve said that, youve raised this question of whether or not we should have more action, of course we should have more action, we all agree that we should have more action.  The question is, what is responsible, how do you get it done, and what makes good sense. And I would argue what I said before, I wont repeat it all, that this administrations put forward responsible policies in every area.   Is financial regulatory reform is it what I would do or what Eliot would do, left to our own designs, no.  But is it something that they spent a lot of time vetting with Congress people to try to come up with something that had a change of passage so that we would actually get something done as opposed to getting nothing done, its back to Larrys dont let the perfect be the enemy of the good.   They did, and they have something out there, they have walked the walk, theyve talked the talk.  And what I frankly have heard tonight from the other panel, is, lets just go do it and lets pretend were at the Aspen Institute or the Brookings Institution, its just not how it works. [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Im an ecumenical economist, lets put it that way.  I want to thank Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to be here today, its certainly an honor to be here and to address such an important topic.  Im going to make three points in my opening remarks.  Point number one.  I think its really quite amazing the totality of the policy response from the administration, I think, we forget all the things that have been done to try to shore up the economy and we tend to focus on the one or two or three things that were most annoyed about, and we focus on that.  Let me just spend a few minutes, well, Ive got six minutes and 30 seconds, let me spend a couple minutes going over that.  And there are three broad areas of policy effort here, first is the effort to shore up to the financial system, and this is everything from what the FDIC has done, increasing deposit insurance limits, to guaranteeing bank debt to allow the banks to issue [UNCLEAR], to efforts by the Treasury to help facilitate all the things that the Federal Reserve Board has been doing to try to provide credit to the financial system and stabilize the financial system.   Perhaps the most important thing in my mind with regard to the effort to shore up the financial system, was the banks stress tests--do you remember the stress test, this was done back earlier this year.  And to me, those stress tests were the modern-day equivalent of what FDR did back in the Great Depression, he Im going to exaggerate just a little bit but only a little bit.  He closed all the banks on a Friday and he said on the subsequent Monday to his Treasury Secretary, open all of them except a couple hundred of them and the Treasury Secretary said to him, well, which ones should I open, and FDR said, well, it really doesnt matter because the ones you open, everything will think are safe, and life will go on and  [LAUGHTER]   In fact it worked, it restored confidence and that was the beginning of the end of the Great Depression and the stress test in fact did that, it restored confidence and the financial system is stable.  The second blotter of the policy response was to shore up the two weakest parts of our economy, the housing market and the auto market.   Im not going to spend much time on the auto market because Steve is so intimately involved in that great effort, and hell talk about that, but I know housing, and the efforts to shore up the housing market have been quite amazing, and just to name a few things.   The first-time homebuyer tax credit, very important in stabilizing housing values this summer, to help to support buying by first-time home buyers, the loan modification plan to help homeowners who are facing foreclosure, to get their monthly mortgage payments down so that they can afford their, their mortgage payment.  Efforts to provide more credit to the residential mortgage market through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and FHA.   Heres a statistic for you.  90 percent of all the residential mortgage loans being made today are being made by the federal government,  so if the federal government wasnt making those loans, the housing market would be in complete disarray and wed be in very significant trouble, so the second broad policy effort was to help shore up those two key sectors, the two weakest sectors of our economy.  And the third policy response, broadly speaking, is the fiscal stimulus, much maligned, but ultimately at the end of the day, very successful.  I dont think its any accident that the recession came to an end, at the same time that the stimulus was providing its maximum economic benefit to the economy.   And the stimulus is lots of things, its aid to unemployed workers, its helped the state governments, its the first-time homebuyer tax credit, its Cash for Clunkers, a long list of things, the infrastructure spending, all very important.  So, please remember, point number one, that the policy effort is a range of many things, its been incredibly its amassing and incredibly unprecedented what has been done here, and key to bringing an end to this Great Recession.  Point number two, here are the statistics I think are overwhelming.   A year ago, think about a year ago, what was going on, major financial institutions were evaporating or being nationalized, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman, Bear, AIG, Citigroup was on the doorstep of falling apart, and look at the situation today. The financial system is not normal, no, but it is stable.  And banks arent lending to us yet as business people and as consumers but theyre moving in that direction, and just imagine where wed be today without that stability in the financial system. Think about the economic statistics, housing activity, new and existing single-family housing starts hit a low in January, housing construction hit a low in January, back at the beginning of the year, housing values were falling very rapidly, today, the last couple of quarters theyve actually begun to increase.   GDP, the value of all the things that we produce as an economy, grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter and the growth was very broad- based, that was the first substantive growth in over a year and a half.   And clearly driving the economy forward, the GDP in the fourth quarter, the current quarter, is on track to be positive again.  The job market.  Last thing to improve, but it is improving, were moving in the right direction.  Wejust to give you a statistic, at the beginning of the year, we were losing 700,000 jobs on average every single month.   In the last three months we lost 200,000 jobs a month, now I know, thats a lot of jobs, unemployment is still rising.  But the trend lines are right, theyre moving in the right direction and my view is by early next year, we will have a stable job market, and by the end of next year, we will have job growth thats meaningful enough to bring down the rate of unemployment, so everything is moving in the right direction.  Finally, point number three, I said there were three points  The proposition is, Obamas Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.  Its not, they have worked.  This is not a mission accomplished, no one is arguing that this is over and done with, we have more work to do, and the administration is still working.  Just last week, they passed another piece of legislation to help extend unemployment insurance benefits for people who lose their jobs in 2009, now if you become unemployed in 2009 you have 99 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits, they extended, and they expanded the first- time homebuyer tax credit into next year to provide support to the housing market, and theyve provided a number of other supports.  They are debating right now and will likely pass other efforts to shore up the economy, extend some of the other provisions in the stimulus to make sure that the stimulus provides benefit to the economy as we make our way into 2010. And more importantly and perhaps most importantly, we are working through some of the structural problems in our economy,  working on the hard, difficult issues, the most obvious would be financial regulatory reform.  Now this is something you dont want to do quickly, you dont want to make a mistake.  Our financial regulatory structure has been in place since the Great Depression.   It feels like it, and we have got to take time to make it right.  So, in my view, what the administration has done has been highly successful.', '[INAUDIBLE]', 'Ill take a crack at it.  No.  [LAUGHS]  In a word.  Do you remember back a year ago?  Do you remember?  Thats free fall. Thats when we were panicked, when there were runs on major banking institutions Wachovia, Washington Mutual.  You were afraid to keep your money in your bank.  The stock market was in complete free fall.  Housing values were falling 5, 10, 15 percent.  We were losing 700,000 jobs per month.  Thats free fall. Today, weve got stability.  The policies arent magic.  They cant work overnight in a matter of a few months.  But look where we are today.  Think about the counter-factual.  Think about what the world would look like without these policy responses.  In my strong opinion, we averted what would have been another depression.  Yes, this was a very severe recession, but we averted a depression.  So, no, were not in free fall.  Were [UNCLEAR]', '[OVERLAP]  Thats fourth, Eliot, fourth.  [LAUGHTER]', '[OVERLAP]  Dont fudge, now, dont fudge.', 'Well, just a fact, one fact and then two responses.  Just another statistic.  Household net worth, thats the value of all the things that we owe less all the things that we owe.  This is our net worth.  It declined by $15 trillion between the peak in 07 Q3 through the bottom in 08 Q4.  $15 trillion.  And just to give you a context, theres about $60 trillion worth, at the peak there was about $60 trillion in household net worth.  Since the beginning of the year or since the administrations inauguration, household net worth has risen by $5 trillion, $5 trillion.  So that obviously reflects the improvement in the equity markets, stock pricesat least as measured by the S&P 500are up.  I didnt look today but its up somewhere between 25 and 30 percent since he was brought into office.  And housing values have started to rise. They fell sharply through the beginning of the year down 30 percent from the peak and now theyve begun to rise.  So to me thats a very important statistic because thats our net worth. Now, two quick responses, one with respect to the deficit.  I think this is a legitimate concern.  Obviously, it is a critical concern that we had a $1.4 trillion deficit, at 10 percent of GDP in fiscal year 09.  And were going to run up a $1.2 trillion deficit at least in the current fiscal year.  These are big numbers.  But, you know, this was a Hobsons choice for us.  It really was no choice. If the policy makers did not respond aggressively to this and use the resources the economy would still be in recession, the financial system would be in disarray and the cost to taxpayers measurably greater, measurably greater.  The deficits would be larger than they are.  So we really had no choice in this.  And I think, as well, the deficits are something that are the result of it. Now, finally, one other response. You know, in the efforts to shore up the financial system in the auto sector and other parts of the economy, we did get something.  We got equity in a lot of these companies.  And today GM said that they were going to begin repaying the loan that we made to them well before plan.  And in fact, heres a prediction. This is what I do for a living.  I predict that at the end of the day we are going to get most of that money back, if not all of it, and in fact, many of the banks had repaid a lot of the loans, capital we took into the institutions and weve made money on that.  So I think when this is all said and done and over and done with, the cost will be measurably greater.  And thats because we did get something when we did help them get through this period.', 'Well, the financial services industry wouldnt agree with that. Theyre fighting financial regulatory reform very strongly.  They feel that these efforts arent in their best interest.  So I dont think they would agree with that position.  [LAUGHTER]  And actually it is, well, quite substantive, the reform that is making its way through Congress.  You know, there is a lot of debate but broadly speaking, a number of things are going to come out of this.  First, the number of regulators that oversee the financial system will be rationalized.  One of the problems we had in the previous regulatory structure was that there was just too many regulators and financial institutions could shop for the regulator or avoid regulation altogether. And so there is an effort to address that.  There is also an effort to fashion a systemic risk regulator that can look across the entire financial scene.  Another problem we had in this current financial crisis is that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury did not have the ability to quickly resolve cases like Lehman Brothers, which were not bank holding companies at the time. And then, third, also very important, the effort to establish a consumer financial protection agency.  The idea is establishing an FDA for financial products because I think its clear from the crisis that many people who got loans really did not understand the loans that they were getting and that caused greater problems.  So, and Im quickly summarizing for you.  But the scope of the reform', '...isYeah, sorryis very significant and the system will be very different at the other end of this.', 'Well, I think the decline in the dollar that weve observed recently over the last six to nine months is entirely appropriate, and actually its been very orderly.   Entirely appropriate and a net positive for our economy, at least so far, that, yes, it has resulted in somewhat higher commodity prices in the one commodity that matters the most--is the price of oil for all of us.   But that negative has been offset by an increase in exports.  A source of growth in our economy.  It was a very significant negative back in the free fall, a year ago, nine months ago, but is now growing again in part because of the better global economy, in part because of the weaker dollar.   Also its helped corporate profits, a lot of companies that operate overseas are benefiting from the dollar, so its a net positive, now, I do think if you look further out, and the dollar begins to decline in a disorderly way for whatever reason, that would be a problem, but so far, no problem, very good.', 'Yeah, you know, to me, I think people lose sight of the severity of the situation that weve been in, the crisis that weve just gone through.  The panic and the Great Recession, it truly, it is the longest deepest, broadest-based recession since the Great Depression, theres no--all the statistics are very clear on that. And I think the administration has been thrust into this, in the middle of it, and has been all about trying to bring an end to that crisis, to quell the crisis, to quell the panic, to bring an end to the Great Recession, and here we are, you know, nine months into this administration, and look.  The panic has been quelled.  Were still nervous, were still cautious.  We havent gotten our groove back.  [LAUGHS]  But, just think where we were, the Great Recession is over.   The Great Recession is over, yes, its not fully engaged.  Businesses went through near-death experiences, theyre not going to forget that and step out and start hiring immediately, you know.  Policy isnt magic.  Its not magic.   But the recession is over and were moving in the right direction. Now.  Its fair to say that we need to do more.  Absolutely.  You know, but the proposition is, are the Obama administrations economic policies working effectively, working.   No ones saying theyve worked, that were done, that this is a work in progress, that the script hasnt been written, and the administration as got a range of policies that its put forward, tough policies on difficult issues, things that we hadnt been able to address, health care, financial regulatory reform, energy policy, tax reform, a budget deficit thats been a problem for many, many years, and look, were starting to discuss it and that to me is proof positive that, they are working and were working in the right direction.  Thank you.']\n",

      "['[OVERLAP]  Thank you.  And thank you, Katrina.  I would say that new media has a lot to learn from The Nation, which most these days resembles a blog, more than anything else in the mainstream media.  And I think we owe The Nation a debt.  But speaking directly to people is nothing new.  And the idea that our opponents would have us believe that somehow freedom of the press and the accountability of the media to hold institutions accountable and to keep them honest --  is somehow created by this for-profit structure that my colleague Michael describes compellingly is dead and that my colleague Jim describes is alive and well, at least in terms of its voice and its passion for accountability in the new media is at odds with what the Constitution is about. The first amendment enabled the mainstream media and what have they done with the custodianship of this authority and this sense of holding us all accountable in this democracy and in doing the quality reporting that we so value?  What have they done?  What are we defending here?  In September, The Beatles Rock Band Project was, a product,was unveiled.  And it was extraordinarily successful and it was a profound argument to those in the corporate for-profit media in the music business that said somehow the means of distribution being freed from the record companies to people who actually play and use music was going to destroy music in some sense:  that if the record business went away somehow music would be affected, that somehow the art form of music and the quality of music would be affected. What instead happened was people bought Beatles Rock Band because they wanted the music.  They also wanted the experience of being in the band.  They wanted to part of the music itself.  The technology enabled people suddenly to be a part of something that they were not permitted to be a part of. Why?  Because the for-profit structure of mainstream media prevented them.  Its an old story in America.  When the means of distribution goes out of the hands of the small set of individuals and individual institutions that control it, change is afoot.   This is a moment we should embrace.  All of the institutions described by our opponents were created in times of similar transformation.  The Hearst era, the New York Times, the tabloid era in American history which formed the basis of the American Revolution were all transformational moments when mainstream media was going away and new media was coming in. This is a moment to celebrate.  Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media --  it should be written in the Constitution. [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  What are they trying to preserve here? John Donvan says that I dabbled in the mainstream media.  No, no, no --  I was handcuffed to the wall of the mainstream media, ladies and gentlemen.  [LAUGHTER]  Are we preserving the office culture and mentality at a television network where the senior editor of a news program holds an office poll to bet on the ratings for next mornings program --  that culture?   The obsession with the ages of the audience, as many jokes have been made here tonight --  this is something for the mainstream media.  Chasing eyeballs, commodifying eyeballs --  thats the business.  At the height of the war in Iraq, that Katrina suggests President Bush led us into, the number one news broadcast reporting on that war was owned by a defense contractor. Is that what were preserving here?  Is there not a conflict of interest in that situation?  Do we want to perpetuate that?  Are we saying that the mainstream media, which has so humored these wonderful journalists who get paid not as much as the executives at the for-profit media, but we want to have them around because they hold the media accountable.  They hold the government accountable.  This is a disservice, number one, to the first amendment.  Its a disservice to journalism.  My first job as a journalist was a volunteer.  Now, Im not saying that I would give up all of my income at this stage in my life, but the best journalists are people who dont do it for the money.  We want to create institutions that are all about doing it for the money and then we expect that the values of journalism and reporting are going to be maintained in that structure? And then when it changes and institutions like my colleague Jim describes, Politico.com --  where that I will do journalism whether Im paid or not kind of passion comes into play --  were going to say, Oh, my gosh, whats happening?  Were throwing out the baby with the bath water.  Theres something wrong here.  Weve gotta stop this.  No, this is how it works.  We do not look to the mainstream media to preserve the first amendment. [SCATTERED APPLAUSE]  We look to the first amendment to preserve the voices of the people --  on Twitter who are holding the people accountable:  on Facebook, on social media, in blogs - -  who are creating media and publishing media on their own. When the means of distribution leaves the hands of the few the many benefit.  Now, are we to judge the success of this transformation by who is making money or not?  Is that consistent with the values of we want to hold the government accountable? We want journalism to be the Fifth Estate.  This is the mechanisms of democracy.  If our gauge for the health of the media is whether some folks are making money then weve given up at the beginning.  We basically conceded the debate and I wont concede the debate.  Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media.  They had custodianship of this sense of authority for quite a while.  And what did they bring us?  Two words:  balloon boy.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  Iraq.  [CHEERS]', 'Look, wait, wait a minute', 'here, heres the problem, heres the problem with that.  I mean, okay, theres a lot of moaning and handwringing about whats going away and itthat somehow new media is ending the old media, well no, were in a transformational moment, things are ending and other things are beginning.   Where you dont go, and this is surprising to me.  Are you arguing for an explicit protected subsidy of these media divisions, of these news divisions of these organizations where, somehow in the federal tax code theyre going to be permitted some status, some subsidy thats going to allow them to survive because weve decided, that its constitutionally important to maintain these businesses? You dont argue that', 'You dont argue that.', 'Public radio, David.', 'But I cant tell the difference', 'betweenI cant tell the difference between, are you arguing that your institution should be maintained as they are now, or are you simply saying, I want to know I have a job when the New York Times goes under.  I mean is that the argument. [LAUGHTER]   Because the latter one Im not interested in.  The former one I am interested in, of course there are things about the New York Times, and there are qualities of the mainstream media that we want preserved.  They arent the core of those businesses', 'and the strategy for making those businesses profitable is not to do more of that, as weve amply demonstrated, they do less of that now', 'Luckily they arethey have been preserved, theres a lot of new media institutions that have the same values of fairness, of same values of accountability.  And thank God for it', 'Let me just say here is how  [APPLAUSE]', 'Sadly you used the worst case for endorsing the mainstream media.  The war was endorsed by the mainstream media in the United States, the war in Iraq was the worst moment of the mainstream media in the United States, similar to the', 'Alberto Gonzales period.  These were aspects of the Bush administration that were not questioned by the mainstream media, it was only much, much later, that the media stepped in and questioned those points.', 'And indeed', 'the mainstream media apologized for its endorsement of both the war and some of the tactics of the Bush administration, long after the fact.   The idea that you were on the front lines of being accountable to the government run amok under the Bush administration, is just completely at odds with the facts', 'No, no, no, Im not saying that, Im just saying', 'youre picking the wrong period of time to win a trophy for.', 'Yeah', 'Look, we are off the proposition.  Totally off the proposition. There would be total agreement on this stagepossibly not with Michael.  But  [LAUGHTER]  If the proposition was, Good riddance to journalism.  No one is saying that.  I would not participate on a panel that said Good riddance to journalism.', 'The mainright, there we go.  [APPLAUSE]  I know my colleagues.  What we are talking about is good riddance to a business model, that has a mixed record on the kinds of virtues that David Carr is talking about.   That is now going down the tubes for reasons that have to do with an economic transformation that is both productive and useful, and the idea of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater, that there is no alternative, Jim amply demonstrates that the alternative is emerging.  If its with partnerships with the mainstream media so be it, but it is a good thing, vote with the proposition.', '[UNCLEAR]', 'Well I would say that the deep pockets that supported one investigative series, which I applaud, was also used for other purposes, for the other 364 days of the year, so, the deep pockets are used for various things at various times.  Youif you exist under the illusion that the deep pockets merely support investigative journalism, then youre really supporting our point here.   Obviously we support and endorse the virtues of investigative journalism that holds institutions to account. But to say that the only delivery system for that is newspapers financed by shareholders in a corporate model, is to really ignore the present moment.  I think newspapers do a great job.  I think Politico.com does a great job.  I think any one individual platform is not the model.  And I think what were talking about here is a proliferation of platforms being a good thing, a transformational moment.   And if it makes some very, very well- paid people in the mainstream media worried, then, you know, thats the kind of worry that we journalists cut our teeth on it seems to me.', 'Well, again, I think what is the argument there, do we preserve an institution and do we choose which newspapers are worthy of having this subsidy to maintain their position?   And then are we to call them independent?  Are we to say that because now they are supported by the government, theyre supported by some sort of tax on say, television or Internet service providers that that revenue now flowing to those institutions makes them secure and independent in some sense thats going to make the journalism better?   No, I think what youve done there is create a jobs program for some great journalists and, lets hope they stick around.  But if they leave, theres absolutely no guarantee that the virtues that you talk about that are associated with the brand of those institutions, is going to remain.  What the only thing', 'But I think the mainstream media is at least as guilty of that as anything in the blogsphere, I mean it is the Fox News Network I believe that created a theme park out of a conspiracy of liberals taking over the world.  And  [LAUGHTER]  And so I think that model has worked for newspapers, as well as its worked for blogs, its certainly nothing that was invented by the Huffington Post.', 'Look, we stipulate that new media does not have the track record that the New York Times or the Houston Chronicle has because it is new media.  And, and indeed, if the metric is, what have you done for me over the last century, then new media will lose.  [LAUGHTER]   But what we are talking about is, what have you done for me lately.  [LAUGHTER]  And I think the question is that over time, mainstream media will have less ability to do what Katrina and David and Phil are talking about,  and new media will have more capacity to do it, and the intent is absolutely there, and the panel has not demonstrated that, for some reason, new media has no interest in the kinds of things youre talking about it, take Katrinas thing for just one moment. Shes describing how a woman reporter worked for six months on a story that saved lives, and thats getting more difficult now. I mean, imagine, at a small local paper in New Jersey, a reporter goes in to an editor and says, you know, Ive been working for a month on this story butits so difficult, I wish I was working for the New York Times. It would be so much easier if I was working for an organization with the deep pockets to support me, what would that editor say?  He would say go back and do your story.  Thats how journalism works.  The idea that this is tough, is not an argument, for them.  The idea that it is tough, is an argument for all the journalists who will continue to keep working regardless of whether the New York Times or the Washington Post go away tomorrow or not.', 'I think the question is much more profound than simply are there more registered Democrats in whatever sort of hall of the media that youre talking about.  What is happening here is that the editorial process is fundamentally shifting to your point. And to your point if, distribution means of information is taken away from a small number of institutions the diversity is naturally going to increase.  Further, if you have people who want to actually engage in the editorial process they dont go to one Twitter. You know, they go to sixty or they go to sixty different platforms. I mean, they are a part of the editorial process in the same way that people who buy Beatles Rock Band get to play Ringo, if they want to.  The idea is existentially being a part of the editorial process.  Truth telling and fact checking on their own is part of the experience that will become the business model of the future.  And if the mainstream media cant do that because their editorial process is closed theyre going to lose circulation exactly the way Jim is talking about here.  So were not abolishing journalists and were not abolishing newspapers.  We are talking about a fundamental shift that changes the way these institutions have managed to survive.  And good riddance to that.', 'So, David, thank you.  Now we know what those pilots on Flight 188 were doing in the cockpit.  [LAUGHTER]  Cutting out little, pictures from Newser.  I indeed am honored to be here with my colleagues and its great working once again with John Donvan. They have argued the point well.  They have made a lot of points that remind us, perhaps nostalgically, of the journalism that we all love and that we all want preserved up here. But you must vote against them and for the proposition for the following reasons:  Theyve not demonstrated that there is a way to stop the changes that are afoot.  In fact, theyve agreed that the changes are taking place.  Theres no way to stop them. They have not demonstrated how journalism is, in fact, going away under our model.  And they have not demonstrated that the current institutions they call the mainstream media are the only means for delivering quality journalism.  What do they say? It sounds sometimes theyre saying, We are going away.  Dont hate us.  Thats pathetic  [LAUGHTER]  and sad, but its not relevant.  It sounds like theyre saying, We are being abolished. Dont let them.  Well, thats simply untrue.  Theyre not being abolished.  And in fact, they would argue that we should be abolished or that the new media should be regulated so as to prevent their content from being used in new media and having access to readers. Finally, sometimes it seems like they are saying, We deserve to be protected, but they dont say how.  And because they dont you must vote against them.  They havent given us a practical reason why the mainstream media either should not go away or can be prevented from going away.  Finally, my brilliant colleague David Carr would have you believe that the New York Times started on this island with Pulitzer prize winning journalists who said, We gotta start this paper to confront the government.  And thats not what happened. They started selling, they sold a lot, they made a lot and the core values of the New York Times arose out of their success.  The moment has passed.  Vote for the proposition.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['[UNDER APPLAUSE]  Thank you.  Im here to tell you that you not only look young, you look good too.  [LAUGHTER]  And I urge you to vote for the proposition because, to be blunt, I think new media is better than old media, and I think that were the hope for them.   I thinkI agree with most of what Phil said, I agree that all that investment, all the accountability that old journalism has done, is great and that we need those values. But theres also another side to mainstream media and another side to new media. For starters, mainstream media, for the longest time, I dont think it was always as good as portrayed or always as great as we sort of mythicize.  And, for the longest time it was basically run by old white men who are left of center who are deciding how all of us view the news, the only diversity was how much hair they had left or whether they drank gin or scotch. [LAUGHTER]   And what new medias done is its injected a ton of vitality and a ton of competition into the media.  And its also created, it gives you ideological, racial, and gender diversity that we never had before, and it gives all of us, all us news junkies, everyone in this room obviously cares a lot about news  It gives us a whole new menu of information to choose from.  I also think, Imy background is I worked at the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post and then we started Politico three years ago, so I think Ive seen both sides of it. And I can tell you theres probably a lot of businessmen and women in the audience because this is New York.  And I think, I think your stomach would be turned if you went into some newspapers to see how theyre run, because they had profits that were so high for so long, an almost like not-for-profit mentality took on and there became distance between the institutions that were covering the news and the readers.   And I think that, it led to a real disconnect between what institutions were producing and what readers wanted, and I saw this all the time when I was at those institutions, and when I was there three years ago at the Washington Post and I include myself in that, I saw online, I saw the Web as a nuisance, I wanted to write front-page stories for a newspaper, despite the fact that I could look at the Web metrics and see that I was getting 10 or 20 times as many people reading my story online, that thats where people wanted the news. And I think that creates a culture that I dont think works for the modern news consumer.  And what new medias done is its ripped down that wall, between the institution and the reader, and its opened up, I think its made it more transparent and its allowed you the reader to participate more in what were doing and even some of you to participate in the journalism that were doing.   I also want to clear up some of the myths about new media, because I think all the things that Phil said are really important and I thinkyou always have to remember that new media is in its infancy and that, its going to grow and its going to mature.   And youre going to hear stuff tonight about how theres a demise of serious journalism, that you know, that if you look online, if you look at new media its just not as serious and substantive. Ive been in Washington for 15 years, and I would say that the coverage of the health care debate, has been the most substantive, the deepest coverage, the most accountable coverage that Ive seen of a domestic policy issue in some time. And the best of it is coming not from the mainstream media, but from outside of the mainstream media.  Whether its Jonathan Cohn from The New Republic or Ezra Klein whos doing his stuff sort of deep down in the WashingtonPost.com,  whether its Politico where we have three or four reporters just doing the policy element, we have investigative reporters doing the accountability element.  Huffington Post often has their reporters dispatched to this issue.  Dedicates a lot of its home page to this issue. You have Propublica, a not-for-profit organization run by Paul Steiger who I used to work with at the Wall Street Journal, and the Center for Public Integrity, doing some accountability reporting and making that available to readers throughout the country.   You have the Kaiser Foundationwhich has stepped in and has started to produce non-partisan news about the health care debate, a lot of it about the human element of it, they have 20 reporters, that stuffs available to any newspaper that wants to run it, so for people who care, theres more information than ever, and its coming mostly from new media. Youre also going to hear about the demise of foreign coverage. And I think thats a serious problem.  But we didnt start this fire.  It was dying before new media ever came along, its really expensive to do foreign coverage.  And guess who is actually creating that bridge until we can figure out how to finance it. Its new media.  Its Global Post which was started by some folks over at the Boston Globe.  They have 65 reporters around the country that are doing work on a freelance basis in every corner of the country.  During the aftermath of the Iranian debate which was mentioned in Phils column, or in Phils comments. The best coverage was often online, Huffington Post took the above-the-fold part of its home page, and the Huffington Post gets more traffic now than the Washington Post, and dedicated it to a running blog where you had video and text and audio coming in from Iran, so you could have a peek into what was happening on the streets that you never couldve had in the old days, and I think that is a good thing.   Andrew Sullivan was doing a similar thing on his blog.  He had 1.2 million visitors in one day, which is more than you would get people reading a newspaper, all but the top three newspapers that are out there. David Wood, who is married to someone that works at Politico -- he was a foreign policy reporter covering Afghanistan on the ground. Got laid off because of cutbacks at mainstream media.  Who hired him?  Its American Online Politics Daily.  Its new media thats giving these people a chance to do journalism.  And I do believe that as new media matures, were going to take over that social responsibility of funding the expensive to do journalism, like accountability and like foreign policy reporting because you cant cover anything if youre not in business.  And I think that its new media thats going to crack the code on the business models that actually work.   Youre also going to hear from that side on the demise of accountability and investigative reporting. I think new media is leading the charge and theyre leading it by keeping all the mainstream media reporters employed. A lot of the best people in the business --  Bill Hamilton was Bob Woodwards editor at the Washington Post, one of the best editors in Washington --  we, he just came over to Politico to help do our investigative stories and our longer form stories.   Huffington Post started the Investigative Fund, which is a not-for-profit arm that does investigative reporting.  Its going to be run by Larry Roberts, who is running investigations for the Washington Post. Propublica, which I mentioned a little bit earlier, has thirty-three reporters, including Jeff Gerth from the New York Times, and many other people have been doing investigative reporting for a long time. I mentioned Talking Points Memo, and Phil was saying, Well, can they make money?  Is there an ability for them to finance the type of journalism that takes on government?  Well, I think so. They just got another round of funding.  Theyre doubling the size of their staff.  Theyre starting a Washington bureau and theyre predicting that they can get to a path to profitability.  And I believe that because Politicos done it.  In year three, with a hundred and twenty employees, doing that type of journalism, were profitable.  And I think it proves that this works.  So I urge all of you to vote for the, the resolution because new media has given journalism the tools, the tricks, the metabolism and the journalists to succeed.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]', 'because its a young crowd', 'Can new media fact-check mainstream media for a second, because there are profitable models, Politico in its third year, 120 employees', 'come on David, David', 'David profitable.  Doing serious nonpartisan journalism.  The Huffington Post which you can argue is partially aggregator, is not profitable now but if you look at its traffic which this month surpassed the Washington Post, if they werent in a heavy investment mode, could probably be profitable.   What youre also forgetting to know, to note, is that its early, were all trying to figure out the business model, we havent even started to charge for content.   Trust me, people, youre going to be paying for content [LAUGHTER], a lot of it is going to be new media content, and I think the whole argument over here is, were not saying get rid of mainstream media altogether, were saying, get rid of it, get rid of it the way youve been!  [LAUGHTER]   The reason you guys are arguing that you survive or that people should vote with you is that by adopting all of our techniques, by getthe speed, the transparency, the openness, the Twitter, all of the things that are thriving in new media, thatswere equipping some of the mainstream media institutions, to have at least a chance of survival and there arent that many', 'Pardon, I think they are, I do think theyre on our side without knowing it.  And I think they would privately concede that theyre on our side.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]', 'Well we justwe keep hearing about that, you were just talking a little bit about the echo chamber like its just noise and people are amplifying positions that they already have and theres a lot of misinformation out there.  But whos doing the fact-checking, some of the best fact-checkings being done by new media. Factcheck.org, which I think is the name of the arm of the St. Petersburg Times which won a Pulitzer Prize for its fact- checkingthat online, that new media component made the old media relevant, whos been fact-checking, who was quickest to fact-check the death panels and all the other nonsense that weve had in different debates in recent months. Its websites like ours, its the Huffington Post.  Its various bloggers who are checking this stuff in real time, and theyre setting the record straight, and I think that thats a fabulous, advance.  Is there a bigger burden on you as the reader right now than there was, 10 years ago, when five people at the three big networks and the two big newspapers told you how to view world events?  Yes.  But I think theres so much more information now for you to consume, thanks to new media, that youre a much more educated consumer of news and you can make probably a much, a better decision based on the facts.', 'We applaud what the Houston paper is doing, we applaud what the Las Vegas paper is doing, but I think when you decide that youre going to vote for the proposition, one of the things you have to keep in mind is that it is a false argument to say that this cannot and will not be done by the new media.   You were talking about how you recall the this Las Vegas series.  I recall Talking Points Memo doing a series of pieces on the series of firings of US Attorneys under Bush and was relentless in doing it, and wasand did a great job of using the technology that new medias created, to be able to get more documents, get more information and over time, build up a story that forced other people to reckon with and, and got attention and made a difference and I think increasingly', 'Increasingly', 'And using a lot of like, the information thats coming in [UNCLEAR]', 'I dont think your opponents are against that.', 'Were just saying that it doesnt', 'Im saying', 'Too late. WOMAN IN AUDIENCE So I think a lot of this conversation has been about capacity capacity to provide good reporting, integrity around reporting, accurate reporting.  And I think everyone here would agree that, theres a lot of respect for places like Huffington Post and Politico.com.   That you all have the capacity, or are at least thinking about developing the capacity to provide that quality control.  Im curious about, um, what about the other, all the other mechanisms on the Internet that dont necessarily have the capacity, nor are interested in developing the capacity to provide that quality control.   So the Twitters, the Facebooks, the YouTubes where you, you log in to something and they actually say, this is whats happening, but its folks, I had an experience so I downloaded something from YouTube', 'Crazy people arent a new invention.  Theyve been around for a long time, people who tell lies have been around for a long time, people who think crap information is true, have been around for a long time.  And I think thatwhat youre going to see, it does put more of a burden on you, and Ill keep coming back to this because there is so much information, you have to figure out what you trust.   The reason that Im optimistic is I feel like new media is going to solve that for you, its not going to be old media, its going to be new models in your local communication, it might not be a paper that has four or five hundred employees. It might be a series of three or four smaller websites that do very specialty reporting in those communities, some might be not-for- profit, some might be ad-supported, some might be paid content. But thats going to happen.  And its happening nowthats why Im optimistic that together we can figure this out, we are figuring this out. And theres a reason that mainstream media is losing readers, they lost touch with their readers, theres a reason, look at the circulation numbers that just came out.  Across the board they lost 10 percent.  Some newspapers lost a much higher percent, in six months, theyre just losing the readers because they didnt retool and they didnt start trying to get news to you the way that you wanted, maybe you want it on Twitter, maybe you  want it on Facebook, maybe you want it in a newspaper, maybe you want it online.  Its companies like ours and I think companies in new media that are figuring that out and are going to be the ones that continue to provide that and continue to fact-check for you.', 'I would urge you to vote for the proposition and I think when youre about to vote you should think about their argument. Because I think theyre making a pretty powerful argument for us.  What they want you to believe is that the mainstream media is something that its not.  They want, they use words like hybrid or advancement or transformation.  Theyre basically trying to argue that they are new media and theyre not.  The culture is different, the metabolisms different.  I think its emphatically clear that not only is new media superior, I think its our only hope for saving timely, serious, revelatory and profitable news. So I say, Good riddance to the slow, detached, monolithic mainstream media, which weve had for the past twenty years. And I say that new media, we should respect the things that these guys have talked about.  We do respect the values of fairness and accuracy.  But I also think that all of us in this room should embrace the diversity, the transparency, the timeliness and the innovative spirit that you see in new media. Thats where the optimism is.  Thats where the ideas are.  Thats where our, for us news junkies, thats where salvation is.  I urge you to remember that new media is very much in its infancy. And we can sort of laugh it off and we can talk about baby water, all we want.  But new media is working out its flaws.  Our people balance better the serious with the superficial.  Everyones aware that thats an issue. People are grappling with it and it will be solved.  And we will fill the role of, the traditional role of a public servant.  You cant do public service journalism, investigative reporting or foreign policy unless you make money or unless you have government subsidy or unless you have a not-for-profit status.  You have to make money to be able to support doing the foreign coverage, to support doing the investigative coverage.  Im proud to say that profit, that Politico is, in its third year, profitable and that soon well be able to do more and more funding of the type of investigative reporting that we all love.  We all share that. Nobody is disputing that value.  So with all that in mind I think its abundantly clear that you should vote in favor of the proposition because the news depends on it.']\n",
      "['Well, also to make me rich.', 'Oh yes, of course.', 'Always', 'I went to work for the New York Times in 1973, and I was going to say that that probably makes me one of the people whos been in this business in this room the longest.  But then I notice youre an old crowd.  [LAUGHTER]  My  [LAUGHTER]   My mother went to work as a daily reporter in 1942, my father began as an ad man in 1946, after the war.  So, the thing that I know is that this business is always changing.  So, the idea that somebody is going to defend the status quo of this business is to me a little silly.   And my first point is, that we ought to remember, that this business, the business that those guys are going to defend, is a new creation.  Its at most, 20 years old. And its essentially  And the other thing thats going to happen is that theyre going to talk about the news business, and thats not the proposition,  the proposition is the media business as it should be, because the news business has been subsumed by this superstructure.  Now this superstructure, which essentially is five companies which dominate the landscape  Time Warner, Viacom-CBS, Newscorp, Disney, and NBC Universal. What these companies are arelisten to thismore than 1,000 independent media companies, which in the past 20 years have been aggregated into five.  So what theyre going to be defending, is actually a business theory.  And the theory is we bring all these companies together, and we create value.   Heres the point.  That theory has been all but utterly exploded.  Disproven. Break it down into its component parts.  Look at its constituencies.  From an audience point of view, the audience has been in flight for 20 years.  Just yesterday, what weve learned is that there was, newspapers have lost another 10 percent of circulation, some newspapers are down in a year, 25 percent.   You can see those numbers not just in newspapers, across the media landscape.  Television networks, books, magazines, the music business, the movie business.  And now the cable business.  People are in flight from what was supposed to be the bastion of mainstream media. This is an extraordinary moment, it is a moment in which you see literally breakdown at every level.  The  You haveits not onlyyou have an audience flight, you have an advertiser flight. What happens with advertisers, it used to be that consumer brands, you had 90 percent of consumer brand spending was in the mainstream media, thats down to under 50 percent, why is that the case.  Because it doesnt work anymore.   You have from a shareholder perspective, and this is key.  Shareholder perspective, what you have iswell actually youve been screwed if youre a shareholder [LAUGHTER] in a modern media company.  Media moguls rich, shareholders across the spectrum of these companies, are underwater, not one of these companies, in 20 years has kept pace with the S&P. This is a devastating result.  What you have is your customers, yourthe consumer, the advertiser, and the marketplace itself, saying that there is something phenomenally wrong here. Technology.  The media is a technology business.  Thats what it is.  Thats what it has always been.  Technology changes, the media changes.  There is no media without technology.  Were Weve come to a funny moment however in this business because the mainstream media is run by people who are fundamentally technology-phobes. They dont get it, they dont want to get it, theyre averse to it, they resist it.  They are lost when it comes to making plans about it.  I spent a lotta time in the recent past with Rupert Murdoch who runs I would say the leading-edge media company, and he runs it with an iron fist.   He doesnt run it with a computer because he doesnt use one, he doesnt run it with email because he doesnt get email.  And he cant get that cell phone to work, hes always kind of waving itin the air. [LAUGHTER]  What youre going to hear here tonight is that the media is necessary for the commonweal.   An informed citizenry is what this nation is about.  The media may be flawed but it delivers us what we need to know.  That is self-serving crap. [LAUGHTER]   I  [INSTANT OF APPLAUSE, DIN OF VOICES] The New York Times, is a good newspaper, sometimes.  The Washington Post is a good newspaper.  The LA Times before it became a bad newspaper was a good newspaper.  [LAUGHTER] But after that, its off the cliff, its oblivion.  The news business in this country is nothing to be proud of.  What  You know, I think the thing to remember hereI mean the really important thing is that something else is happening, something is  This is easy.  Changeand I have four secondschange is good.  And its happening and we are part of it, and were going to all tell our grandchildren that, we were here, we saw the monster die, and we saw the shock of the new', 'And  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you.', 'Katrina.

Now in youreverything youve said is incredibly noble, and its good, I wish it would happen, but its not the media business.

And I thought about this for a long time and Ithen I thoughtwell, where was the Boston Globe for the 30 years this was going on? [LAUGHTER]  And, this is one of those things, yes, we know.

But you put out terrible newspapers and youve put out terrible newspapers for at least half a century, so, the question is should we fight to preserve Hearst newspapers and again I love the people at Hearst and you put out some good magazines, et cetera, et cetera.  But I dont think anyone wants to make the case for Hearst newspapers', 'or for any', 'of the chain newspapers', 'Yeah, but thats not even what would happen, if I can argue with people on my own sideside.  [LAUGHTER]  If they went in, if that person in New Jersey went in and said Ive been working on this for a month and its really hard, what would the editor say, the editor would say forget it, okay, its over, done with, lets get on to something else.', 'Ive asked before how theyre going to do it.  If they want to save, the mainstream media they gotta have a plan other than a government bailout.  Phil says we want the mainstream media to die, thats what were advocating.  Thats not the case.  What were saying is that the mainstream media is dying.  And its, going to die because things have changed.  Its become obsolete. There is new technology.  So even if we wanted to preserve it and most of my day is spent in the mainstream media and I would love to preserve it another year, another couple of years.  Many of us about whether we will make it to retirement.  I think actually we wont.  And I think thats what we are trying to say here.  Its not to deny anything about the mainstream media -- its virtues or its faults.  Its just to acknowledge that something new has happened, a change is here.  The mainstream media now is functionally Detroit.  So actually, it can probably go on. It can limp on and on and on.  And then it wont be able to limp on anymore.   Remember, we are all journalists here.  We are arguing for our livelihoods.  Theyre arguing for their livelihoods. We are arguing for a new version of our livelihoods.  But what you should focus on is the other people, the people we serve.  We serve readers, we serve advertisers and we serve shareholders. And the mainstream media has failed in that regard and theres no picking up the pieces.']\n",

      "['Thanks  Thank you, while I have a chance to pay tribute to my boss and colleague, Steve Coll, on the blogging front, Steve writes the blog Think Tank for The New Yorker, you should go check it out, I hope Steve writes about this.  Steve was commended the other day by Senator John McCain at a forum in Washington. John McCain said to everyone go read Ghost Wars, and as it turns out Barack Obamas been carrying a text of Ghost Wars around for about 11 months.  I think its the most carried-around book that Obama has had, if he would just finish it we might get somewhere. [LAUGHTER]   I also want to take a moment to pay tribute to Kati Marton whos a member of our board of directors and happens to be married to one Richard Holbrooke.  Richard Holbrooke is in my view one of the most tenacious and effective results-deliverers in the global justice community.  I put myself somewhat in the realist community, but I dontI generally criticize some of the goals of the global justice community, for not being able to set priorities, not being able to set plans, not being able to pursue things to their end. And Richard Holbrooke does do this.  My problem, and why Im on this side of the aisle from my friend and colleague Steve Coll, is that very few people in the Obama administration are like Richard Holbrooke, or can frame the debate in Pakistan and Afghanistan like Steve Coll just did.  And this concerns me.  If you speak to people of responsibility within an administration, clarity of objectives and how youre going to get there, the game plan, being not only able to explain to the American public why were doing something, but to be able to create internal plans that help you execute consistent direction is vital.   And that clarity of direction has not been in place and it wasnt until the leak of General McChrystals report, in my view, that you began to see higher prioritization of the Afghanistan question.  That is a lousy way to tell the world that were under good management in the United States.   A few years ago I was in China.  I went to see the equivalent of the policy planning staff in China, said what are you folks working on.  And they said how to keep you guys distracted in small Middle Eastern countries.  [LAUGHTER]   And as weve moved from the problems in Iraq, we now have moved to a problem in South Asia, and very often we talk about as Steve Coll did, the drama that envelops the South Asian region, the very important promise the United States has in possibly trying to achieve a new equilibrium there.   But let me ask you all a question, how many of you look at China, whether youre concerned about its security forces or indebtedness, as a major issue for the United States, just raise your quick hand.   Okay, how hands down.  How many of you look at in the Middle East, what is unfolding with Iran, Irans nuclear intentions, as a significant, really giant hurdle for the United States.   How many of you look at Russia, some of you look at Russia and whats been unfolding in NATO as a major issue. Probably a fewer number, but theyre out there.', 'Yes', 'I am seeing lots and lots of hands go up, lots of concern.  And let me tell you  [LAUGHTER]  The issue, the issue here today, is one, whether the United States after eight years of failing to move the needle, in fact seeing the needle come back on itself very dramatically, is convincing the world today that it can achieve the objectives it sets out for itself.  I think Barack Obama has inherited one of the worst economic and national security portfolios of any President in American history.   We are not starting out at the same starting point that George Bush was starting out.  Youre starting out in majorin a major hole, in a major deficit.  And how we conduct our primary goals and objectives, has huge consequence on the way our allies see us, and whether they depend on us or not, and it also has consequences on our foes and their behaviors,  and I would argue today, that the equilibrium, the general equilibrium that the United States had around the world, has been broken, and the tectonics of global affairs have shifted around so dramatically, that as we find ourselves bogged down, into very large goals, which I think are commendable goals, but were not achieving them, were convincing Iran not to negotiate in a fair and honest way, we are convincing Russia to continue to move its objectives.  We are convincing China, that were increasingly a basket case.  We China would have to finance this war.  Were paying $65 billion a year at current levels.  And thats before the add-ons, just in military terms in Afghanistan today.  That does not include what our allies are spending militarily, nor does it include the non- military expenditures.   Ladies and gentlemen, that number is bigger than the entire GDP of Afghanistan.  We could buy the whole place, we could put everyone to work.  We could do a Marshall Plan in the region for something very different.  My worry about a lot of the steps that weve taken in Afghanistan is that were finding ourselves increasingly in a civil war, in which the Pasthun opposition which is the home base for the Taliban, actually sees us increasingly as occupiers and controllers, and I worry about our inability to disentangle that.  Now there are others who have written, and Les Gelb did so recently in a Daily Beast article, Les Gelb the former, well-respected head of the Council on Foreign Relations, said its time for the United States to find a way to turn this not just into a NATO war, and an American war, but an Afghan war with other stakeholders.   Particularly countries like Russia and China and other stakeholders in the region where they can come in, and actually feel as if this matters to them too.  That the instability there is happening, we are right now back into, while we have allies, back into a sense that this is our game.  And we have some slightly reluctant fellow travelers from NATO helping us, and were achieving none of the big, progressive goals that I think that we should be able to.   And so as we look at this, we look at the cost and we look at how were operating in Afghanistan, I think its very important to look at the consequences on US society and what its achieved elsewhere in the world.  Jim Jones, President Obamas national security advisor, just said, that we have succeeded in diminishing al-Qaedas resonance and its robustness, both in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and he said, that there is no imminent threat of a Taliban takeover.   Now, this is quite different than General McChrystals report and I have to say, that General McChrystal has probably written in my personal view, one of the most stark and realistic and probably accurate assessments of the mess in Afghanistan today.   I disagree with the prescription because I dont have confidence and faith in the ability of the Presidential leadership to get this right.  My colleagues on the other aisle, are going to argue that it can.  But, at some point you have to pull the plug, and say that it is time that we begin to move in a different direction.  We need a consistent voice, consistent leadership, that is not happening.  Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]', 'May I', 'A colleague of mine and Steve Colls, Peter Bergen, who would no doubt be arguing on the other side of the panel, made an interesting point the other day in that the tragic death of these I believe 10 troops that were killed in an external outpost   The similar thing had been done in the past and there were hundreds of pages of review documents by the US military done to sort of prevent exactly what happened, that there was supposed to be pre- positioning of menof equipment and a concern that this not replay.   This gets at the issue Ive been getting at, it is regardless of the merit of what you would like to try and achieve, the costs of the collective failure of the counterinsurgency approach of the months that have been under the Obama  I mean the Obama administration came in in a period where, the concern for upgrading of the forces at that time was linked to the spring offensive.  Then there was the increase of 21,000 troops to make Afghans safe, Afghanistan safe for voters, and we needed to get through the August 30th elections.  And then we see dire predictions of the meltdown of Afghanistan, again you  We see a constant tick up, but no real serious competence in either generating a consistency of what objectives were at, whoever you talk to in the administration, if its DOD one day, State another USID on another, theyre not on the same page.  And then we have the tragic death of these soldiers, in something where the military had studied and not deployed the reforms it said it needed to do', 'Its a mess.', 'I would take on the Bush administration as well, they had seven years of this.  [APPLAUSE]', 'The queshey, guys', 'we dont yet know which government that is', 'I mean II hope that', 'we', 'I mean, binary debates, are always complicated but I hope we can stay away from sloganeering, Im not therethe other day General David Patraeus said that one of his concerns, was that people would think that what happened in Iraq would be easily moved that he thinks all the time about the tyranny of the mind, that one would get stuck in one framework that might not approach the others,  so General Petraeus actually raised many of the same questions that we are about the applicability of the counterintelligencebut lets take your manual for a minute, your manual as you know, and Ive learned a lot about it from you, argues for a forced deployment which is staggering, but more important, of that staggering force deployment it argues that of the resources deployed, 80 percent of those should be civilian, 20 percent should be military.   And I have to tell you that everything we see percolating out of the military analysis is calling for a 99.999 percent military approach to this.  That only animates Pashtun tribalism, Pashtun concern over occupation.   It animates and it has built a blob, which were increasingly calling the Taliban. Were not able to defuse that, and were not able to get the convertibility.  Ive talked to various people that', 'I have read a significant portion of it', 'but I', '[the resource allocations that hes calling togo ahead.', 'Well, let me just', 'Ralph, can we get another voice', 'I think that its dangerous, and sometimes counterproductive to look at questions and just in binary terms, that either you stay and you produce outcomes, you leave and you produce great consequences.  Sometimes those scenarios, there are probably, Steve Coll and I talk about this, six or seven different scenarios that, I think for the sake of the health of American society we ought to talk about more systematically, in what you can achieve, but some things that I would put on the table because I respect all the gentleman on the other side is that sometimes, we look very blindly and with an interesting kind of confidence about the ability of the US military to sort of earnestly and proactively go and create and shape outcomes.   But it reminds me of trade deficits in economics, where frequently we look at GDP growth, we tend to not look at the current account deficit.  We tend to look at what we generate and we tend not to look at some of the negatives and draw down.  And what I fear is that theres a blind spot in a lot of this discussion, about the down-side consequences of the size of the military footprint, in places that are very, very hostile to the narrative of colonialism, control, and that we dont think about other ways to achieve some of the goals we might want to do, and so the question is efficacy, and actually getting efficacious outcomes, what I said about Richard Holbrooke.  I was in a briefing with Richard Holbrooke [UNCLEAR] and I cant talk about the substance of it, other than I can talk about, he is doing some absolutely fascinating things, in a whole broad variety of areas but one of the areas in agriculture.   Moving a lot of the poppy-growers into other areas. You can sort of look at transparent, tangible results, changing the sort of lives and direction but, let me tell you', 'just quickly, let meJim, let me just finish.  The Taliban today, are delivering to their people, and this is a problem for us, accountability in political management.  Courts, property rights, security, trade, ombudsmen.  They are miserable on human rights, you would never want to be a woman living in those areas, and I think that its a night it would be a nightmarish life on other fronts but in terms of the priorities people have, theyre there.  I talked to a Dubai businessman the other day who was telling me', 'Yeah.  Well', 'I want to seriously pull back', 'Yeah', 'So glad you asked', 'So glad I was asked, what I would like to see first of all [LAUGHTER] is for the administration, the Obama administration to get itself all on one page, and decide what it is about and what its achievedtrying to achieve.  That clarity has been absent.  I think with all due respect [APPLAUSE] to Barack Obama, whom I supported as well, Barackthe concern that many of our allies have had in this is that Barack Obamas eye has not been on the Afghanistan ball since March.  It is now.   And I look for informed leadership, particularly since hes reading Steve Colls book. [LAUGHTER]  But let me tell you what I said, I intimated some of the other things that need to be done.  We need to make this not an American war in Afghanistan, it needs other major stakeholders, and not just NATO.  [APPLAUSE]', 'If they dont come in', 'I know, this is a George W. Bush line, but Chinas not there, Russias not there, there is not the broad stakeholders that I think matter', 'Its an important symbolic partnership, but when it comes to the substantive, pushing the needle on whats going onI dont want to denigrate anyone elses role--it is not enough.  Again this is not about, sloganeering, its not about--that Im trying to make an assessment that the kind of weight that you need, consequential weight, to basically try and create an equilibrium there, remains absent.', 'And let me add', 'John, 41 countries', 'John, there are 193 nations in the world', 'you can play numbers games', 'This is not, I mean, honestly, the', '[UNCLEAR] our greatest legacy', 'of our vision there', 'is leaving the military?', 'Yeah, well', 'Let me just say that would just be very bleak.', 'I think', 'I think what Steve Coll just shared is true, but theres also another truth in Pakistan, where, you get equations like the ally of our ally turns out to be our enemy.  And to some degree, there was a time when I had lunch with the former head of ISI and I was late to the lunch like I often am and didnt know it was the former head of ISI', 'ISI is thewhats it stand for, the', 'Interservice Intelligence, theyre the bad guys CIA in, theyre the intelligence services.', 'And theyre off, they are rumored to have helped seed the terrorist groups in Mumbai and they are active with some elements of the Taliban.   And I asked this general, I said does President Musharraf, then-President Musharraf control the ISI and this General Jurani [PH] told me that President Musharraf has a lot to gain by acting like he doesnt.   And, in that kind of world, its, as Steve Coll knows better than anyone else, you have a problem where were not always quite sure where the security apparatus of that state is.  And that regardless, and I agree completely that something interesting has been achieved in Pakistan, so let them have it.   Let them become their own barriers to Islamic jihadism and the most extreme elements of their societies.  And I think if youre fair with Pakistan society theyve done a fairly good job of keeping the minority extreme parties  Islamist parties have been kept a minority in their political system.  Let that continue to percolate, I dont think its quite as vulnerable at even the point where we were worried before the Swat offensive.  So, to a certain degree thats there but I also worry about the fact that, the ISI may be taking us for a ride again, where we dont quite know when theyre going to push buttons that actually destabilize the situation. I think Steve is right to say we have an opportunity to maybe get a deal, a grand bargain.   But I have some concerns about that, just given the behaviors weve seen, and our own lack of contact with a whole range of managers, colonels and majors, within the ISI today that maybe Pat Lang needs to go over and spend some time with but', 'I have a lot of doubts about that equation and the stability of it.', 'America will not succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan unless it gets its act back together both on the questions of management and strategy, both of which it has failed miserably in over the last eight years with regard to this challenge.   The issue is not just Afghanistan and Pakistan, its the bigger picture, of what is going on in the United States, rewriting to some degree Americas place in the world in what I think is a historic moment of opportunity but discontinuity with the past.   Barack Obama has a huge challenge. The mystique of Americas superpower status was somewhat shattered by Iraq, where other nations saw our limits, our military limits, our economic limits, and our moral limits.  All of that has to be reinvented.   And while Ive heard great arguments from our colleagues on the other side, I have not seen a general understanding that we need to begin thinking about the sort of place and mission we have 20 or 30 or 40 years out.   We havent discussed nearly enough what alternative strategies might actually generate a better human-rights regime, better opportunities for women democratic rights that weve seen fail miserably I think in the recent elections, under our management.  We were the stewards of that election that just unfolded, in great degree and to someand I think no matter where you look, turned out to be quite a bad deal.  And trying to restore Americas place and the sense that America has leverage over important global affairs, is really vital in dealing with nuclear nonproliferation.   Iran, recreating some sense that we have consequence and weight.  So its not just about Afghanistan and Pakistan, being stuck in the mud there, and not coming up, and just having a strategy that throws more troops at the challenge, without saying how can you get to some consistent level of benchmarks that are shared within a team both military and on the smart power side of the equation.   Until thats done, I cant see in any way that sending more resources into that fixes those management mistakes.']\n",
      "['Well ladies and gentlemen, its a great pleasure to be here with you, this is a fascinating topic at this particular moment in American history.  And I wouldve thought maybe that people were tired of it by now but I can see that that is obviously not the case.  Now as the chairman said, in fact I dont think this you can decide that question other than in the context of what itwhether or not youre going to succeed, other than in the context of what American policy is and what the stated foreign policy of the President of the United States is with regard to this question.   Thats  I had the fortune or misfortune to go to any number of Army service schools, one of them was the Army War College, where they taught me a lot about the strategy of planning itself, you started with the mission, national purpose, you have a policy, and then you devise a strategy from that. then you implement that strategy.  Thats how it works. Now, last March I listened carefully when President Obama announced that our policy in Afghanistan was to disrupt, destroy, and disorganize our enemies, our specific enemies who were a danger to the United States.  Thats a nice clear policy, you know, its not too hard to understand that.   And to that end, General Stanley McChrystal was put in command out there, and sent out to make what is called a commanders estimate of the situation. Which he did, with a lot of help from various people for several months and it is now as you know, the object of great contention in the Washington world.  And the problem with his estimate, I think, that is causing so much trouble, is that it is normal in an estimate of that kind for a commander to propose several options to his superior, among which the boss can choose.  To present only one option, in this case the option of a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign, across all of the really hostile parts of Afghanistan in the context of their ruined, if ever alive economy, and their obviously rather feeble political system, is a daunting task.   But somehow it has become-- what we would call an implied task for General McChrystal, that the pacification of large parts of Afghanistan and the most hostile places are in fact a necessary thing.   And for that reason, he has opted for counterinsurgency.  Now, I am happy to see so many members of my generation out here in the audience. There are usually too many young people for my taste. [LAUGHTER]    But  I started in the counterinsurgency business in the church of the counterinsurgents, really.  In 1964, if you can believe that, when the Army sent me down to Fort Bragg to study this subject with intensity and at the feet of the most learned French and British exponents of this theory of warfare which had been created as a result of the experience of the former colonial powers in World War II in fighting against the wars of national liberation as they were called then.   And the Communists had gotten involved in all these wars so we were against all this as well, so we studied up on this in a big way, and one of the most interesting of the guys who taught from the stage there was a great, a great scholar named Bernard Fall.  Bernard Fall.   Some of you undoubtedly know who that is.  And I remember watching him, I of course I had no real idea who he was at the time but I remember him, watching him writewrite on a blackboard on the stage, Counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic development plus counter-guerilla operations. Counterinsurgency equals political reform plus economic development plus counter-guerilla operations.   And thats really all of it right there, thats all of it in a nutshell.  And it is in that context that when you look at Afghanistan, this huge place thats the size of Texas with 35 million people of very disparate origins, many of them speaking languages that are not mutually intelligible, and who dont like each other, a lot of them, very much, in fact you can see, that this is a very difficult thing to do.  We tried applying this theory of warfare, counterinsurgency, across the world in the 1960s and 70s and 80s and I did it myself in South America, in East Africa and Southwest Asia and all kinds of places, and of course Vietnam, how could I forget that.  And we found that in places where the task wasnt too big, you know, the country wasnt too big, the problems werent manageable one way or another, or people werent thoroughly converted to some ideology that demanded revolution, that you could do this, by enough good works and suppression of guerillas you could turn this around, and I could name places if we had time.  In places that were eerily big and where none of those conditions applied, weyou could struggle like the devil but you wouldnt get very far, you know.   And Ithis is the problem I have with the idea of the application of counterinsurgency, those three things, to Afghanistan, I know that was four things.  In fact, I think that is too big a task for us.  We have been fighting for eight years, Afghanistan is a huge place, it has terrible problems, economic ones, political ones.   And the combat problem, from the point of view of a guy who fought in several wars like this including Vietnam, is really very difficult. And I would submit to you that if what were going to do as General McChrystal says, were going to try to protect the people, which means essentially, control the population because thats what counterinsurgency is about,  just like insurgency is about controlling the population either with positive means, or means not so positive, sometimes, youre going to have to have a lotta troops to do this.  I mean General McChrystal evidently wants 40,000 more people.   Well I would say to you that thats just the beginning.  Thats how we started in Vietnam too.  This is a big problem were facing in Afghanistan.  And in fact, this slice of the pie will be followed by further slices of the pie.   And my objection to all this is, and the reason why I dont think we can win with a counterinsurgency strategy, is in fact because I think that, three or four years down the pike, if we apply that strategy, all you good people, and your fellow citizens across the country are going to look at this, going to say, are the Taliban, or whatever it is were calling the Taliban, are they really our enemies, in the sense that al-Qaeda was?  Is this really what we want to do?  And when that happens, I suspect that whats going to happen is youre going to tell your members of Congress that youve had enough of this, and then they will vote the end of the war as they did in Vietnam.   So I dont think we can do this, I dont think we can do counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, there are other methods that could be applied, that would control the situation there over a long period of time, I dont think we can withdraw altogether.  But counterinsurgency in Afghanistan I find to be a very difficult idea.  Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, to begin with, it was, I did appreciate the fact that sacred scripture was brought to the meeting here so it could be read to us. [LAUGHTER]  In fact these words inscribed in that manual are in fact the same doctrine that we used in the 1960s and 70s across the world.   And as I said, we had a varying pattern of success depending on how tough the opposition was and how long we were willing to stick with it.   With regard to Iraq, with the greatest of respect to Colonel Nagl,  I would submit in fact that whatever it is that people call the surge, people are creating these fanciful concepts with single words as a public relations gimmick.  The surge, what was the surge, an increase of 30,000 troops or so, in Iraq for some period of time?  That was certainly useful in the Baghdad area in the context of Iraqi neighborhoods that had been largely cleansed ethnically or at least in a sectarian way, and then a lotta walls were built to separate these people, that worked very well indeed.   But I would submit to you that what really worked out in Anbar, in the places where he said-- in other places in Iraq-- was the fact that we adopted a very simple, old-fashioned tool that has been used in the Middle East from time immemorial and often by the colonial powers.    And that is in fact that we looked at our enemies and instead of believing that they were all one thing as had been advocated for three or four of the first years of the war, we actually looked at them and decided they were many different things.   And that some of these people were only, as it was said economic insurgents, and that they could be split off and used against the other ones.  And that had a devastating effect once it was put into effect against al-Qaeda', 'No, it would work.  That would work very well', 'Yeah, I actually think it wouldIm not in favor of withdrawing from Afghanistan.', 'But what Iwhat Im not in favor of doing is trying to Vermontize large parts of Afghanistan.  I think that doesnt suit', 'I just created that word, yes.  Yeah', 'Yeah, its a cheese thing.  Or a maple syrup thing, one or the other. And, but in fact', 'So', 'I did say it would work', 'it would work', 'No, no, no, no, no, no, no  [APPLAUSE]  No, it dependsdepends on what you mean by succeed.  If you look at, in fact, what President Obama said was his purpose in Afghanistan in March, that was to disrupt and disorganize our enemies, our enemies, not the enemies of the Karzai government, or some other group of political luminaries there, but our enemies in fact.  You can do that in exactly the same way it was done in Iraq because there are lots and lots of available, rentable Afghans out there.  And theyrea lot of them do not belong to the Taliban confederation, some of the ones who do belong to the Taliban Confederation, can be split off, and their', 'I dont really care who controls most of Afghanistan.  What Im interested in doing is disrupting the people who might use Afghanistan as a base for planning offensive operations against the United States.  You have to stop thinking about improving the lot of the average Afghan, and start thinking about protecting these people here, and nothing else in fact', 'Iwell, you may believe that its possible for us over a sustained period of time to spend vast amounts of money, have a couple hundred thousand troops in Afghanistan, and maintain in power a government like Karzais power.  But Im telling you, that whatll happen here is that these folks will make a rational decision in several years if you do that, and theyll tell their members of Congress lets knock this stuff off.', 'No.  WereIm not.', 'Yeah.', 'The British you mean?', 'Yeah, it was a long time.', 'And this is an interesting place too because you', 'They, they did prevail but you have to, you know [UNCLEAR] perfectly well that this was an occasion in which the number of Communist terrorists as they called them, was quite small, they were confined to a particular despised ethnic minority, and the conditions were all there toall you had to do was hold on long enough and keep after them and you were going to get them.   But as I said before, this was a small-scale problem.  Afghanistan is not a small-scale problem in terms of applying a general counterinsurgency strategy to this place because it involves economic development, political reform, and counterguerrilla operations.  And those are all very complex things, and its going to be very expensive over a long period of time.', 'Yeah but this is a democracy, right?  I mean, at least we think it is anyway.  And in fact, whats going to happen here is, if you remember the history of the late, great war in Indochina, 40 years ago, after the application of a great deal of counterinsurgency effort in the last two or three years of the war, and in fact, and the Christmas bombing up at North Vietnam, there was an armistice that lasted for two years, you were there during that period, in fact. And in fact, there wasdid not a thing happen until, the people of the United States over some hiccup in world events then, told their members of Congress that they wanted a law passed to prevent this happening again, and the Congress passed a law that said not under any circumstances would the United States ever assist South Vietnam again.  The other side, understandably understood that as a signal.  Right?  So, a year or so later or six months or whatever it was, they took their eight splendid divisions and they took a provincial capitol, and that was the end, everything fell apart.', 'Now why wouldnt something like that happen again', 'Well, Ive read the whole thing.  [LAUGHS]  The', 'The-- he talks so much about the need for good governance in Afghanistan and about the woeful deficiencies of the present setup which is based really on traditional norms of government in Afghanistan and throughout the region in fact.  You know, then after a while you begin to wonder if he thinks in fact that Karzai is in fact reformable, or will have to be removed and replaced with somebody else.', 'Well', 'You know, I', 'Id like', 'No', 'Yeah.  The, I think theres room, considerable room for agreement here, I mean I agree with Steve Colls idea that the be a good idea to withdraw to the major footprint of the major towns.  And becausebut to try to improve the countryside across Afghanistan is I think a visionary idea, as Ive expressed before.   But within those enclaves which contain a large part of the population, you know, you can do all these things that people want to do that are, are good and worthy projects such as the education of women and the improvement of daily life, all that kinda stuff.   But in fact, you know, someone said earlier that you cant go after the bad people unless youve got good and sufficient human intelligence.   Well, and thatyou wont be able to do that if they think youre not going to pacify the country.  Well I dontIm sorry, I dont believe thats true, you know, I was in the business of running human intelligence for the Defense Department for a long time.   And in fact the way that you recruit spies, isa variety of inducements often based on their peculiar psychology, each and every person, you know.  And its a question of applied psychology in the field. So, the fact that you couldnt acquire people, if you had a number of bases around in Afghanistan you couldnt acquire people that you could use to penetrate enemy formations and then have enough troops on the ground, not the huge force of the troops, but some troops, augmented by the Afghan national army,  and using a lot of these tribal guys, who dont like the radicalism of the Taliban or Wahhabi-inspired, absolute kind of Islam that they dont like, you know, you can go after enough of our enemies to disrupt them and keep them at bay, without having to try to take this whole country over, and to transform it into something thatll be altogether different.  I dontas Ill say againI just think thats too big a task for us.', 'At this time.', 'Yeah.', 'Interservice', 'Again?', 'We all know who he is. MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER I have a question for the cannot and will not side because what youre essentially advocating, is a counterterrorism strategy using long-range strikes to kill terrorist leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Now as you know, Stan McChrystal PATRICK LANG No.', 'Well I think weve moved on beyond that, the question of the day here.  I dont have any quarrel at all really with what Steve said there.  This is really a question of strategy and methodology, rather than ultimate goals with regard to this place I think.   And I would point out to you that I would maintain completely that if in fact we decided to do a countryside wide in the hot parts of Afghanistan, all the Pashtun, across the Pashtun Belt and some other places as well, I think that the costs are going to go up so high in all the various ways that Ive said before, you know, that in a couple years time youre going to decide that there is going to be an endgame, right, because its got tobecause were going to leave.   Thats going to be the problem, and thatll be bad, in a way because, this place will continue to be a breeding ground for Islamic zealots who are in league with other Islamic zealots in other parts of the world and who are dangerous to us.  So that shouldnt happened, I would propose in fact, instead that what we ought to do, is hold the major cities, make sure that, that the Taliban dont have a seat in the UN again, and use these places as bases from which we can affect a strategy of in-depth human penetration of the groups we really dont like, and the use of various dissident parts of the tribal population that can be used for our purposes and they can be used for our purposes, Ithis is not an impossible thing to do.   And have a certain number of troops on the ground that you can use for those kinds of purposes.  Now, that would be a far smaller number of troops probably than we have.  Now, in that kind of strategy it may well be that theres not going to be an endgame, in fact. Because this place is going to be dangerous for a long, long time, people there are not going to change very quickly, although well do everything we can to improve their lives if they  And it may be necessary to maintain a presence in that country for a very long time, in order to ensure that we can carry out the goals of protecting the American people, that we need to focus on.']\n",
      "['Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Looking out at this crowded house Im really happy that Im almost over my swine flu.   [LAUGHTER] Ladies and gentlemen.  So far this evening, youve heard quite a range of opinions.  Lets look at the facts.  [GERMAN PHRASE]   We have been in Afghanistan for eight years.  We have committed enormous amounts of treasure and quite a bit of blood.  And eight years on, the Taliban have no trouble attracting volunteersin fact their numbers are swelling.   They are willing to take up primitive arms, and fight against the most powerful military in history, to stand with a Kalashnikov, or to attack a US outpost and stand and fight, despite the helicopters and the aircraft coming in on them, and killing them.   And we cant get the Afghan army to show up. Eight years.  How much training does it take.   Sophisticated weapons?  What sophisticated weapons do the Taliban have. Bombs, rusty Kalashnikovs and grenade launchers.   The Taliban are willing to give their lives for their cause.  The Afghan army and police are not willing to die for the woefully corrupt and incompetent government of Hamid Karzai.  That is simply a fact. Now my Army colleague John Nagl said, well, the Taliban are hiring, theyre economic soldiers.   Ladies and gentlemen, you do not sign up to stand against the greatest army in history, and give your life, for the Afghan equivalent of a minimum wage.  And we pay better than the Taliban.  Why arent they lining up, to join the Afghan army and fight?  Why do our soldiers and Marines have to go into battle alone?  Or, worse, watching over their shoulder to see if the Afghans with them, are going to betray them or shoot them in the back, as has happened repeatedly.  This matters.  How many Americans should die for the government of Hamid Karzai?  And we canand Steve Coll said, well, you know, were going to fix that. When, how?  Eight years.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the power to stayand the wealthto stay in Afghanistan forever. Certainly beyond our lifetimes, if we wish.  But strategy is about asking what we get out of it.  And is it doable, strategy isnt about whats nice to do, it would be nice to turn Afghanistan into Vermont.  But it is not going to happen.   Because, one thing we cannot do we can fly in in our helicopters, dismount, arrive in an Afghan village and get the elders to nod their heads, until we leave. We can bribe them for a while, they wont stay bribed.  But we cannot make Afghans want what we want.   A brief history.  Weve been in Afghanistan before.  We had major development projects, in Helmand Province, down where theyre fighting now, in the 1950s and 60s.  Nothing came of it.  The Soviets, had at their peak 140,000 troops, tens of thousands civilian advisors.   Their interagency process worked because they could order people from other departments to go.  They have thousands of Dari and Pashtun speakers.  They built hundreds of clinics and schools and factories, its not like just the bad Soviets killing people in the movies.   Their Afghan army was over 300,000 trained with helicopters and tanks.  And they lost.  Because the people of Afghanistan didnt want what the Soviets wanted them to want. Now think of this as an investment.  Were investing our blood and treasure.   What is the possibility of a positive return, for that investment.  For the past 200 years, every foreign investor has lost. Are we truly exceptions to history?  Is it worth the gamble? Afghanistan is not a country, it is an accident of where other peoples borders to ended.   You cannot nation-build where there is no nation to build.  In a tribal society, you work with tribes.  Now we may know that it would be wiser for all the tribes to get along. But we do not want what Afghans want.  General McChrystals report is fascinating.   In many respects its an objective view.  But you know what it leaves out.  Religion is barely mentioned.  In the Counterinsurgency Manual, religion is barely mentioned.  This is even more foolish than trying to deal with the war in Europe in World War IIand ignoring Nazis.   Religion may be politically incorrect to talk about.  Its difficult, it makes us uneasy.  But to write a 66-page report about the Taliban, and not mention the power of religion and fundamentalist Islam, seems to me that we are living in a dream world.  Now.  This debate--  [APPLAUSE] Thank you.  This debate, the terms of it make me uncomfortable. Because Im in the middle.  In a world of very strange bedfellows, I find myself aligning with Vice President Joe Biden, or, Id like to think hes aligning with me.  [LAUGHTER]   But the choices arent all in or all out.  There are rational choices.  Ladies and gentlemen, why did we go to Afghanistan in 2001?  Because of al-Qaeda.  To punish them, to smash them, and to punish those who harbored them.   Afghanistan was a low-budget terrorist motel.  So the feds raid the motel, kill some of the bad guys, capture some, and others escape.  And instead of going after the ones who escaped, we decided to renovate the motel.  [LAUGHTER]  It  [APPLAUSE] Now, I would just close by saying, I believe there is still a purpose in maintaining a compact, lethal force, focused on destroying our enemies, helping Pakistan to the extent Pakistan deserves the help, but not allowing ourselves to be blackmailed by the Pakistanis, as we have allowed ourselves to do.   But at the end of the day, this is about flesh and blood, Afghans of course, and our young men and women in uniform.  Now, I am not a pacifist.  Wars have to be fought.  But let us ensure that they are true wars of necessity, and not wars of inertia, and bad habits.   Letswhen we ask our young men and women in uniform to dieif they must die, let it be for sensible strategy, and attainable goals.', 'Not because, were out of ideas.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Steve, Steve, for Gods sakes, eight years, when is the Afghan army going to show up?', '80how many more years, how many more years tobefore the new Afghan army works', 'John.  John.  Johnthe Afghan police are dying because theyre hiding in their police posts and the Taliban are surrounding them and killing them.  Our soldiers and Marines go out on patrol, and I talk to these guys, they are afraid of the Afghans betraying them, of shooting them in the back.

Johnin that manual, you love to wave around, you did what bad academics do, you took a couple examples that supported your thesis, and ignored 3,000 years of history.  There is nothing in that manual about religious motivation and religious war.  And I will just tell you.  Were having awere pretty comfortable in this auditorium tonight.  Its easy to have this intellectual debate.  But its really to an extent a moot point because the Army and Marines are out of troops.   They are tired.  They are worn.  This isnt an abstract issue.  In order to send 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan on what I believe is a fools errandbased upon history, we would have to send some troops directly from Iraq to Afghanistan.  Now weve been at this for eight years.   Weve had some great successes in targeting al-Qaeda and smashing them.  Wevethat makes sense in terms of our security.  But teaching better dental hygiene to Afghan villagers does not persuade the Arab terrorists in al-Qaeda to stop attacking America, and Americas interests, so John, no, I do not agree that we can succeed in counterinsurgency.  We are not necessarily better than the Brits, who had tried it for over 100 years, or even the Soviets.   I need to see the proof that we can succeed, before send more', 'of our troops, to die for your theory.

Look  [APPLAUSE]  You again, were obsessing on real estate.  This is a Leona Helmsley strategy.  [LAUGHTER]  al-Qaedas not interested in real estate except as a place to duck and cover.  We need to remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place.   Afghanistan, I disagree with Steve Coll, its not a nation, its an accident of where other peoples borders ended, and heres the key thing to take away from this part of it.  First of all, were very successful against al-Qaeda, and no one up here is arguing we have to pull out, its not either/or. WereIm arguing and others are arguing, do you want to get back to focusing on Americas enemies, which is much cheaper, more effective, andjust briefly.  We are repeating the last war in Afghanistan.  The surge, the surge.  What happened in Afghanistan although the surge helped, was that al-Qaeda was a foreign invader.  We were too.  But al-Qaeda was so monstrous, that they alienated millions of Muslims.   And when the Sunni Muslims decided that they wereal-Qaeda was a much more horrible and threatening foreign invader than we were, the game was won.  In Afghanistan, the Taliban are the home team.  Again, say what you want', 'People are dying', 'Well, that doesnt connect.  That just doesnt connect', 'MullahMullahwait one second, Mullah Omar was trying to get rid of bin-Laden for over a year before 9/11, Osama bin-Laden wouldnt go, theres a lotta bad blood.  Dont assume that the Taliban equals al-Qaeda.', 'whoa, whoa, whoa', 'Well he asked the best question of the night, this is the question the Presidents supposed to be asking himself', 'And nobody else', 'Yeah, but', 'No, nobodys articulating the answer', 'Nobody is articulating the answer', 'No, no, thats not what were advocating MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER was in charge of the Joint Special Op  Isnt that what youre advocating, Ralph, when you say RALPH PETERS No. MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER kill them and get out? RALPH PETERS Iwhere did I ever say kill them and get out.  You show me one place.  One of my books, one article, one TV show, when did I say that.  Thats just nonsense.   What I said was whatJoe Bidens saying.  That we need a small, lethal force focused on our enemies. Of course we need boots on the ground MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER Well thats, Ralph, if I could ask my question, thats basically whats known as a counterterrorism strategy RALPH PETERS Yeah MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER thats the alternative to the counterinsurgency strategy that the other side is advocating.  My question is, as you know, Stan McChrystal was our top counterterrorist, he was the head of the Joint Special Operations Command, from 2003 to 2008.  He was the guy who was out there in charge of the forces that were capturing Saddam Hussein, killing Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.   He knows more about our Special Operations capability than anybody else live.  But he has conclude that all our counterterrorist capabilities are not capable of keeping us safe in Afghanistan and Pakistan and that we need to do  [APPLAUSE] RALPH PETERS That, that is not MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER a counterterrorism strategy.  So my question for you, Ralph RALPH PETERS That MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER and the others', 'Yeah, what is the question MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER My question is, why do you have more confidence in our counterterrorist capabilities than our top counterterrorist general. RALPH PETERS Well, for two reasons.  [APPLAUSE]  First of all because, youre mixing apples and oranges MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER Do I get to answer this? RALPH PETERS General McChrystal was given a mission, by the President.  And the mission was pacify Afghanistan.  He succeeded wonderfully, in the counterterrorism.  But he has failed miserably and we will continue to fail, in the pacification effort.   Now, nobodyI hate this stuff where people twist what you say.  I said that we need a compact, lethal force, you need boots on the ground for intelligence, you need Special Forces, you need enough conventional forces for raising security.   You probably need 15 or 25,000 guys.  You dont need 120,000 guys, and so, again, letsplease, lets be fair to each other and listen to what the other persons say, and not try to score points.   The other answer is this.  I get calls from the military around the world.  Theres a myth out there that the military supports General McChrystals strategy.  The calls I get are running about 50 to 1 against sending more troops.   Only call or message Ive gotten supporting General McChrystals strategy, came from Kabul, and one of General McChrystals subordinates.', 'When generals are out of ideas, they ask for more troops.  It is stunning to me how little weve talked about our troops tonight. This isnt abstract, they have to do it.  Our troops are worn down, the equipments worn down.  But yet they will do anything we ask them to do.   If the President asks them to stay in Afghanistan in increased numbers by God theyll do it.  But we should ask them to do sensible things.  Sensible things.  Missions that could be achieved.  So let me leave you, the audience, with a few questions. If the Karzai government is worthy, why dont Afghans support it. Why did they have to steal an election.  If Afghans want us to stay, why are our casualties climbing dramatically.  If as you heard Afghans are fighting, why must we send more troops.   If international support is so dramatic, why must we send 40,000 more troops.  If we cannot articulate the mission, and the end state, how dare we send more young men and women in uniform, because we wont force ourselves to answer the fundamental question, of what why are we there, and what, concretely, do we expect to achieve.  So I will leave you, with a question General Petraeus asked several years ago about Iraq.  Tell me how this ends. [APPLAUSE]']\n",

      "['Jagdish Bhagwati:', 'Douglas Irwin:', 'Susan Schwab:']\n",
      "['[APPLAUSE]  Thank you very much.  Let me just begin first by emphasizing a point which Doug Irwin made, but in relation to a story.  When I was a student at Oxford one of my professors actually told me that hed gone to Whitehall to advise and he was surprised to find that while he thought economics oversimplified things, that in fact, people in Whitehall were working with even more simplistic models.  They usually thought X led to Y and they stopped there.  Y leading to Z, Z leading in turn to X.  All of that was completely beyond them. They were extremely oversimplifying.  The problem, I think, with Mr. Gerard is, I think, as Doug was pointing out, and with the opposing side basically, is that you think that Buy America will create jobs in the steel using sectors, for example, or in the steel industry. First, in fact, X affects Y.  But what does that do to the rest of the system?  Because you are then opening up a whole series of additional effects which are actually going to overwhelm the initial primary impact.  And thats essentially what we need to focus on.   What are these additional effects?  One, of course, is that downstream industries typically become more uncompetitive.  We know when President Bush put on the steel tariffs in 92 the effect was, in fact, to price out a whole lot of steel using industries, including autos, which indeed, there was a famous study which shows that about two hundred thousand jobs may have been lost while we gained a few basically through protecting steel.  So thats point number one.  The second point is that you get out of this, and still, even if we didnt have this problem we would have the problem of retaliation.  And I would say its not tit for tat retaliation necessarily.  Its also monkey see, monkey do kind of imitation. While we do something others do the same thing. If you look at the 1930s it was exactly spreading and diffusion of all kinds of trade barriers, starting out from the Smoot- Hawley, et cetera.  And this, I think, led to essentially what we in economics call a nuclear winter, basically.  There was a chaotic outbreak of all kinds of trade barriers.  That came home to roost in turn, on our export performance, on everybodys export performance.  And I think this is something we need to remember, that as we go into this, policies like Buy America, that is what we are going to get into.  We already see that, as Doug was pointing out, in a variety of fields.  And Im sure Susan will pick up that theme.  The large numbers of actual actions which we already see by way of diffusion of these kinds of tariffs. And we are actually the biggest traders in the world.  Every state has export industries.  Ive been looking at that.  You have basically, therefore, a lot of your jobs at stake.  And those are going to outweigh the few jobs you may save through Buy America provisions.  I think this is, if you look at Buy America, if you know a little bit of history --  I know just a little bit and Doug knows much more --  but Buy America, when did it first get passed in this country?  It has to be in this country, obviously, if it was Buy America.  [LAUGHTER]   It was 1933, right after the Depression, the great [UNCLEAR].  And thats what set the stage.  And I think we are now re-enacting that after this current crisis.  So beware, is all I say.  Caveat emptor, if you want, feel inclined to be working for the other side.  Then I think we also got the argument, to look at the negative arguments produced by Mr. Gerard in his interesting comment, he said, Well, manufacturers are important and we need to support them.  And hes not the first one to have said that. There has been an anti-de-industrialization movement in England, about twenty years ago.  There was also a Berkeley movement called Manufacturing Matters.  And I think Mr. Gerard is really harking back to it.  And this is a case where you assert that manufacturing is some sort of massive externalities.  And I would simply say, Ill just quote my old teacher, Professor Solow, who is Nobel Laureate and the father figure on the Democratic side.  Im a Democrat.  He said, I know there are lots of industries in massive externalities.  But theres a four dollar worth of marginal, social marginal product and the private margin product is one, one dollar.  And he said, My problem is I dont know which ones they are.  And the problem is, and compounded by the fact that the lobbies know where the externalities are.  And I think this is the problem. Its not that we dont believe that there are externalities, but for Mr. Gerard to assume that they are necessarily in steel or in manufacturers more generally has never been proven.  And I dont think any Democrat would support that view.  In fact, what we do is essentially to argue that we must support broader policies like R&D support and so on, but not go into specific activities cause thats exactly the wrong way to go and it gets captured by, by several people.   And I think this is what we need to worry about.  Finally, I would just touch on one thing which drives, I think, the union movement.  And I can understand their fear because I can easily produce models being a theorist also, aside from an activist on these issues. One can easily produce models where international trade actually affects your workers, that in fact the fear is, on the part of unions, that trade with the poor countries produces paupers in the rich countries. Now, a lot of work has been done on this.  Actually, theres very little evidence of this.  In fact, there are studies, including my own with Bob Lawrence at Harvard, which show actually that the pressure on our wages, which is a real problem and, you know, as a Democrat Im entirely sympathetic to the problem.  That has been brought about by extremely acute labor saving technical change, by the fact that the unionization has also gone down for reasons which dont have much to do with globalization or trade.  Given that, I think a lot of us have argued with empirical evidence that trade with poor countries, trade with emerging countries has actually kept the consumption cost of workers wages down.  So it, in fact, it has moderated the --', 'So I will pick up the argument later.  [LAUGHTER]  [APPLAUSE]', 'Well  [CLEARS THROAT]  Theres nothing which prevents you from applying safety standards and we are doing that all the time.  So the fact that some Chinese imports or any other imports, including our exports, get caught in the safety net doesnt mean that Buy American is good.  I mean thats simply a non-sequitur.', 'No, this is a', 'Um', 'Theres somebody talking, I?', 'Maybe hes answering the question', 'I couldnt quite get at what exactly the, he was driving at. [LAUGHTER]   But let me just get back very quickly to Jeff Madricks question  [LAUGHTER, BRIEF APPLAUSE]  about free trade agreements, I totally disagree with what Susan said, I dont know whether its kosher to disagree.  [LAUGHTER]  But, I mean, the preferential trade agreements are between us as a major power, with little guys in different parts of the world, relatively except for South Korea.  And if you look at any', 'free trade agreement', 'its about that big, it consists of all kinds of atrocities being perpetrated on the smaller countries.   And I think it pretends to be a trade agreement but is actually a tradea non-trade agreement and I think, we need to get away from these altogether, and get back to the multilateral trading system.', 'I would be [UNCLEAR]', 'I', 'It is', 'But we pay a lot of subsidies too', 'at usually the state and local level.  They are up to huge amounts, people like Mayor Bloomberg even announced with great glee that we managed to attract industry to New York, and all the governors compete for it also.  So I think actually, we dont have clean hands either, so you know, for us to say, others are subsidizing and we are not', 'doesnt make any sense', 'Can I get back to the question?', 'Let me just say that, Im myself an immigrant, okay?  I dont think Ive done much harm to this country.  I think Mr. Gerard, a greatyou know, description that you were a Canadian', 'That you were a Canadian and I  Maybe youve done harm to this country but I  [LAUGHTER]  I think you should defend it yourself.  But I do think, that this country as Susan, you know, eloquently pointed out has done enormously well, as a result of immigration.  And I think', 'to indulge in, you know', 'hiring aliens last, firing them first, the sort of movements which are going on, are extremely un-American and also extremely inefficient.  We have really prospered on the  [APPLAUSE]  I mean', '[INAUDIBLE]', 'Well', 'Um', 'Yeah', 'Yeah, but let', 'let me just explain one thing in contradiction of that', '[LAUGHS]  Well, Im glad you say that', 'Uh  [LAUGHTER]  I hope youre able to persuade others about   [LAUGHTER]  in this audience when Intel, Bill Gates, et cetera, go out and get people from say India, the vast majority of those people are fantastically able, theyre trained at the best institutions', 'in the country.  So we are going out and looking for enormous talent.', 'But, I am', 'a professor as you know, and in every class there is a tail of about 30 percent, who really should never have been admitted but somehow managed to get in.  [LAUGHTER]', 'Everywhere.  Ive taught at MIT, Ive taught [LAUGHS] at Columbia', 'everywhere its the same, but, I would just say one thing. Which is that there are people, who could be employed but who are kind of at the bottom end, theyre not really comparable to the kinds of people we are going out and getting.  And so I think the nation prospers by having those people come in, create jobs, because its not a given number of jobs that we are talking about. And I think the other people will find their own way, in jobs which are more appropriate to their qualifications', 'Let me first focus on Buy American provisions because thats really what the motion is about.  And there I would just simply say that while immediately you see that youre saving some jobs, youre losing many more because of the downstream effects, retaliation effects, diffusion or protectionism effects.  By the time youve added it up, youre losing far more than youre gaining. And I think its just being penny wise and pound foolish.  And thats the fundamental point we need to understand. The second point relates to the more general issue of protectionism which has come up from the other side.  I think certainly, Mr. Gerard, and I think to some extent, the other people on the other side, have been focusing on the fear that trade has actually putting downward pressure on the wages of our workers.  As a Democrat, Im certainly concerned about it and I think most people are concerned about it.  I mean, these are the bottom thirty percent of our society and we ought to worry about them.  The only question is whether protectionism is the answer.  And I think what is going on basically is that massive technological change is going on, and I think we need to worry about that and how to adapt to that.  And if we dont do that were not going to get an, appropriate answer to the problem. You take acute technological change going on assembly lines. Entire assembly lines are wiped out.  If youre going to see, you know, take your child to see Charlie Chaplins Modern Times and they say that he goes berserk on the assembly line and they say, Can you take me to see an assembly line?  Well, you can but you wont see Charlie Chaplin there.  You will see five people in a cage up there.  So what has happened is that large numbers of jobs have been lost and youre getting more volatility as a result, for the unskilled workers.  And we have to really rethink the whole issue of how we accommodate the institutional change to be able to support workers, but protectionism is not the answer.']\n",
      "['Well, I apologize if my voice is a little bit gravely but I used up most of it yesterday when I achieved a childhood dream of seeing the Green Bay Packers play at Lambeau Field.  And I learned, aside from the fact that Green Bay can lose a game theyre supposed to win, I learned that you can get very funny faces on peoples faces when, very funny looks on peoples faces when you amble up to them in Green Bay and say, So what do you think of them Buy American provisions? [LAUGHTER]  It doesnt, it doesnt work so well.  Its a real conversation stopper.  What Id like to do is remind you of the proposition before you tonight and that is whether Buy American provisions will backfire.  In fact, theyve already backfired so you have little choice but to vote for the affirmative.  First of all, what is Buy American?  Buy American is a provision in federal legislation that mandates the purchase of U.S. made products in government contracts.  Now, in some sense, who could be against Buy American?  I want people to buy American products.  I want a strong and healthy and vibrant American economy.  I want good jobs and good wages for American workers.  I think we can all agree on those propositions.  But thats not the issue.  The debate here tonight is about the means to that laudable end.  Buy America may sound like its a good idea, but the more you think about it, its actually counterproductive. Let me give you a specific example of what Buy America is.  In the economic stimulus bill that we talked about earlier, that John Donvan mentioned --  it was passed by Congress earlier this year --  one section requires the use of American made steel in all stimulus related construction projects unless it costs more than twenty-five percent above foreign suppliers. Now, this is a good deal for the American steel industry but its a bad deal for the rest of us.  By raising the cost of construction projects our nation can afford fewer of those projects.  That means fewer jobs will be created with the limited amount of money we have to spend.  If we have to pay a twenty-five percent premium for steel that leaves less money for all the other projects.  In fact, this is not a trivial matter. Picture in your mind for a moment the Bay Bridge in San Francisco.  Theres a lot of steel in that bridge.  California had to repair the bridge a few years ago and the Buy America provisions were enforced.  The domestic steel bid came in at, guess what?, twenty-three percent above the foreign bid.  Now, why it wasnt twenty-four percent above, I dont know.  But that added four hundred million dollars to the cost to repair the bridge.  Thats almost half a billion dollars for one project. Now, what can you do with half a billion dollars?  Instead of paying inflated prices for steel you could repair roads, build new bridges, build new schools, invest in green technology, provide health care for children or even perhaps reduce the fiscal deficit that is literally bankrupt... bankrupting the state of California.   Thats more than just paying more and getting less.  The real problem is this:  Buy America is a bad jobs creation program.  Steel is very capital intensive so when we increase production we dont hire a lot of new workers. There are about a hundred and fifty thousand steel workers in the United States.  There are seven million construction workers.  There are 1.5 million unemployed construction workers.  Construction is really labor intensive.  So if we spend more taxpayer money on steel we can afford fewer construction projects that will employ more construction workers who really need the jobs.  So why do we give U.S. steel producers a twenty-five percent handicap against foreign suppliers and other bidders?  Well, they were the only industry that was powerful enough to get it into law.  Its corporate welfare, pure and simple. What percent of the steel sold in the United States is made in the United States?  Seventy percent.  They control seventy percent of the market and they want more and they want the taxpayer to pay for it.  Buy America has already backfired because it creates bureaucratic red tape that has forced state and local governments to delay starting infrastructure projects and therefore, delay getting people back to work.  In Perkins, Oklahoma theyre planning on building a new waste water plant for fifteen million dollars.  It was shovel ready.  The government came in to give them another 1.5 million in free stimulus money.  But it wasnt free.  It came with Buy America and other pieces of red tape and it raised the cost of the project even more than the town would be getting from the federal government.  So now the town has to go out and borrow more money to get the project going.  And this is not an isolated example.  Heres a news article from last weeks Wall St. Journal how Buy America can hurt U.S. firms, and it talks about how, various ways in which U.S. firms cannot bid on municipal projects here in the United States because they may make components that are sent for final processing in Canada. They come back from Canada, and its called a Canadian product even though a lot of the value added is made here in the United States.  And that just doesnt make sense.  Many think that Buy America is aimed at China.  Well, we aimed at China but we hit Canada and now were shooting ourselves in the foot.   Canadian governments are boycotting U.S. firms in their infrastructure projects and costing us jobs here in the United States.  So in sum, Buy America is not a good idea.  It raises the cost of --  It sounds like a good idea but its not a good idea.  It raises the cost of infrastructure projects.  It pads the bottom line of the steel industry.  It reduces the number of construction workers we can employ with our precious tax dollars and when other countries employ their own buy local provisions our exporters will be cut out of their lucrative market, those lucrative markets abroad and will lose even more manufacturing jobs here in the United States. Im sure youve heard of the saying, Whats good for GM is good for America.  Well, we know thats not true.  And whats good for the steel industry, its workers and its executives is not good for America, either, necessarily.  So Buy America is costly corporate welfare.  Its already backfired.  Please vote affirmative.  Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]   JOHN DONVAN Thank you, Douglas Irwin.  And now to argue against the motion that Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire, Leo Gerard, who is the son of a miner from Canada. And now that he is International President of the United Steel Workers, when he steps up to that microphone he has eight hundred, fifty thousand union members standing behind him. Leo Gerard.', 'Well I wouldnt Grant the premise that it worked for Mexico, in fact, what did that lead to.  Huge debt crisis in 1982, huge collapse of the growing middle class, huge economic problems which is one reason why they chose to embrace economic openness after the early 1980s.   But actually, Jeff Madrick raised an important point too.  Theres been tremendous economic growth in India.  Tremendous economic growth in China.  The biggest change in the globe has been happening in those regions, where theres hundreds of millions of people moving into the middle class.  Theyre able to do that because of trade openness.  And yes', 'Oh, so China', 'The issue', 'Well, I wasnt finished either.', 'You know, I', 'Thats great', 'Im actually one of the few trade economists who believes the trade deficit has become a problem.  So the question is how do you deal with it.  Buy American will not deal with it, its not the right approach.   Why do we have a huge trade deficit with China. What do we do with our dollars in the United States.  70 percent of US GDP is consumption.  70 percent.  What is the share of consumption in China.  30 percent.   They are a high-savings country, we are a low-savings country.  We are a high- consumption country, theyre a low-consumption country.  That is the ultimate source MALE PANELIST [INAUDIBLE]', 'of the trade deficit', '[01:13:46:12] Its not unfair trade practices, its not all this other stuff', 'We have to save more as a country, and China has to', 'consume more.', 'Actually there is.  Its that', 'Theyre right, there isnt', 'free trade in the world, because Colombia has very high tariffs against our goods, and we allow them duty-free access to our market.  So its very much unfair and the Colombia FTA wouldve evened that playleveled that playing field.', 'Well, first of all, just in terms of the proposition before the house, I think they have backfired.  I think thats demonstrable.  I think you have no choice but to vote affirmative.  But let me make some major concessions to the other side.  I think what youre hearing is things weve heard in the 1980s.  Weve actually even heard them in the 1950s and beforehand --  and that is that economic change is very hard and very painful and we should do something to address that.   I happen to think that the remedies theyre suggesting are wrong, will backfire and actually dont really address the underlying problem.  Weve talked about the declining share of workers in manufacturing.  Manufacturing is a victim of its own success.  A century ago a third of the work force in the United States was in agriculture.  Now its about two percent.  Why?  Because the productivity of the American farmers is absolutely astronomical.  The same thing has happened with American factories.  Theyre churning out stuff and we just need fewer workers.  Theyre much more capital intensive as productivity.  Think about Manchester, New Hampshire.  Im from New Hampshire.  If youve ever been to visit Manchester -- lovely city, huge brick building, over a mile long, former textile mill.  Not a single shoe, not a single textile made there anymore. Its a thriving city. It wasnt always thriving and it went through some very difficult times.  But it made that change.  It had to.  The jobs actually were stolen by the south, not by a foreign country.  And then they left for the south for other countries. Jeff Madrick said, You know, Im tired of hearing about people saying trade doesnt, you dont lose jobs.  Actually, Ill give you a copy of my book, because in one of the chapters I say, First thing, trade destroys jobs. Trade also creates jobs.  But theres no denying that trade destroys jobs and certainly in poor, competing industries.  But it creates jobs elsewhere.  The question is the balance.  Guess what?  Technology destroys jobs.  Whats happened to all the bank tellers?  [APPLAUSE]  Whats happened to all the secretaries?  Do we stop technology?  No, we have to adjust to it and become a better society for it.  I do believe the trade deficit is a problem.  But its not mercantilism of China or what have you. China is very poor but their savings rate...What was the personal savings rate in the United States?', '[OVERLAP]  Zero.', '[OVERLAP]  But they can save in China.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Thank you, and thank you very much for inviting us here today to debate this very timely and very interesting and very complicated topic.  Im going to start by talking about Hire American policies, which is part of this debate although no ones talked about it yet and Im going to make quick work of that, because quite frankly Hire American restrictions are un- American.   They are discriminatory, they reek of discrimination, they deny us the very diversity that has made the United States, as competitive as we are.  Immigrants built this nation and all you need to do is look at some of the companies that were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants the employ millions of Americans, including Google, Intel, eBay, Yahoo, Proctor and Gamble, duPont and even US Steel.  Buy American? Buy American sounds like motherhood and apple pie, and, unfortunately, Buy American policies hurt America, and hurt Americans.  And we have history to point to and we have, the fact that the United States has to export to grow, to point to, and the fact that the risk of retaliation is very, very real indeed, lets start with history.   Rick mentioned Smoot-Hawley, well, guess what. In the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act we raised our tariffs, it was perfectly legal under the international trading system at the time. It ultimately prolonged and deepened the Great Depression.   No country, no country has ever reached or sustained a level of prosperity with economic isolationism as their policy, with trade protectionism as their policy, with buy national policies.  In fact if you look at the 1990s the countries that grew the fast in the 1990s, were countries that opened their markets, followed our lead by the way, opening our markets.  They grew three times faster than the countries that did not open their markets.  95 percent of the worlds population, meaning the worlds consumers, live outside of our borders.  Those are our customers and if anyone thinks that we Americans have enough money to buy our way to recovery, and to future competitiveness without exports, youve got another thing coming.   Half of GDP growth, more than half of global GDP growth going forward over the next five years, will come in the advanced developing countries.  The bulk of global economic growth will come outside the United States.   And if youre talking about stimulus packages and quite frankly, Rick, this debate is about Buy American policies, meaning the government telling us, that it will not buy foreign goods whether they are higher quality, whether they are better priced.  $3.5 trillion will be spent in the next several years, by other countries on stimulus.  Globally.  We need a piece of that. And if you are a Caterpillar worker in Illinois, if you work for G.E., if you work for any of the major manufacturers in the United States that sell to these countries, you want a part of that action.   China is going to be spending the vast majority of the $550 billion its putting into stimulus, on infrastructure.  That is business for American exporters.  India is going to be spending anywhere from $20-$70 billion in roads construction.   Now. This issue, this canard, ofthat we dont manufacture anything, is utterly absurd.  Some of you may be surprised to know that the United States remains the single biggest manufacturer in the world, bar none.   $1.7 trillion in manufacturing outputs, China is a distant second, at $1.3 trillion, with Japan and Germany following up to the rear.  One in six manufacturing jobs depends on exports, 6 million US jobs depend on manufactured good exports.   And if you look at US economic growth you discover, that our manufacturing is in fact 20 percent of our GDP, not 9 percent.  And it continues to grow, our manufacturing output. Yes, our manufacturing employment, because of productivity enhancements, technology, has not kept pace.   But if you look for example at a company like UPS that tells us for every 40 new packages that are shipped overseas, they hire a new American worker.  Those are high-paying blue-collar jobs, Fed Ex, exactly the same kind of statistics.  And in many cases youre talking about, these are Teamsters who are going to be hired. Retaliation, retaliation is not some myth, retaliation is very, very real, not only did we see it afterSmoot-Hawley, we saw it after the Buy American language, it is not coincidence, that within six weeks of the Buy American legislature on the stimulus package moving through the United States Congress, it is not coincidence that the Chinese suddenly decided to let their provinces favor local companies, because before that a lot of Americans were starting to make a lot of money in those markets.  We need access to those markets, and we need to be exporting to stay competitive.  The folks who are telling us, this isnt going to happen, they are ignoring the fact that the Canadians have already retaliated, the Chinese have already retaliated.   The US Chamber of Commerce estimates that for every 1 percent of this global stimulus bonanza that is out there, that we lose because of retaliation, we lose 175,000 jobs.   That eclipses the, what, eight, 9,000 jobs that the Petersen Institute has told us could possibly be created in the steel industry in the United States, and Doug has already talked about how that has hurt other workers in construction and so on.   So let me closeas follows.  One, remind you, there is zero evidence that buy national policies create more jobs than they sacrifice, and in fact the data is very, very compelling the other way, trade isolationism kills jobs, it does not create jobs.   Buy American sounds good.  And the issues that are being raised by the other side in many ways are legitimate issues.  But Buy American policies and trade isolationism will not solve any one of the problems that they are describing.  Buy American sounds good, good sound bite, bad policy, hurts America, hurts American jobs, thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Excuse me, Leo.', 'The issue beingIm sorry', 'Leo', 'Le', 'Leo, and Im, and I would note, Doug never got a chance to finish what he was saying', 'I got that.  No, I mean the point is, we can get off on this long tangent about Chinese trade policies, first of all, that is not the issue at hand.  The resolution talks about Buy American policies, Hire American policies, will backfire.   They will backfire, they have backfired, thats what were voting about.  But in terms of China, I have taken on Chinese trade practices, and weve got legislation to do that.  We took six cases against the Chinese in the Bush administration, we won or settled every one of those cases, got rid of illegal Chinese subsidies,  we managed to get the markets where they were artificially closing them.', 'There areIm sorry.  There are statutes for anti-dumping, theres statutes for countervailing duties, there are lots and lots of statutes.  Buy American legislation does not resolve any', 'single one of', 'the issues, excuse me', 'but the other sides been talking back', 'Well, let us note again, youre going to come back and remind everyone what this debate is actually supposed to be about, Buy American, Hire American.  But, the other side is meandering, I want to go in that direction and talk about trade agreements because what Rick has been saying about trade agreements, just isnt borne out by the facts.   If you look at the free trade agreements, and, forgive me, Jagdish, I know you hate free trade agreements.  If you look at the agreements that weve negotiated, you find that US exports to our trade agreement partners have gone up 40 percent faster, than our', '40 percent', 'fasterfake exports?  Go talk to G.E. and Caterpillar', 'and, UPS', 'Let me finish a thought', 'Let melet me finish the thought', 'You can, you had', 'Letlet me just, let me just finish', 'I can say it because it is a fact and in fact if you just look at the trade agreements that we negotiated during the Bush administration US exports have gone up 80 percent faster to those countries than the rest of the world.  NAFTA.  NAFTA was raised, thisI know this debates not about NAFTA, but  And I didnt negotiate NAFTA, NAFTA went through during the Clinton administration.  But you know what?  If you look at the statistics in the 10 years before NAFTA and the 10 years after, you discover, that the 10 years after NAFTA passed, US unemployment was lower, US employment was higher, US economic growth was higher after NAFTA.  So all of this, these scare tactics MALE PANELIST Ohhh. SUSAN SCHWAB um, excuse me, do not', 'reflect reality', 'Today we have a', 'manufactured', 'National Association of Manufacturers has shown us', 'that US trade balance with our FTA partners, is now in surplus', 'in manufactured goods.', 'If you look', 'Im sorry, let me just', '[PAUSE]  Do I answer that now', 'The Colombia-US free trade agreement was, uh, signed over two years ago, three close to three years ago now.   It would benefit both countries, the independent International Trade Commission has told us that US exports would go up to Colombia, Colombias exports would go up to the United States.   In fact, because Colombia has preferential access to the US market now, US exports would go up to Colombia even faster than Colombias exports to the United States, but Colombia would derive new foreign direct investment.   We made all of these arguments on Capitol Hill.  The Democratic leadership reached an agreement with the Democratic leadership in 2007 to add special labor and environmental protections to that agreement, after it had been signed and was very grateful that the government of Colombia was willing to incorporate that in the agreement.   And lo and behold, the Democratic leadership in the Congress decided they just didnt want to move the legislation.  And a legislative process that has worked for the United States since 1974, was turned on its head, when the Speaker of the House refused to allow a vote on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement when we knew the votes were there, in the House and in the Senate to pass it.', 'John, can I', 'Itwell, this', 'Thewell, I mean the,  [LAUGHTER]', 'I can answer that question now, sorry, now that Ive thought about itin terms of Buy American, here were talking about Buy American this, Buy American that.  Our trading partners, Canada, Europe, are negotiating free trade agreements with Colombia, so that they can have preferential access and lock our guys out, thats whats happening', 'No, no, thats not what I said', 'Thats not what I said', 'He also doesnt  [OVERLAP]', 'Australia?', 'Singapore', 'I think we have a', 'It we apparently have a', 'Can I', 'But the other side has sort of been bobbing and weaving about the topic on the debate.  So Im forced to address just a couple of issues here on the ethics of open trade.  The fact that there have been six hundred million people brought out of poverty in China and India, in part because they have opened their markets over the last two decades, I think is a very strong positive note, how important trade can be and theyre potential new customers of ours.  We remain the single largest manufacturer in the world. We want to be selling those turbines, those earth movers, that transportation equipment, the aircraft.  Its very, very important. And we care as much about U.S. jobs as the other side.  However, not a single solitary one of the arguments that they have made would create a single job.  And in fact, if you look at the proposition here, the proposition here would destroy --  Buy American/Hire American policies we have been able to show, without question --  would destroy more jobs than it would create.  It sounds patriotic.  In fact, Buy American/Hire American policies hurt America, hurt Americans.  There is zero evidence of any country ever using economic isolationism and buy national policies to achieve and sustain economic development.  Someone mentioned Japan.  I remember twenty years ago, thirty years ago these same folks were telling us the Japanese were going to wipe out all our manufacturing.  We are still, by far, the largest manufacturer in the world.   We are the largest exporter in the world.  There are millions of U.S. jobs that depend on these exports and that includes exports that we can and should and will be making to foreign countries that have stimulus packages. Clearly, the vote has to be on which side has convinced you that the policies will create more jobs and more opportunities for Americans.  Clearly, that is a vote in the alternative because Buy American policies have and have already failed.']\n",

      "['Well, dont hold it against me.  [LAUGHTER]  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]  Thank you very much.  Its great to be here tonight. Dan and I are here with the task of convincing you why diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere.  And I think its important as we begin thinking about this issue to stop for a moment and ask yourselves, What is our current diplomacy with Iran?  Whats the current state of affairs?  The current state of affairs is that the Obama Administration has privately and publicly offered direct, unconditional talks to the Iranian regime.  The Iranian regime has failed to respond.  So as of now, there is no diplomacy with Iran. There are no talks. Even if there were talks tonight, Dan and I want to describe for you why it is that those talks, in fact, are going nowhere, and its for three reasons.  There are really three elements that should be present in any set of diplomacy to have any chance for that diplomacy to succeed in preventing the Iranians from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  First, the current set of diplomacy of diplomatic outrage by the Obama Administration includes no threat, no credible threat of military force should the diplomacy fail. Secondly, there is no time line in place that would prevent the talks from dragging on and on and prevent the Iranians from using the talks as an excuse to continue to develop their nuclear program. And third, none of the very crippling economic sanctions that might actually convince the Iranians that the cost of attaining a weapon is too high are in place. Now, let me just be clear.  Dan and I are not arguing that force is necessary.  Were not arguing that military force is unavoidable and were not arguing that diplomacy itself is doomed to fail.  Were simply arguing that the current course were on is, in fact, a course to nowhere.  Now, as you think tonight about your vote with respect to this resolution, one of the really important things to consider, which the Obama Administration has not been considering, is the history of American efforts to reach out to the Iranians.   And I wanted to just run through for you tonight a few of the high points of that history, because any realistic effort to use diplomacy National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski met in Algiers with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Prime Minister and Defense Minister. And according to a note taker who was present in the meeting, Brzezinski told the Iranians, quote:  We will accept your revolution, we will recognize your country, well recognize your government, well sell you all the weapons that we contracted to sell the Shah. Three days later the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized.  Two weeks later the Iranian officials Brzezinski met with had lost their jobs.  In 1980 Warren Christopher negotiated the Algiers Accord with the Iranian regime.   The Iranians agreed to take no further hostile actions against the United States.  Three months later they seized the American, seized new American hostages in Lebanon. One year later they attacked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and three years later they killed two hundred and forty-one Marines in their barracks in Beirut.  Throughout the 1990s the Europeans threatened to impose sanctions if the Iranians didnt alter their behavior.  The Iranians did not alter their behavior and the Europeans did not impose sanctions. In 1996 Iran was responsible for bombing Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, killing nineteen American soldiers.  Despite this attack in the late 1990s Washington decided it was time to try again, to extend yet another hand to the Iranians to build a new relationship. We lifted parts of our sanctions program allowing food and humanitarian efforts, or humanitarian supplies, into Iran.  And the President and the Secretary of State gave speeches essentially apologizing to the Iranians for past American behavior.  In response, the Iranian Supreme Leader said these apologies were, quote:  Too little too late and did no one any good since the Americans continue to commit such crimes.  Now, you can read a much fuller account of this part of the diplomatic history in Ken Pollacks terrific book, which I really do commend to you, called The Persian Puzzle.  Youre welcome. But to, [LAUGHTER]  to be fair, though, its not just Ken who has been involved in failed attempts to reach out to the Iranians.  Nick and I have also have our fair share of that, as well, when we both worked in the Bush State Department.  2004, the European Union III completed the Paris Agreement with the Iranians in which they Ahmadinejad was elected.   They announced they were continuing their enrichment activities and the Russians prevented us from attaining any real sanctions against the Iranians at the United Nations.  In 2006 we took the step of offering for the first time in thirty years direct negotiations if the Iranians would give up their enrichment program and our European allies committed to imposing tough sanctions if they didnt. The Iranians didnt give up the enrichment program and, of course, our allies wouldnt allow us to impose tough sanctions.  In 2007 the National Intelligence Estimate, parts of which were declassified, showed there is one thing, actually, that the Iranians did respond to.  Although the Iranians did continue to enrich uranium they did halt other parts of their nuclear weapons program in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.  In 2008, despite the fact that the Iranians had failed to meet any condition we had set for direct talks and despite the fact that they were funneling weapons and terrorists into Iraq to kill Americans, we sent our Undersecretary of State, Bill Burns, to meet with the Europeans and Iranian representatives.  Once again the Iranians learned that no red line is really a red line.  To sum up this history let me quote from the man who was actually the note-taker at that first meeting in Algiers in 1979.  Hes our current Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates.  Describing this meeting recently, Secretary Gates said, quote:  Every administration since then has reached out to the Iranians in one way or another and all have failed. Some have gotten into deep trouble associated with their failures, but the reality is the Iranian leadership has been consistently unyielding over a very long period of time in response to repeated overtures from the United States.   In closing let me just say that the history of our attempts to reach out to Iran offer us lessons about the three things that might actually work in terms of inducing Iranian effort, in terms of stopping Iranian efforts to attain a nuclear weapon.  Weve gotta have a credible threat of the use of force if diplomacy fails.  There have to be crippling economic sanctions that impose a significant cost on Iranian attempts to attain a weapon and weve gotta have a timeline so that the diplomacy doesnt drag on forever.  None of those things characterize our current nuke diplomacy with the Iranians.  And therefore, diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well I think first of all, Nick is mischaracterizing Dans and my view on this, Dan and I are not arguing that we should abandon diplomacy or that we should not undertake diplomacy.  Dan and I are simply arguing that the current diplomacy is going nowhere, and its going nowhere because its flawed diplomacy.   Now, discussing this issue with Nick, you know, I feel a little bit like Alice in Wonderland here, because Nick and I sat in many of the same meetings over the course of a number of years, and, saying that we didnt have diplomacy because we didnt have sustained discussions completely ignores the fact that it was the Iranians who made that choice in many, many instances. And I went through in the beginning of the talk the extent to which the United States government has over 30 years attempted again and again and again, including our National Security Advisor sitting with the Iranian Prime Minister and saying, we will sell you weapons, we will recognize your country, well recognize your revolution.   And the Iranians walk away from the table time and time again.  Now I think this gets to a very fundamental point that Dan made which is, what is Iran, what is the nature of that regime. And part of the problem with the current diplomacy, the reason why I believeone of the reasons I believe its going nowhere is because theres a fundamental misunderstanding, about the nature of the regime. You know, President Obama makesgives a Norouz message to the Iranian people but also to the regime and he talks about things like common hopes, and common dreams.  I dont believe that we have any common hopes or dreams with the supreme leader in Iran.   I dont, I think the supreme leader in Iran believes in exporting terrorism, he believes in exporting his Islamic revolution, and I think that, you know, at the end of the day, youve gotta ask yourself, you know, as Kissinger was asked, is Iran a country, or are they a cause, if Iran is a cause, if they are a hegemonic, revolutionary, terrorist, extremist power, and theyre attempting to gain a nuclear weapon, then we are being dangerously nave and irresponsible to pretend that we have now history here of trying to talk to them', 'I just wanna make one quick point which is that our opponents need to decide what their position is.  Their position is either, diplomacy hasnt started, which is what they both argued when they made their opening presentation, it hasnt started, its gonna start this summer, give it some time.  Or their position is, well, diplomacy has sort of started with some baby steps.  Or their position has gotta be, you know, look, its started and the Iranians have responded well, you know, they gotta choose one of those. But I would say that, that at the end of the day what weve seen actually is the administration has attempted to reach out a hand, the Iranians have not responded and theres a report this afternoon, uh, out of the Jerusalem Post that the Iranians are actually basing missiles now along the Straits of Hormuz.', 'Yeah, I just wannayou knowactually its not fair to say the rest of the world wants us to talk to Iran.  I think that youve actually got a situation now, you saw it during the election, where you had the British for example act, you know, demonstrate extreme nervousness with the notion that suddenly the United States was offering direct, unconditional talks, which is basically leaving our European allies aside.  Our European allies have been with us in the European Union III, weve been working on a multilateral course for diplomacy, direct talks cuts them out of the picture.  We havent even talked about our Arab allies, and the notion that the Arab nations today want us to talk to Iran, you know, is a fallacy. What were hearing from government after government after government, is that they are very nervous, they believe the United States is about to make deals with Iran, and so they are now thinking do we need to make our own deals?   You know, their concern is so great that weve sent our Secretary of Defense out to calm em down, so the idea that the rest of the world wants us to talk to Iran, fundamentally mischaracterizes the danger of this new openness and this unconditional', '[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]', '[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC] make a point there because that is an important point, and actually we did that.  We had them as Nick when we offered tough sanctions.  When we offered direct negotiations, the deal was, that the allies would agree ahead of time that they would support tough sanctions on the Iranians if the Iranians did not agree to suspend enrichment.   The Iranians did not agree to suspend enrichment, we got Security Council resolutions which the Russians in particular, as Nick knows because he spent hours and hours dealing with the Russians, managed to take every single tooth out of. Now weve, since the Obama administration has been in office, had the Russian foreign minister in Washington, and hes announced that in fact he doesnt believe its time for tougher sanctions against the Iranians.   But, I think its very important for people in the audience, first of all to look at the wording of the resolution, the question is not all of the questions that Nick and Ken are trying to get you to focus on, its not should we go to war, its not, should we do diplomacy or not diplomacy, the question is, is our current policy going anywhere.   Thats the question, and I find it really fundamentally irresponsible, for Nick and Ken to act like, lets just give diplomacy a chance cause we havent done it before. [APPLAUSE]', '[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  this policy was actually sold internally, because people were told that we had commitments that there would be sanctions if the Iranians in fact did not suspend enrichment, now maybe yourenow maybe youre, its semantics about specific sanctions.', 'But the idea was, theIm telling you what I know.  [LAUGHTER] What I know is that we had a commitment from those allies that we would go to sanctions, that they would support tough sanctions, if in fact the Iranians refused to suspend.  The Iranians refused to suspend, and we got no tough sanctions.', 'You negotiated', 'for weak sanctions.', 'I totally agree with you', 'I agree with you.', 'Yeah, I mean I think its, you know, terrific to sort of sit here and say here is the ideal set of circumstances, we gotta have these tough sanctions and, Liz and Dan, how are you gonna get those tough sanctions, you know, without doing diplomacy.  And I would say the history of the relationship shows, we arent gonna get tough sanctions with diplomacy, the current diplomacy that weve got, at the end of the day, what Dan isthe argument Dans making is absolutely right that, the Ira  There are not inducements at this point, there are not inducements that make the Iranians better off than having the bomb.  What does cause the Iranians to alter their behavior and what we have seen historically is if they believe that there is a credible threat of military force if they dont alter their behavior.  This is also true of our European allies.  And as youre talking about this diplomacy I think we need to think about the motives of all of the people, all the partners involved here.  You know, the Europeans, as weve seen throughout, they like their commercial relationships with Iran, and they dont like the notion that the United States is gonna use military force against Iran.   If they believe the threat of military force is on the table, thats frankly the only thing Ive seen that convinces them they better get serious about sanctions.  We have not seen them serious about sanctions, and I think the idea that were gonna call this current diplomacy strong or tough diplomacy, it simply doesnt bear out if you look at the facts.   This is diplomacy with no teeth, this is, you know, an open hand, direct and unconditional.  And', 'Neither Dan nor I are trying to strangle these efforts, in fact we are very hopeful that these efforts will succeed, I think everybody on this panel wants diplomacy to succeed in stopping Iranians nuclear weapons program.   But I think that you have got to be realistic about what it will take to have that success.  And when I hear Nick talk about 15 or 16 moves down the table and the first round is gonna fail, people need to look at how the Iranians in the past have described these discussions with us.  In August of 2005, the chief Iranian nuclear negotiator gave an interview on Iranian television in which he explained in great detail and with great pride, that he was using the negotiations in order to gain the time that they needed to get the nuclear program up and running.   He admitted it, he was open about it.  The notion that, weve got 15 or 16 moves and weve got all kinds of time, I mean, Id like to hear Nick explain how he can feel comfortable that weve got the time to undertake the kind of slow and cautious, toothless diplomacy, that were currently engaged in.  [APPLAUSE]', 'No, I said [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'No.  What Im suggest', 'Were notwait, I just need', 'To say diplomacy has not begun ignores the 30 years of history. And the point that I was making about the Iranian nuclear negotiator was, the Iranians used negotiations to stall, they used negotiations to buy time.  So, Nick, are you saying you dont believe that theyll use negotiations to buy time if were at the table?', 'Thats not the current', 'thats not the current diplomacy', 'Well, I think the reason that you start in 1979 is because its the same government, its the government that took over after the revolution in 1979, and the people that were dealing with today are the heirs of the people that we were dealing with in 1979.   Now, there has been in many instances and we talked about it, you know, sort of this elusive attempt to find reformers, and I think a lot of what Ken did for example, during the Clinton administration was, attempt to reach out to those reformers.  You know, people talk about whos up and whos down, but at the end of the day I think what youve got is clearly a situation where, the government were dealing with today, in terms of its ideology, its objectives, its desires and its approach to the rest of the world and its approach to us, are in fact, you know,  theytheyre the Islamic government of Iran, theyre the inheritors of those that we were dealing with in 79, which is why, I began in 79, I mean you could go back thousands of years presumably as well.', 'Right', 'Thats right, all four of us are arguing for the motion', 'How much time do you give the Iranians.  How much time would you give the Iranians.  So weve gotta have this tough-minded diplomacy that you promise is coming, although I have to say the resolution says its going nowhere now, just to remind people in the audience.  But how much time.  I mean I understand what youre saying  [LAUGHTER]', 'It says is going nowhere, its present tense.  But at any rate, um [LAUGHTER]  But its, its a serious question', 'Its ano you cant actually', 'Its a serious question', 'I would give it very little time.', 'And I would say  [LAUGHTER]  I would give it basically enough time that we could actually sort of test out, the extent to which were serious about using force, I mean I, you know, my own view is the window is closing pretty fast here.   I would say, you know, were very close to the point where, the Iranians themselves may in fact be near the point where any action that we take is insufficient to prevent them from actually gaining the value and the benefit of having at least the threat of a nuclear program', 'You know, Id say Im', 'Im closer', 'No, no, but its not just time, ittime as you heard me say at the beginning, time is key.  Now I my patience has, as you know, been tested and I think probably is closer to the breaking point than Nicks is.   And I think thats a responsible position.  Because I think to take the position that you guys are taking which is, yes, its definitely going somewhere, although it hasnt really started yet, and once it starts, its gonna take us a long time because, you know, to do this professionally', 'Youve said all of those things', 'All right, but Nick said', 'What makes you think', 'But what makes you think MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER If a game-changer is required, and it seems to be, would Russia support effective sanctions if we rethought our position on missiles in eastern Europe, and are there similar quid pro quos we could offer the Chinese for them to support effective sanctions, and would that not change the whole situation.', '[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  situation, we have to remember this, were in a situation where we have offered, not just to talk.  You know, we offered to remove our objection to their WTO accession, we gave em spare parts, we lifted pieces of our sanctions.   You know, weve offered a whole range of things to them.  And so for us to now be in a position where were going again to the Iranians and you know, to say to them, okay, well that didnt work but how about if we do this for you, how about if we do this for you   Each time, the Iranians refuse to take the steps that the international community has said they should take.  Nick and Ken seem to think we oughta go back to them again and say okay, well that wasnt enough for you, what about this.  And I just think thats a dangerous situation to be in when they are getting closer every day to having a nuclear weapon. [APPLAUSE]', 'But it is a key point, ityou know, if in response to the Iranian intransigence, we decide that we are no longer gonna support the missile defense system, that in fact has helped to protect and will help to protect some of our most important allies in the world against the eventuality, the potential of an Iranian nuclear weapon, that to me is a concession to the Iranians.  Now maybe, you know, its a concession were making to the Russians, [APPLAUSE] but its a concession to the Iranians.', 'I think we actually, probably all four agree that successful diplomacy cannot be bilateral.  Now, I dontI probably shouldnt speak for my opponents here but successful diplomacy has got to include countries like Russia and China who actually have relationships with Iran that they could use, theyve got leverage with Iran that they could use were they to choose to use it.   I think the difference between us, there are two differences between us, one is, I would say, you know, all right, lets accept for the sake of argument that we can work with Russia and China to try to put tough sanctions in place against the Iranians.   Theres no evidence right now that theres any intent on the part of either Russia or China, to put tough sanctions in place against the Iranians, that piece of this diplomacy is going nowhere.  And, I think the second difference is, you know, this question of how much hope do you hold out, after years and years and years, and, you know, Lavrov said to us,  you know, within the last six weeks, I dont wanna have tougher sanctions on the Iranians, I mean we ran into this problem consistently.  At the end of the day, the only thing that will get the Russians and the Chinese and some of the other, some of the Europeans onboard with this is if they believe, if they dont sign up for crippling sanctions the United States will use force.  And right now they dont believe that.', 'I would venture a guess that Im somewhere to the right of many people in the audience tonight with one or two notable exceptions. [LAUGHTER]  But you dont have to be as hawkish as I am on this issue to realize that our current diplomatic track with Iran is in fact going nowhere.   You really only have to agree with the testimony that Nick gave before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week.  In his testimony Nick very helpfully laid out steps that the Obama administration must take in order for diplomacy to go somewhere. He said, force must be on the table, President Obama needs to prevail upon Iran to freeze its nuclear research as the talks proceed so Iran does not steam ahead unimpeded.  President Obama should set a timetable, and finally Nick said, excuse me, that itll be crucial that the President agree on the automaticity of sanctions with the P-5 countries, especially Russia and China in advance of the talks.   Now I think we probably disagree on whether these steps alone are tough enough to convince the Iranians to give up their weapons.  But it is indisputable, that any of these steps are part of our current diplomacy.   Therefore, as we debate the issue tonight and as you cast you vote, I would say dont be swayed by Nicks division of, you know, vote for them and youre voting for war and vote for us and youre voting for peace.   What were arguing is that the current diplomacy is ineffective, is going nowhere, because, by Nicks own definition, it does not include the steps that it needs to include to make diplomacy effective.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you, John.  And its good to be on this panel with Liz and Ken and Nick, who probably all agree on more things than we disagree.  But certainly on this issue there is disagreement.  Its also always good to be considering debating a potential conflict  heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf --  while in the heart of the Upper East Side.  Liz and I are really advantaged in this and its live on BBC, no less.  I just want to pick up on something Nick said, that it is hard to say that diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere if it hasnt really begun.  I would say hes right, the second part of that  that it really hasnt begun.  But its not for lack of trying.  I think its important to evaluate not only the history that Liz went through, in terms of the decades of efforts to negotiate and deal with Iran, but also actually look at just the last few months and the signals that this administration has sent to Iran, even before this administration took power.  In 2007 and 2008, while this country was consumed with this fresh face on the scene  Senator Barack Obama  so was the world.  There was deep, intense election night coverage in the United States but also on Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya and the Arab satellite channels and the different news broadcasts throughout the Middle East. They actually covered primary, they have their own primary election night specials in the region  the best political team in Abu Dhabi coverage, or whatever you want to call it.  And they were consumed with this.  They were consumed with it for a number of reasons, not the least of which is so much of Barack Obamas message was a clear rejection of U.S. foreign policy under George Bush.  In fact, in the Democratic primary, one of his sharpest criticisms against Senator Hillary Clinton at the time was that she was basically a closet hawk, that she would represent somewhat of a continuation of Bush foreign policy.  And the issue he specifically drew contrast with her on that was Iran, because she had supported some tough sanctions that related to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. And, and Obama called this a continuation of Bush policy on Iran. There is going to be change.  And the American people overwhelmingly voted for this new face, this change, this rejection, if you will, which was a centerpiece of now President Obamas campaign  overwhelming voted and sent a message to the world that there would be a new policy. Barack Obamas inaugural address with President Bush sitting a few steps away, he issued some pretty sharp, very public criticisms while the world was watching of the former administrations foreign policy over the previous eight years. He then in his first hundred days made good on his commitment on Iraq, which is basically to move along some sort of timeline for withdrawal, which was a big issue for the Iranian government.  He has in recent weeks been very assertive about his plans for pursuing aggressively a two-state solution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  another important issue to the Iranian leadership.  He traveled to Europe and gave a series of speeches in which, again, he almost apologized for U.S. foreign policy over the previous eight years and made clear that things were going to change.  And then finally and most importantly, he was issued an unconditional invitation to sit down with the Iranian government, in defiance, I might add, of three Security Council resolutions that call on the Iranian government to halt its nuclear program. President Obama is putting himself out there.  He is really exposing himself by making such a clear and bold initiative for diplomacy. The only problem is, despite all this, against all this backdrop, the Iranian government still has not returned the call.   So it is true that diplomacy has not begun.  But it is not for a lack of trying.  As Dennis Ross, who is currently advising President Obama on Iran policy today, has said in a report that was issued by the Bipartisan Policy Center late last year, If we have to chase the Iranians to the table then any hope of diplomacy is off the table.  We can, there can only be a truly viable diplomatic track if we can get to the table quickly, both sides agree that there is a real diplomatic process.  At the moment we are chasing the Iranians to the table.  We are off to an unwinnable start.  So I would just simply say that it is true that diplomacy has not begun but it is not for a lack of trying, which raises questions about where it is actually going.  And finally, I would just pose the following question to Ken and to Nick:  If you argue that it hasnt gotten off the ground but it will get off the ground, the question is, What is your timeline? I commend a report to all of you that came out today issued by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Iran.  Chairman John Kerry of the Senate Committee hired an investigative journalist and hired a number of other journalists and former Intel officials who actually traveled around the region to really get their own independent assessment of how far Iran is from having a nuclear weapon.   And the report was issued this afternoon.  You can get it on the Foreign Relations Committee website.  Its very clear.  The time for inaction is narrowing.  So if we say diplomacy hasnt begun and we gotta let the beginning, the path to the commencement take place, and then well consider how long the actual diplomatic process will take, is a tough sell, given the timeline that many are projecting, including as of today the most recent, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Finally I would say the question that needs to be considered is, What is the nature of the regime we are dealing with in Iran?  If we believe that there is a possibility of diplomacy being successful, if that is our objective to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon on this path, what is the nature of the regime?  Is it aone possibility is that it is a radical theocracy  in which case Im not convinced they can be persuaded against a nuclear weapon.  And if they are driven by some sense of martyrdom and some sense of inevitable outcome that is worth sacrificing their country Im not convinced that they can be persuaded that they should not have a nuclear bomb.  Perhaps theyre rational and a nuclear bomb would bring them national power, it would deter U.S. threats in the future, it would cement potentially their hegemony throughout the region. And if theyre rational and thats what this is about, I believe there are no inducements we can offer them.  There are none that, no carrots that would be better than all that they would gain from having a nuclear bomb.  So if we are going to pursue some sort of diplomatic path it must have a real timeline that is narrow and it must be backed up by a very credible threat of military force and a very credible threat of crippling sanctions and a real clearly defined publicly available trigger point for those actions to take place. Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Can I just ask a questionor gogo ahead.', '[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  [APPLAUSE]  Nick, if the Americans have taken away the excuse, how long before the Iranians reciprocate, I mean, how long, you said six months, are you giving six months for them to agree to come to the table, or are you giving them six months, once they agree to come to the table, that then they have six months to figure out whether or not we can get a deal.', 'Cause it takes two parties to participate in a diplomatic process and right now theres only one party participating in it.  So we can call and call and call all we want, [APPLAUSE]  but theyre not participating, and I know were asking everyone here to vote on this motion, as Liz alluded to earlier, the Arab world which is closest to this, is already voting.  How they think diplomacy is going, how they think the current strategy is going, I just wanna read you an editorial from the Jordan Times.  It says Arab capitols have all the right to be worried about a new adventurous US policy in this part of the world that may again not succeed as planned.   Washington surely cannot dramatically shift its policy vis--vis the countries in the Gulf.  The new administration lorisks losing its barely- regained credibility in the region, if it does not consult its friends about its new standpoints in the area, new friends should not come at the expense of old ones.   This was not written at the height of the unilateralism of the Bush administration, this was published in the Jordan Times today.  The Arab world is deeply concerned, that the message the administration is sending is its gonna cut some sort of grand bargain potentially with the adminiwith Iran at best, and at worst, leave an open-ended process which is this, were calling and calling and begging them to come to the table and theyre never responding, and oh by the way the clock runs, and a nuclear bomb appears at the end of the day.  So, debating, you know, giving diplomacy a chance, not giving it a chance, were perfectly prepared to give it a chance but just listen to those closest to it in the region.  They dont believe that theres any reciprocity on the other side.', 'I would just argue that, it is true, the economy is in desperate shape, 25, 30 percent inflation right now, 25, 30 percent unemployment, oil trading today about 60 dollars a barrel.  They are in a much weaker, you know, less than half than what it was a year ago, they are in a much weaker economic situation.   But if itwhat Ken is stating, that the Iranian government, which is complicated and opaque and difficult for all the reasons Nick said for us to truly understand, but if you believe that the Iranian government, is effectively going to make a rational decision and they can be won over with inducements which is what hes saying, what package of inducements could we ever offer them, ever, that would be better than the situation they would get from having a nuclear bomb.  I mean think about this, a nuclear bomb would be able to guarantee that the US would never threaten them again, we would   If Iran tomorrow decided that they wanted to go into Bahrain which they consider one of the original Iranian-Persian provinces, if they wanted to go, slowly take over Saudi oil fields, which would certainly help their economic situation, we would have virtually no leverage, we would pose no threat to them and as theyd try to further establish their own hegemony as I said earlier, in the region, having a nuclear bomb would allow them to cement that.  What inducements do we have to offer them, that would be better than all that a nuclear bomb would give them.', 'I think trying to  This is a classic fallback position, trying to compare the Iranian regime to other governments, and other situations', 'Yeah, but potentiallyand theres also potentially an internal divide and fissures within the regime thats divided between those who are motivated by national interests and those that are radical theocrats, as President Obama has described them,  that arent terribly rational, and trying to figure out and game them out and hope that we can win over and resolve those fissures in the short period of time before they actually have a nuclear bomb, to me, is a pretty big gamble.', 'I will give my time', 'to my partner here', 'I, you know  [LAUGHTER]', 'Can I just', 'Yeah, I would just like to clarify one point cause theres clearlyand', 'Its connected', 'Its connected', 'Yeah', 'Nick and Ken keep setting up this false choice.  Either diplomacy, or military action.  And what Liz and I are arguing, is we are all for diplomacy.  We are for diplomacy that actually results in a diplomatic process beginning.  The process has not begun.   We areand we believe that that diplomatic process will only get going, if it is backed up by credible threat of military action, we are not arguing for military action.  But we arewe do believe that the Obama administration has to persuade our allies', 'But, ', 'but hold on  [LAUGHTER]  But, can I', 'Exactly, President Obama  President Obamas strategy does not involve that, so if Nick and Ken wanna come to our side and acknowledge that that is the problem.  President Obama has not made clear that military action is serious and credible', 'I dont know if the Obama administrations gonna be inviting the Cheney-Senor team into  [LAUGHTER]  to prescribe their policy on Iran, but hey, you know, stranger things have happened', 'You know?  Change is coming to America.', 'Sorry.', '[INAUDIBLE, OFF-MIC]  I dont disagree, I hope President Obama comes forth with that, he hasnt done so yet, my only point is if you are going to have a credible useif youre gonna have a credible threat of force, you have to articulate a timeline, a trigger point, and a credible threat of force.  President Obama has done all the things that you have, have hoped he would do, except that last piece, so I dont know why anybody in the Iranian regime, or among our allies, would take that threat that youre positing as serious when the President himself has not taken it', 'I would just, Id put Prime Minister Netanyahu in the same category that I put all of the regional players, or at least many of them. Which they are deeply concerned about the mixed signals were getting from this administration.  Prime Minister Netanyahus saying what hes saying because he is concerned that the administration is not backing up their diplomatic plan with a credible military threat to solve this problem if it doesnt go anywhere.   That is the same thing that is going on throughout the Persian Gulf and the Arab world, and I take your point, your earlier point, Ken, that its very difficult to sort of read exactly what is going on in each one of these Arab societies, but, just the fact that Secretary Gates as Liz said earlier had to travel to Cairo and Riyadh to reassure them, dont worry, were not gonna make this open- ended,  and the fact that Dennis Ross has had to bounce around all these capitols to say, dont misread what were tryyou know, were trying to talk but its not gonna  I mean, it gets to a point here where these people are voting, whether its Netanyahu or the king of Jordan or the king of Saudi Arabia, or, or the president of Egypt, there is deep concern in the region, and this is a profoundly violent and volatile neighborhood were talking about, where wars often start because of misunderstandings and miscommunications and mixed signals, and violent revolutions.   And we are dealing with a region right now, which I believe because of the current administrations lack of clarity about how they intend to back up this diplomatic process, if the Iranians actually ever enter into it, is potential for a very dangerous situation.', '20 seconds', 'okay, Ill be real quick, but I do wanna commend Ken for taking on his own party from time to time which hes done on some pretty big issues so I', 'SecondI know.  [LAUGHTER]  With my with the balance of my 16, I will say, if you believe there is a discussion going on right now within the Iranian government between confrontationalists,   those who believe that we just need to plowor the Iranians need to plow ahead and build their nuclear bomb and be quite confrontational, and those that are reformers that believe that, we can cut a deal, the Iranians can cut a deal with the westwe clearly wanna strengthen their hand.  And what better way to strengthen their hand than when theyre going into those discussions with the hard- liners than to say, if we dont act now, while employment is 25 to 30 percent, while our economys falling apart, 70 percent of the population is under 30 years old, we could have a revolt here   If the Americans move forward with truly crippling economic sanctions, or potentially military force, this regime will collapse and we will have a total mess on our hands.  That is the kind of leverage we wanna give the reformers in their internal debates with the hard-liners.   To say the Americans are lealeft this thing open- ended, theyre having a discussion, we havent even returned their phone calls, this is great, the hard-liners arent gonna be terribly persuaded that they should, they should be responsive.', 'I would just close with a couple of quick points.  One is a quote that Ill read that characterized the Iranian leadership in March of 2007.  President Achmadinejad is reckless, hes irresponsible, and hes inattentive to the daily needs of the Iranian people.   That was not Liz Cheney, that was not Dan Senor, that was then-Senator Obama, in a speech in Chicago, on March 2nd of 2007.  That characterization is probably accurate, and is probably consistent with the history that Liz laid out in her opening. We dont know exactly what will push the buttons of the Iranian people, none of us truly know what will push the buttons of the Iranian regime.  It is such an opaque society, I went through this with Iraq when there were many experts on all sides of the ideological spectrum who had very strong views about how the Shiites would respond to this and the Sunnis would respond to this and the Kurds would  And, you know, some of them, all of them were sometimes all of them were wrong and sometimes all of them were right, and as Nick said earlier, when youre dealing with a society, for three decades weve had no communication, no interactions, it is very hard to know whats going on inside.  So all we have to base this debate on is the history that were aware of, which Liz went through in her opening statement.  The actual public statements of the leadership of the country which should count for something, and the rhetoric they have used with regard to Israel and the United States and the west is apocalyptic. And thirdly, their capabilities.  The capability that they are trying to develop, right now, in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, and in defiance of our effort to reach out to them.  That is a dangerous, toxic combination.  Their history of non-negotiation and stalling, combined with the public statements about what they would do, the genocidal rhetoric they, they articulate, that, they say they would use genocidal weapons for, and finally, the capability that they are trying to pursue.  So', 'A dip', 'A diplomatic process is fine, as long as we are clear and we can make clear to the Iranians, where it ends, and how strongly we back up the alternative course in our negotiations.

      "['It is not.', 'Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Thanks.  Some words hide the truth. Just as torture is named, enhanced interrogation, and the logging of old-growth forests is called the Healthy Forest Initiative, so also prostitution is named a choice, a job, work, a victimless crime, and on Craigslist its called a wide range of personal meeting and relationship opportunities.  [LAUGHTER] These pimp-messaged slogans are good for business but theres not much truth to them.  Whats wrong with prostitution is the renting out of a womans mouth, vagina, or anus, and what it does to her, psychologically. Whats wrong with prostitution, and whats wrong with buying sex, are the same things that are wrong with other forms of violence against women, incest, rape, and battery.  Ive been researching prostitution for 15 years, weve interviewed 900 women, men, and transgendered people in prostitution, in nine countries on five continents.   And over the course of that time weve also interviewed 500 johns.  Prostitution is not a choice because the precise conditions that make a choice are absent. For example, equality with buyers, and physical safety, and real alternatives.   If you imagine a pyramid, remember that only about the top 5 percent of all women in prostitution are at the top of that pyramid.  These are people that are privileged by race and class.  The other 95 percent dont have those kinds of privilege or alternatives for escape.   Let me give you some examples of the sex inequality, the race-ethnic inequality, and the economic inequality in prostitution that are often invisible.  A woman in Lusaka, who knew that five blow jobs would get her a sack of mealy meal to feed her kids.  Thats not a choice. A woman in India who worked in an office where she concluded that she might as well be paid for the sexual harassment that was expected of her anyway, in her job.  Thats not a choice.  The teen in California who said that in her neighborhood, boys grew up to be dealers and pimps and girls to be hos.  She was the third generation of prostituted women in her family.   And prostitution more severely harms people who are indigenous or ethnically marginalized because of their lack of alternatives. Thats not a choice.  Or the young woman sold by her parents in a brothel in Nevada. She took six different psychiatric drugs to make it through the day, selling sex, thats not a choice, or Ashley Dupre, who was bought by Governor Spitzer.  Dupre ran away from what she called an abusive home at 17, shed been homeless, she had a drug problem, a convicted New York pimp bragged that he turned her out.   And at 17 pornography was made of her by a man who had a prostitution conviction.  The Emperors Club, where Spitzer bought her, was run by pimps who charged a lot because they said it was high-class call girls.  But it was the same as any other pimps, they took their 50 percent off the top.  Like a majority of johns, Spitzer most likely enticed, coerced or persuaded her with money to put her life on the line by not using a condom.   Thats not a freely made choice.  Women in prostitution face a statistical likelihood of weekly rape.  A Canadian woman in prostitution said, whats rape for others is normal for us.  A woman at a legal brothel in Nevada said, its like you sign a contract to be raped. And in Chicago, the same frequency of rape was reported by women in both escort and street prostitution. Women in prostitution are seen as body parts or fake girlfriends and their feelings dont matter, and theyre not seen as human which is perhaps why theyre murdered at a higher rate than any other group of women ever studied.   The emotional consequences of prostitution are the same in widely varying cultures.  Whether its high-class or low-class.  Whether its legal or illegal, whether its in a brothel, strip club, massage parlor, or the street.  Symptoms of emotional distress in all forms of prostitution, are off the charts.  Depression, suicidality, post- traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, dissociation  Two thirds of the women we interviewed, and all of the people we interviewed in prostitution, two thirds of them had PTSD at the same level of the most emotionally traumatized groups ever studied by psychologists.  That would be combat vets, women who had just been raped, women seeking shelter from batterers, and also state-sponsored torture survivors. Whats wrong with sex is what johns themselves tell us about it. For example, if you look at it, its paid rape.  She has to do what you want.  I use them like I might use any other amenity, a restaurant, or a public convenience.  Its like renting an organ for ten minutes.  In research interviews with johns, we found that their abuse of women extended to women who had not been prostituted yet.  The johns that bought the most women in prostitution were the most likely to commit sexually coercive acts with non-prostituting women.   When women are turned into objects that men masturbate into, it causes immense psychological harm to the person acting as a receptacle.  Please dont be fooled by people who tell buying sex is just another job. Its wrong to set aside a special class of women, those who are the most vulnerable among us, for mens sexual use.  Whats wrong with paying for sex is its the business of sexual exploitation.  Thanks. [APPLAUSE]', \"I would like to quote, to respond to what Sydney said, and quote from her book, which is, she said, A call girl is simply a woman who hates poverty more than she hates sin.  I would use the word prostitution and not sin, so I would say a call girl is simply a woman who hates poverty more than she hates prostitution.  I think thats the whole point were making here, that shouldn't be the choice.  If were seeking an end to inequality between men and women, if were seeking an end to violence against men and women, women should not have to make the choice between poverty and education, paying the next months rent, and prostitution. [APPLAUSE]\", \"I would like to address this trafficked toddlers issue, which is basically ranking victims.  When you decide that a battered woman is not really harmed because her arm wasnt broken, or a slave isn't harmed as much if they're in the house as opposed to in the fields, or a woman in prostitution is not harmed as much if shes a little older.  And Id like to tell you that a friend of mine who works in the field of child prostitution recently told me that theres now a move to only rank genuine victims of prostitution of children if they're pre- pubescent.  So the age is always going down, were always carving out some group that its okay to use in prostitution.  I think when we make these false distinctions, were agreeing to set aside a class of human beings, the ones that make more, they're a little older, a little this, a little that.  Were setting aside some people whos suffering we agree to ignore.\", 'Its not what we heard from women in prostitution that this is their main concern, is physical, even physical injuries.  The main concern is to get out and to figure out how to get out.  And the thing that causes them the most suffering is the psychological damage thats extremely long lasting.  The bruises and the--they even heal from the rapes.  So this is what Ive heard.  I think when someone, let me, cac I say one other thing', 'about disability?  I think prejudice against someone who has a physical or emotional disability is wrong.  The cure to that prejudice is not selling someone to that person so they can have sex.  The cure is to address the disability-ism, and the looks-ism in our culture.', \"I actually have read the New Zealand report, and I also have studied prostitution in New Zealand, and one of the things that happened in New Zealand is what a Maori community activist called an apartheid system of prostitution.  In New Zealand, the Maori people are prostituted much younger and much longer, and they're more frequently homeless, so we again have that situation in New Zealand of a special class of people who are more vulnerable\", 'Well, lets talk about the regulation.  What happens in real life in New Zealand, to stick with that for a moment, is that zoning is the sine qua non of regulation of prostitution.', 'The people who have a lot of money dont want it in their backyards, so its zoned into the neighborhoods of poorer people, thereby increasing trafficking, johns, solicitations, and their general vulnerability to all aspects of the sex industry.  This happened in New Zealand, so', 'Sorry.', \"I, what  Heres the answer to that [APPLAUSE]  Its counter- intuitive.  Its been tried, and it didn't work.  The Mayor of Amsterdam said, and I think this is true of many people, we thought it would work to regulate.  Well-intentioned people thought it would work to regulate, and it didn't.  It actually, its very counter-intuitive.  He said, what, they're shutting down over a third of the legal brothels in Amsterdam right now.  Why? Because eighty percent of the women in Dutch legal prostitution are moved there from economically stricken Europe, and because theres organized crime thats out of control.  Legalization is a pimp magnet, so I mean, thats the answer.  If we know that it doesn't work, its been tried, but\", 'I dont think what', 'Were talking', 'about the evidence of harm here, not a moral or emotional reaction.   And the evidence of harm, I think the other side has just conceded the debate, if its wrong to prostitute someone who was a child when they entered prostitution, then what we know, and theres no argument about these numbers, is that in the vicinity of 75 to 85 or 90 percent of everyone in prostitution, entered prostitution as a legal minor, oftentimes, a 13- or 14- year-old.  Thats a fact.  [APPLAUSE]', 'One of the things', 'One of the things', 'One of the things', 'I think its wrong to pay for sex, theres no mutuality of sexual pleasure or any other kind of power in prostitution, where one person has the social, legal, and economic power to buy another person, and to use them as a sexualized puppet.   By the way one of the kinds of damages we havent talked about today, is the damage to womens sexuality after being in prostitution for a long time.  They usually are not capable of any kind of sexual intimacy, that reflects the years of selling that act in prostitution. They say, thats stolen from them.  Men who are sold in prostitution experience exactly the same kinds of damage to their sexuality, and the similar symptoms of traumatic stress.  Maybe the primates we should take a lesson from, are the bonobos, who, when female bonobos are co-dominant, males are less aggressive and females are more sexual.  Theres a lot of sexuality in bonobo society, everyones having sex.  But its used for mutual pleasure, its used to cement social bonds.  And by the way the first time a maleadolescent male gets sexually aggressive, the female elder bonobos get together and kick his ass.  He  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  He learns from that one experience that thats not what sex is.   So, one other comment about legalization of prostitution, it really is a failed experiment, the same numbers of women in legal prostitution in Nevada want to escape it, the same numbers are homeless, as in other kinds of prostitution.   The institution of prostitution is built on the exploitation and abuse of women, it cant be fixed, only abolished.  Im relentlessly optimistic about mens capacity for change.  Its wrong to buy sex.

      "['We won seven hundred and forty-five million dollars in the southern district of New York before a jury like you. [APPLAUSE]', \"What I know about prostitution I know from the prostituted women that I work for, representing them because they asked me to.  We have found the sanctimoniousness and the superiority of the moral position against prostituted people, that is that they are bad, to be insulting and insufferable.  And we have also found the rescue impulse to be demeaning and typically ineffective. But, no one opposes the normal business of prostitution for money, that is of sex for money, more, or more eloquently than the women who really know what it is because they're living it. That is the women who are living in this industry, most of whom are trafficked by international definition, because they are being pimped.  And they want to get out, and they can't.  Thus fitting the international definition of slavery.  When you want to get out of marriage theres a term called divorce.  Eighty-five percent of women, when asked what they most want, that is women in prostitution, say what they want is to get out, but they dont know how to.  Usually they got in as children.  Normally they got in as children.  The majority.  They were, most of them, sexually abused, actually, even before that.  This is in the ninety percent plus range. That is, they were treated as a thing for sex before they ever had a chance to become a person first.  And usually they are women, meaning their economic options are limited already by sex discrimination, precluding a vast majority of what men do for better pay, leaving, for the women who end up in prostitution the one remaining thing to be called her choice.  This is a myth that one woman described for herself as, to be able to get out I had to believe I chose to get in.  Sex, when its right, like friendship, is its own reward, its mutual, its equal in its diversity.  You can't buy the real thing.  In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with.  The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent.  It acts like physical force does in rape.  And as Kathleen Barry put it, the only difference between rape and prostitution is time, one ends, the other doesn't.  And then she is stigmatized and deprived of dignity by society, and criminalized by the legal system.  So for her, whats wrong with it is, its abusive, its intimately violative, its destructive, its damaging, its dangerous, its exploitative, and its unequal.  Its up to you to decide if this is right or wrong. We're not here, actually, to discuss the proposition its wrong to be paid for sex.  We are here to discuss the proposition, it is wrong to pay for sex. Ive just been talking about whats wrong with it for her.  Whats wrong with it for him is, hes using her, hes exploiting her, hes exploiting his inequality to her, which is usually a desperate economic inequality.  In order to have access to her person in a form of bodily invasion, while he gets off on the illusion that he has chosen this freely, when he is taking more than can ever be paid for.   [APPLAUSE]  And what he is buying is not only that chunk of her humanity called self-respect  And it isn't sex only, its you do what I say, sex.  Now, to be against this is why those of us who are today supporting this proposition support the Swedish model.  In this model, the seller is, well, the buyer is strongly criminalized.  The seller has, is also strongly criminalized.  In criminalizing the person who is the one whos buying the sex, you are criminalizing the one that my desperately poor Indian clients, from India, call the real criminal. And you de-criminalize the sold.  You couple this with real education, real employment opportunities, real jobs, real money. Women are entitled to real equality and real choices.  Men presumably also need to pay for household expenses to put themselves through school, and you dont find them, in general, not in anything like the numbers you find women, selling themselves on street corners.  Women need real equality and real choices.  We're asking you to vote yes for the proposition as a way to weigh in on the side of the view that women and children are not for sale.  [APPLAUSE]  And I'm going to reserve the balance of my time for my rebuttal. [APPLAUSE]\", \"I didn't say what you just said.  I said that its always in a context of sex inequality in which your options are precluded, to begin with, and as Melissa pointed out, theres a dramatic amount of racial and class based bias in the people who are actually in this industry.  And you know, prostitution is what women do when all else fails, and all else fails often.  And there are a lot of things that men do, in general, when all else fails, and prostitution is not that thing.  And that means this is an institution of sex inequality.  It is.  And you know, when, but I would also note, that we actually agree with, that is, Miss Barrows and us concur in the view that the sold in this, the women, the girls, when they are boys or men, should not be criminals.  They should be, the prostituted people need to be de-criminalized, firmly.  That is the Swedish model.  And its the buyers who were here to talk about, the johns that Melissa described.  And whether, what it is, what it is they are doing when they are buying people.\", '[OVERLAPPING VOICES]  Like reality, for example?', \"Yeah, Germany is actually thinking about the Swedish model at this point, having discovered that a tremendous amount of trafficking is produced by the draw of legalization.  And thats the same as in the Netherlands, although they're not considering the Swedish model at this point, but are looking to try to address the abuses that happen as a direct result of their legalization, across the board legalized initiatives.  The other thing that happens in countries, for example, or in parts of countries like Australia where you regulate it better, that is in the interest of trying to reduce the violence and the illness and other forms of abuses of the people, women in prostitution, you create a legal industry so you can regulate it well, thats their whole attempt.  What ends up happening, you know, apart from the fact that you can't put anything in the rooms like pillows because they're a lethal weapon, or sheets, because somebody might get tied down by them, so its a pretty bare prostitution experience.  What happens is that the men who want to buy all the things that are abusive and dangerous and destructive to the women, in addition to the psychological, which remains the same, go to the ever-exploding illegal industry around it.  Right?  So you legalize it in the name of having a well regulated prostitution industry, and exploding around it is the illegal industry for which there is no legal structure to address, for all the men who, to begin with, want to have sex without condoms.\", 'Apparently hes a lot smarter than, you know, several hundred years worth of other people who have tried to regulate and who have a million different ideas about how to do it.

As to coalmine work and its negative consequences, what you describe is some peoples human rights are being violated through this work, thatin the way that its being done, in the coalmine industry. They have human rights and they need to be recognized.  What were talking about is people whose human rights are being violated, and they need to be addressed.   Now as it happens, whenever someone else is selling you for sex, you are trafficked, and your human rights are being violated.  The vast majority of people in the sex industry, somebody else is taking the pimps cut off their prostitution.   And theyre doand this is what is being bought when youre buying sex, this is the reality of it, it is an industry of human rights violation.

From the other side weve heard that paying for sex is old.  That its diverse.  That its natural.  Although I dont think there are any pimps among chimps.  That  [LAUGHTER]  that theres a global grandeur to human sexuality.  And, also I think in essence that theres nothing wrong with it if you get paid for it but you arent the one that has to do it.   But we havent heard an argument about why its right.  And little bit about why some aspects of it might not be wrong, entirely.  But nobodys really saying why its right.  And to be on the cash nexus, with sex. When this gets, you know, pushed down to the fine edges of the slippery slope we essentially are having a, you know, if they get their way, what can we still have, department.  And UNESCO, which is a United Nations entity, has this to say about the relation of what weve been talking about, sexual victimization, and the economic exchange, they say, Sexual victimization this is a quote has been found to be the first step in the breakdown of a womans identity, which is necessary, to render the human body into a sexual commodity for economic exchange. Thats I think what it is.  Its not only aboutwhat thats saying is, I think, is that whats right about sex, is what paying for it violates.  The hard issue I think for our side is, what to do when women arent paid for anything else.  Ive recently been working with 13-year-old girls who are the sole support of their families, an inter-generational caste-based prostitution in India.  And they are the ones who are saying, nothow can you take this one and only thing away from us that is the only thing that anyone will buy.   They are the ones who are saying, give us any real option. Thisour economic desperation that has put us in this position, is not all our lives can be.  And, theyre saying, in Mr. Cowens terms, change the difficult situation.   Now, the other thing that is not being addressed by the other side is the question, why arent men being sold for sex.  Like by the millions worldwide in the same ways and in the same proportions women are, it seems me, that if being bought and sold for sex is part of the grandeur of human sexuality that men are really missing out on something here.

      "['The Good Girl Revolution.', 'Yes, that, thats the hardcover  [LAUGHTER]', 'Yes.  [LAUGHS]', 'We changed it cause there was some confusion.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  Thank you.  Ladies and gentleman, thank you so much for joining us tonight to consider this most important topic. Before delving in I still have in my mind a song I heard on the way to the airport on the radio, which went like this.   Im not a saint but Im not a sinner, everythings cool as long as Im getting thinner.  Which, I think, expresses a profound truth, actually. Its a serious question.  In a society in which the self is the body, to some degree, as long as were getting thinner, do we even believe that there is such a thing as a sexual right, and a sexual wrong.   Nobody wants to judge.  Adultery is now a lifestyle choice.  A 22-year-old woman from San Diego, is now auctioning off her virginity to the highest bidder.  Right?  And were not supposed to judge.  And yet I would submit that we do judge, all the time.  When I was living here in Manhattan some 10 years ago, Ill never forget the time when I was innocently buying my Metro pass,  and sipping my coffee, and a man came up from behind me and barked at me and he said, you know, you shouldnt drink those frappaccinos, theyre very fattening.  And I was shocked that a perfect stranger would presume to judge my beverage choices that way. But then I realized that everybody has a notion of right and wrong and to this man frappaccinos were just wrong.  My worthy opponent, Sydney Barrows, writes in her memoir, Mayflower Madame, that a DNS in the call girl business stood for Do not send.   Men who were obnoxious or who had really gross apartments, she wouldnt send her girls to such men.  And she also writes, Whenever I read about a business who had done something I didnt approve of, such as a building an ugly high- rise in a residential neighborhood, I added his name to the list, just in case he ever called us.  [LAUGHTER]  Which I thought was really funny, also.  [LAUGHTER]   To some people, building an ugly high-rise is morally wrong.  Its an offense against the aesthetic order.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would submit to you that paying for sex is at least as wrong as building an ugly high- rise.  [LAUGHTER]  Perhaps more so. Why, because were using were talking about using a human being as a means to your ends.  Today people want to believe that paying for sex is just like paying for a hamburger.  But a sexual transaction is different, because it teaches on the deepest, most personal aspects of ourselves.   The proof that sex is different, in my opinion, is our response to the terrible crime of rape.  If paying for sex were as morally neutral as paying for a hamburger, well then, rape is akin to just forcing someone to eat a hamburger.  Right?   But of course it is not.  It is a horrible crime, that is serious, precisely because sexuality touches on the deepest, most personal aspect of our humanity.  And to take something so intimate, and to turn it into a commodity, has far- reaching, devastating effects, for men, women and children. Everyone agrees that after the Netherlands adopted legalization that this has added fuel to the gangs who trafficked in underage girls, and that the abuse in child prostitution exploded rather than was reduced.  Its time to ask why.  Well, firstly what we value in women, eventually trickles down to girls.   For example today we place a lot of value on hotness in women, have you noticed this?  And so, now in, for example in the Bratts Babies video, which is watched by three- and four-year-old girls by the way, you can hear cartoon babies singing songs about being hotter than hot, show what youve got, ready or not.  For three- year-olds.  What we value in women inevitably trickles down to girls.   Secondly prostitution, like all industries, is demand-led. Someone could go to great trouble manufacturing coats made from cockroaches, but since nobody wants cockroach coats, the supplier would soon find that theres no market, no demand, and no money in it, except may Ozzy Osbourne would buy it. But because prostitution is demand-led, its the paying for sex thats a problem.  Thats what creates the demand, and given that the average age of entry into prostitution is 13 or 14 years old, I think this presents a huge moral problem.   I receive a ton of emails from girls who are 14, 15, leave home, because theyve been abused, only to try to escape prostitution.  Unfortunately at the time, one writes to me, It was all I felt I had to offer the world, my body.  As you can no doubt guess, I was molested by my father for many years when I was a child.   Its why my mother let me leave.  So in a sense I was raised to believe my body had only one use, and I was worth only this one thing.  We can talk later about why the molestation rates for prostitutes are so high, why the suicide rates are so high. But, right now I wanna focus on the fact that the problem is that nobody knows if these girls are 14 or 18.  And, we think about the sheer number of sex slaves in captivity in the US, were talking about, anything from 30,000 to 50,000.  Its staggering, and its sickening.   Were talking about girls that are having sex with 20 to 30 men per day, one girl told the New York Times about her cell of traffickers, her captors offered three age ranges of sex partners, toddler to age four, age five to 12, and teens as well as the damage groupwhere they could do anything that they wanted.   When one of the Mexican child-trafficking rings was busted in a house in Plainfield, New Jersey, uh, another Mexican ring was recently busted--but this one was a few years agothe neighbors, in retrospect thought about all the cars that came, and all of the girls that left that house to buy candy, but they always said no one knew what was going on.   Im always struck that the neighbors always say this, well somebody knew what was going on because someone was paying for the sex. To those who are against trafficking, but they insist that some women have nothing else to sell but their bodies, I say that they suffer from a real lack of imagination.  About the power of the human spirit and about the strength of women in particular and if you keep up with the Harvard Business Review, you may have noticed, that theyre now talking about micro-loans to poor women and only lending them, only having these loans to poor women.  Right?   Because they notice that the poorest of women reinvest in the household and the men do not.  Sowe have to believe in the women first, it takes a risk to give them that loan. If instead we demand their bodies instead of appealing to their intelligence, its this philosophy of this is all she can do, and the not too subtle misogyny behind it, that feeds the demand and expectations that cause the problem.', 'Thank you', 'Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', \"Yeah, I think its actually the negative team that is equating, in equating marriage and dating with paying for sex.  The negative team is conflating things that should not be conflated.  First of all, in prostitution theres no shared desire.  Right?  Which means one person is an object.  That's a big difference.  Also, marriages in which there is a transactional element, in which its, okay, you give me this, Ill give you this, theres a fifty-fifty exchange of services, end up failing precisely because thats not what a marriage is.  Right? But I want to address the free choice issue, because Miss Barrows says that she doesn't recognize any of the girls, or the men.  So I just want to refresh her memory.  Because I thought her book was really interesting.  And she said, quote, quite a few of the new girls that she used had no money and nothing appropriate to wear, so I would take them to Saks and charge whatever they needed on my credit card.  They would pay me back from their future earnings.  When she found a fabulous ground floor apartment for her office, which was super cheap, the rate was made up for by making the girls sleep with the landlord, who she said was only interested in one thing, and lived in a seedy semi-furnished apartment and made them feel cheap. She says the girls weren't crazy about the plan, and really one can see why.  Is that free choice?  That doesn't sound like empowerment to me.  To me empowerment comes from actualizing your unique potential in the world.  Thats what empowerment is.  [APPLAUSE]  Realizing you're unique, and you have a unique contribution to make to this world, not being forced to sleep with a landlord to enrich somebody elses pockets. I'm sorry.\", 'Right', \"Yes, Id like to address that, because I think those are really important points that he raised.  If you show me anyone who, a man who is handicapped, I will give you a man with the same disability who has a woman who loves him.  And women are not that superficial.  And if somebody, if, I'm sorry, theres a lot of women who love men [AUDIENCE REACTION]  And, and  If theres somebody whos using prostitution as an excuse, I think that's a problem.  And I, about this issue of, that prostitution is really altruism because its feeding, you know, poor women, and thats part of the diversity, I understand that, but I fail to see how that justifies it from the male perspective.  If you really want to be altruistic, just give her a loaf of bread.\", 'Can I just respond to that, I', \"I just wanted to know, I'm just\", \"No, I do.  I just wanted to know, because I haven't heard the answer to this, on this point, if I may.  If its a question of being badly regulated, then why do we see in the countries where its been legalized, we see that the trafficking has increased.  Nobody has addressed my point that nobody asks the ages of the girls when they pay for sex, and thats the link between the trafficking. And no one has addressed that so far.\", 'Absolutely. MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER Okay. Wendy Shalit: No problem with that. MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER It is okay if a man goes to a particular masseuse because he finds her extremely attractive and is turned on by it, and only receives massage therapy?', \"I can see it getting slippery. MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER Thats, so thats okay?  All right, third question, if during that process Wendy Shalit: Not if the man were my husband.  [LAUGHS] MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER If during that process[BACKGROUND VOICE] he has an orgasm, even though the woman didn't do anything out of the ordinary, did only professional massage therapy, is that okay? Wendy Shalit: I dont know, I mean, I think this is a kind ofextreme example\", \"I think what you're\", \"I think what you're trying to do with the question is collapse the distinction between human touch and the significance of sex. And I think sex is different and just because you're giving someone a massage, I mean, theres nothing wrong with that. But I think that sexuality is something different, and you can always come up with an extreme example to collapse that distinction, but that just begs the question.\", 'Im I have to admit Im', 'Sure', 'Sorry.  Im surprised by the negatives reliance on the argument that its not going away and historically, a lot of people have been doing it.  Were not debating whether its common, to pay for sex, were not debating whether its happened, were arguing whether its right or wrong.  And, I think, I mean, if you bring up primatology, Im justI have to bring up, Mr. Tiger, your book which I really enjoyed The Pursuit of Pleasure which was a pleasure to readby the way, I must say.   I found one example really interesting, you mentioned female genital mutilation.  And you said whats significant about female genital mutilation, is that men, males want sexual access to women, but they cannot bear it when other men have access to their mates.   A common solution to the problem is the double standard, of which female genital mutilation you say is the extreme representation.  Here the effort is to try to control both sex and reproduction at once, by imposing strict controls on the sexuality of women.  In an effort to prevent their wives impregnation by men other than themselves.   Now, I think we can always, you bring up chimps and primatology, we can explain yes female genital mutilation in terms of primatology but I hope we can all agree that thats still wrong.  [PAUSE, APPLAUSE]  And, just because', 'just because the chimps can provide an explanation doesnt mean that its right.  [APPLAUSE]', '[UNCLEAR] they dont have a problem.', 'I dont think its accurate to say that we havent heard from these high-end call girls, we have heard from them.  For example in your book, Ms. Barrows, you talked about Claudette, shes the most empowered call girl, right, and she herself said this kind of work can be very taxing both physically and emotionally.   Ive never met a man who can really understand what it takes out of you.  And I think that even the most supposedly empowered call girls when they are interviewed, do say thing  [LAUGHS]  say things like this', 'No, but  [APPLAUSE]  I think that', 'Thank you, I certainly agree that sex is not a disease, so Im glad we can [LAUGHS], perhaps all agree on that  Look, nobody has addressed my point that, no one asks the ages of the girls, when they pay for sex, and that is the link between the trafficking of children, as well, and, so you wanna, I think, consider that, thats something that nobody has addressed and it makes those paying for sex responsible.   Look, I thinksince the 1960s, weve been beholden to this false dichotomy that, you know, youre either a repressed person who has no feelings, or the prudes, or youre the liberated who goes around with everyone, and treats sex casually and I dont think this dichotomy really captures the experience of most women or most men for that matter.  And I think we need to revive the idea of higher standards for both sexes.  And, that sex is a good thing, but we dont have to take advantage of the most vulnerable in our society when we choose our sexual partners.   The devaluing of women and childrens innocence that happens in a society that makes sex into a commodity, to validate that, and to declare that paying for sex is perfectly fine, is to say something about societys relationship to women and especially girls that I think would be detrimental. But also to men.  Youveyes, weve all read that Times article about sugar daddies, but to me what was so touching was the man who went on the website, and he just gave the girl a monthly stipend for her education.  And he refused to have sex with her and this is what the debate is about, its about who we want to be.  And who knows the far-reaching consequences of that, that he went on this somewhat depressing website, but he was capable of such greatness and saying no, you know what, Im not going to pay for sex.   And, if you think that what the man did didnt matter, that he supported her education without even meeting her, and you think he couldve just as easily paid for sex, and that wouldve been the same choice morally then vote for the negative team, but if you can see the beauty in that choice, which he made in the privacy of his own home, and not in any courtroom, then, vote for the proposition', 'because were not a monkey, men are not monkeys and women', 'women are not chicken.  Thank you.']\n",

      "['Well thank you very much indeed, ladies and gentlemen, its a great pleasure to be here with you tonight, nothing would be easier, than to blame everything on the bankers.  Think of Richard Fuldof Lehman Brothers.  In 2007 his compensation, for the year, was $72 million.  The year before his firm collapsed. Never to be seen again.  Or James Cayne of Bear Stearns who made $290 million, in the nine years before his firm vanished without trace.   Not only were the bankers greedy, we would agree.  They were also, in many cases, incompetent.  But I and my colleagues are not here to praise them, or to defend them.  We blame them for much of what has gone wrong.  Its just that we blame the politiciansmore.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE] Weve already heard quoted tonight that wonderful saying of Chuck Prince, as long as the music is playing you have to get up and dance but you have to ask yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, who was playing the music.  [LAUGHTER]   You know, its so easy, to heap opprobrium on Wall Street right now.  Its just too easy.  And if you noticed, thats exactly what the politicians do.  I couldnt help but notice, in President Obamas inaugural address, an allusion to greed, and irresponsibility.  And only yesterday, he was denouncing, and I quote, The recklessness and greed of the bonuses paid to executives at the insurance company AIG.   It was just the same in the last Great Depression, I think of this as the Slight Depression. [LAUGHTER]  FDR in his inaugural address, heaped scorn on the rulers of the exchange and the unscrupulous money-changers. Ladies and gentlemen, you have to ask yourselveswhy do the politicians always wax so indignant about finance at times like these?  Could it just possibly be that theyre trying to divert our attention away from Washingtons own responsibility for the debacle? What I want to do in the brief time I have available is to invite you to consider the roles played by four institutions, in bringing about this financial crisis, and I also want you to reflect on the location of those institutions.  [LAUGHTER]   The first is the Federal Reserve Board.  Its role has been to allow a housing bubble to inflate, and burst, between January of 2001 and June of 2003, the Fed cut its federal funds rate from 6.5 percent to 1 percent.   Then over three years it very gradually, by quarter- points, raised rates up to 5.25 percent.  In that time, ladies and gentlemen, house price inflation in this country, rose from 7 percent, to 17 percent a year, and it stayed above 15 percent a year, right until January of 2006. This was the period when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, proclaimed the advent of a great moderation, in economic life, yes, that was the title of his lecture in 2004.  Some moderation. The location of the Federal Reserve Board, is the Eccles Building, Constitution Avenue, Washington D.C.   The second institution, that Id like to draw your attention to is the Securities and Exchange Commission, which under Christopher Cox, allowed the leverage in the banking system to spiral out of all control, from some 12 to 1, to as weve already heard this evening somewhere in the region of 20 to 30 to 1, in the case of the big investment banks.   And that was a conscious decision by the SEC.  The location of the SEC, ladies and gentlemen, 100 F Street Northwest, Washington, D.C.  My third prime suspect is Congress, ladies and gentlemen.   Yes, Congress because it was Congress that wholly failed to supervise Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.  Those two essential institutions, which underpin the United States mortgage market. On the eve of their destruction, Fannie and Freddie had core capital, as defined by their regulator, of $83 billion, and supported around $5.2 trillion of debt and guarantees.  In other words they were leveraged 65-to-1.  The location of the Congress, Im sure youre aware of this but I cant help but point it out [LAUGHTER], is Capitol Hill, Washington D.C.  And that brings me to another nearby locationthe location of the White House. [LAUGHTER]   You know the White House played an extremely important role in creating the sub-prime mortgage disaster.  We want everybody in America to own their own home, declared President George W. Bush, in October in 2002.  Everybody, in America. He challenged lenders to create 5.5 million new minority homeowners, by the end of the decade.  He signed the American Dream Down Payment Act, in 2003.  No Presidential pressure, no sub-prime debacle.  The address of the White House, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington D.C.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, bankers are nearly always actuated by greed, so, Im sad to say, are many ordinary people too.  But its the role of government to strike a balance, between market forces, and stability.  And I move in conclusion, that we should blame Washington more than Wall Street, for this crisis.   Not least because in my view, Washington sold itself to Wall Street.  And I very much fear, is still in hock to it.  I beg to propose this motion. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, I think one way of answering that question is to ask whether every country in the world is having a financial crisis comparable to the one thats being experienced in the United States.  Now, most countries in the world are experiencing an economic crisis, largely as a consequence of what is happening here.  But theyre not all experiencing a financial crisis.  You dont have to travel terribly far, actually, to get to a country where banks are and have been adequately regulated.  That country is called Canada.  [AUDIENCE REACTION]   So if you simply look at whats happened there it becomes obvious that something was egregiously wrong with the regulatory environment in the United States.  And that is our central point.  Its not difficult to see that there was a grotesque failure on the part of regulators and politicians here.  You only have to look north of the border.', 'Thats always a good sign.  [LAUGHTER]', 'On the contrary.  Ive never said Im in favor of more regulation, simply better regulation.', '[OVERLAP]  Can I conclude my point?  If you think back to the highly regulated financial markets of the 1970s, its not as if that was a period without financial crisis.  Im old enough to remember stagflation and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K. and the problems of that period were in many ways as serious.  Certainly the recession of the early 1970s was as serious as anything weve experienced so far, though I dont rule out that this is going to get worse.  So, no, Im not in favor of more regulation.  The heavy regulations that were imposed during and after the Great Depression didnt actually prove to be that benign.  The trouble is that the deregulation, much of which was justifiable, was taken to excess.  This, I think, is the point that John Steele Gordon, Nouriel Roubini and I want to stress. And its not difficult, if one compares different regulatory frameworks around the world, to see why the U.S. was so bad.', 'Nell, Im still struggling to understand how the recipients of bribes are victims.  [LAUGHTER]  Im sorry.  [APPLAUSE]', '[OVERLAP]  I have to tell you, youre,  Im afraid your moral GPS just broke down on you there.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  Let me just say, let me just say that this is abso --', '[OVERLAP]  Well, hang on.', '[OVERLAP]  Hang on one moment.', 'Youve hit the nail on the head here.  AIG, P-I-G, AIG spent 9.7 million dollars on federal lobbying last year, in one year.  And that was down on the previous year.  Its contributed directly to candidates, to elected officials and parties, 9.3 million dollars since 1989.  It would have been much more but for campaign finance limits.  And the top recipients of the money include the Chair of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chair of the Senate Banking Committee.  Now, if that doesnt tell you that something is morally rotten at the heart of Washington, I dont know what we have to show you.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, the regulation that seems to be more important than that, actually, has to do with bank capital adequacy.  I dont think one can simply say that this financial crisis is a result of lobbying. That would be a stretch.  This crisis is much more to do with excessive leverage.  And if one simply regulates bank capital adequacy better, moves away from the self-regulation of Basel I and Basel II, I think many of the problems will be resolved.  Ive written on this --', '[OVERLAP]  Can I finish now?  I mean, I know youre eager to have at me and I always welcome interruptions.  [LAUGHTER]  I just want to remind you that the victims in the crime that were discussing here are the taxpayers and voters of the United States who are now on the hoop for, what?, nine trillion dollars? [APPLAUSE]  Now, Ive written actually on the subject -- MAN [OVERLAP]  [UNCLEAR] NIALL FERGUSON ...of campaign finance reform.  And it seems to me extremely problematic.  You know, its been cited, I dont know where you got this evidence from, Nell, that most other countries in the world dont have this problem.  This is completely untrue.  The problem of corruption is endemic in most countries and the United States is very far from being the worst.  People talk about the BRICS  Brazil, Russia, India, China  all vastly more corrupt than the United States.  The exceptions are a tiny number of countries in Europe, which for cultural reasons, seem not to suffer from chronic corruption.  Those countries do not suffer from chronic corruption  not because of regulation.  There are many, many regulations that restricts lobbying and campaign finance in Europe.  And in some European countries they work and in others they dont at all and theyre simply circumvented. So dont delude yourself.  You cant simply fix the problem of financial crises by eliminating political finance.', '[OVERLAP]  On the contrary.  I couldnt agree more.  [UNCLEAR]', 'One, [SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE]  one questions for you, Alex. You represent the fourth estate here, the press.  What, where was the press when these things were being done?  I dont remember extensive coverage of the relaxation of bank capital adequacy rules in 2004 in The New York Times.  But perhaps I missed that Krugman column.  [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]', 'This isnt  This isnt rocket science.  One set of people under discussion, owes a duty to the public interest.  Those are the politicians and regulators.  That is why we call them public servants.  And the other group, let us take the investment bankers, because of course, Wall Street is composed of many different institutions, but lets take the investment bankers. They owe a duty, to their shareholders, and also to bondholders. Now its quite interesting though the point hasnt been made yet, that to all of these investment banks performed equally badly. The fate of Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers illustrates that egregious bad management can achieve.  But the performance of Goldman Sachs was really significantly different.   Goldman actually didnt lose substantial amounts of money, though its shareholders have certainly taken some punishment.  And the punishment has been meted out by the market, to the people who invested in those banks.   They will almost certainly end up with nothing, Im fairly clear, that those people who invested in financial securities will end up with very little indeed.  And I think thats particularly true in the case of the big commercial banks.', 'And cancan I finish', 'cause this is a really important point, Bank of America, and and of course Citigroup.  But the interests of the public are to be defended by people in Washington.   That is the big difference between these two groups, and that [UNCLEAR] is absolutely clear, that we have to lay the blame on Washington.  The failure of Bear Stearns, was a disaster from the point of view of people who invested in it.   But it became a disaster for the entire US economy, and indeed the world economy, because of failures of regulation.  And those seem to me to lie very squarely in Washington D.C.', 'It helps that AIG has been bailed out of course', 'lets not lose sight of that.  [APPLAUSE]', 'The twist in the tale.', 'bad guys, Im getting there.', 'Can we do chickens and eggs now, because Im getting bored of cops and robbers.  The  [LAUGHTER]  Far be it from me to lecture an audience like this about American history but it seems to me that, the question wasnt really framed quite correctly. From', 'Thatthanks.  [LAUGHTER]  Thefrom the very inception of the United States there was a profound tension, between Washington and New York.  Alexander Hamiltons vision of the United States as a financial power was not shared by all the founding fathers and indeed James Madison was extremely skeptical about it. Thats why there was consistent resistance to the creation of a with the Bank of the United States being chartered and then gotten rid of twice, in the course of the 19th century, so   I think we need to see this as part of a long argument, within American political culture.  How powerful should New York be.  And should those other parts of the United States, lets call it Main Street, should they in fact dominate.   And I think whats happened in the last 10 years, is that New York did get the upper hand.  And I think the rest of the country, is ready for a backlash.', 'Well ladies and gentlemen, its not very often that you hear Washington D.C. defended, by a journalist, a former government attorney, and a short seller.  [LAUGHTER]  The journalist told us it would all have been absolutely fine if the banks had been as run ashad been run as well as the airlines, when did you last fly Continental, Alex?  [LAUGHTER]   Jim Chanos told us that corporate fraud is endemic in corporate America, and this goes from Enron to Madoff.  What they agree about, and here they do agree with us, is that, in many ways, Washington is in hock to Wall Street.   The difference is that Nell Minow thinks that Washington, the legislators, poor things, are the victims, in this strange case.  Now, that is where we part company.  On our side we see them anything as the victims, we see them as the key perpetrators.   And let us not forget just how far this has gone. Who was, Nell, the second biggest recipient of donations from Fannie and Freddie?  Yes, it was the President of the United States, Barack Obama.   And lets not forget that among the firms that contributed most generously to his campaign were Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, UBS, and Morgan Stanley.  What we need to contemplate, ladies and gentlemen, is the Latin Americanization of the American political system.  [APPLAUSE] This symbiotic and indeed corrupt relationship between Wall Street and Washington is the thing that is rotten at the heart of the United States, it is the principal explanation for this crisis, and that brings me to the key question you have to ask yourselves.   Who has to defend the public interest.  Is it the investment bankers, the hedge fund managers, or is it your elected representatives.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is perfectly clear, that it is Washington that has failed to defend the public interest, and I fear, it is continuing to fail to do so.  Please do vote for the motion. [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['The British always wanna file me under Steele-Gordon, with a hyphen.  [LAUGHTER]  I only use my middle name because John Gordon is about as blah a name as you can find.  Im here to argue that Washington is more at fault than Wall Street, although as everybody has admitted, Wall Street has plenty of blame to take here.   ButWall Street is not unitary.  Wall Street is nothing but a metonym for the American financial market, and it operates around the globe andnowadays, deep down into the socioeconomic spectrum.   Now some of the people who are encompassed by the term Wall Street have fiduciary obligations to their stockholders or to their depositors.  But the majority of, of Wall Streeters do not.  They are operating entirely for themselves in their self-interest. Washington on the other hand, has nothing but fiduciaries, I mean thats why governments are instituted among men, no other reason.  Now, Wall Street because it is entirely inhabited by people who are pursuing their self-interest, its notorious that there are only two emotions to be found on Wall Street, fear and greed.  [LAUGHTER]   Right now I think its perhaps time to put in a good word for greed.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  As a result, we have had panics on Wall Street roughly every 20 years. Now the Constitution came into effect in April of 1789, we had the first crash on Wall Street in April of 1792.  Then we had another one 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, 1907, 1929, 1987, and now 2008.  It seems to be just part of the beast, I mean could any of these panics have been prevented by Wall Street?  I doubt it. Being individuals, and Wall Street is nothing but a collection of individuals, not an institution, it is inherently susceptible to the madness of crowds. So, blaming Wall Street is like blaming the atmosphere for thunderstorms, its the nature of the beast, its going to happen. Washington on the other hand is supposed to be the guys with the striped shirts and the whistles on the playing field.  They make up the rules, and then they enforce them.  And then they sometimes change the rules in order to accommodate some of their friends.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  Also Alan Greenspan famously said, that it ispart of the Federal Reserves job is to take away the punchbowl when the party really gets going.  In other words its Washingtons job to prevent the crowd from going mad.  [PAUSE]  Theyve just done an incredibly lousy job of regulating Wall Street or preventing the madness of crowds.  I mean for one thing the regulatory apparatus is a total shambles. I mean we have the Federal Reserve, we have the Controller of the Currency, we have the SEC, we have the Office of Thrift Supervision.  We have the FDIC.  We have the banking regulatory authorities of the 50 states.  All of them bureaucracies, all of them devoted as all bureaucrats are to protecting turf, far and head of, of actually regulating anything.   Now, also, politicians are subject to human nature, the same as Wall Streets [sic] are. If Wall Streeters are in the business of making money, politicians are in the reelection business.  That means that theyre gonna be short term-oriented, theyre gonnawhat they want is the good headline tomorrow morning, and if that produces dreadful policy two or three or five years out, thats after the election, well worry about it then.  [PAUSE] Everybody knows that publicly-traded corporations have to submit annual reports, that these reports have to be according to standardized accounting rules, and that they have to be certified as being honest and complete by independent accountants.  This is a great idea.  Its now so obvious that nobody even thinks about it anymore, but it was invented by Wall Street.  Because the great Wall Street banks in the late 19th century, they wanted to know what the corporations were really up to, and so did the members of the New York Stock Exchange.   So the corporation screamed bloody murder at first, but the Wall Street banks said sorry, if you want us to underwrite your securities, youre gonna have to do this, and the New York Stock Exchange says if you want your securities listed with us, youre gonna have to do it, so they finally did it.   Theres still one great big player in the financial world in the United States, that is not subject to these commonsense rules.  Its called the government. For instance, you remember those budget surpluses in the later years of the Clinton administration between 1998 and 2001? They amounted to $558 billion.  So the national debt went down by $558 billion, right?  Uh, no, it went up by $400 billion.   The reason is that Social Security was put on budget.  And that means that the revenues that flow into Social Security over and above what is paid out to recipients of Social Security becomes part of the government revenue, its called an intra-governmental transfer.  Of course the money thats taken out of the Social Security trust fund is replaced with newly minted federal bonds. Which is why the debt went up.   Now, if a private company or publicly-traded company, tried to take employee contributions to the company pension fund, and call it revenue in order to perk up the bottom line, the managers of that corporation would all this very minute be playing volleyball in Club Fed.  [LAUGHTER] Or, consider Fannie and Freddie.  It was a greatFannie was a great idea, it sounded, in 1938--and it really, it liquefied the mortgage market, it helped, along with the GI Bill tremendously, to increase home ownership, and Im gonna have to quit here Im afraid.', 'I just want to point out that Nell has said that Wall Street spent six hundred million dollars lobbying Washington for regulations that Wall Street liked.  Im sure thats perfectly true.   On the other hand, Washington took the money [AUDIENCE RESPONSE] [APPLAUSE]  and produced the regulation.', 'Frank Raines of course was a Washingtonian to his fingertips. And', 'A public corporation that had unique tax advantages, and had an implicit government guarantee, even though legally there was no guarantee but it was implicit, and of course when they did collapse, the government came up and bailed them out.  Which is why they were able to borrow money at below-market rates, I mean so it was ayou know, Fannie and Freddie were economic chimeras created in Washington by the government, for purposes of making the government books look better.  And then they ended up with this beast. [APPLAUSE]', 'I dont know about human nature, I dontyou cant change it.  I mean thats virtually by definition.  But I think it was Frances Bacon who said that to rule nature you must first obey it.  And what we have to do is simply understand human nature and take it into account when we set up our rules.   One thing about compensation, is that its been very fashionable in the United States for years now to have the CEO also be the chairman of the board.  Which makes him his own boss.  And whenever you are your own boss, you are going to overpay yourself.  [LAUGHTER] Theyyeah, the CEO stuffs the board with people who are dependent upon him, other high-level management, I mean it seems to me that a corporation, unless you have enough stock to justify a seat on the board, if you work for that corporation you shouldnt sit on the board.', 'Washington could say no.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]', 'As your attorney I would advise you to stop speaking immediately', 'Well, I just wanna say that while Wall Street certainly needs reform, it always needs reforms and its constantly being reformed, it has been for 200 years.  But it doesnt need reform as badly as Washington, specifically Congress.   Which is a profoundly sick institution.  [APPLAUSE]  Institutions tend to evolve in ways that benefit their elites, and if you want the poster child for that, it is the United States Congress.  I also wanna just add one thing on the  People on the other side have been saying that Wall Street took all thistook their checkbooks down to Washington and lobbied to get the regulation they wanted rather than stricter regulation.  And actually said, therefore, Congressmen were the victims of this.   Im sorry, but Wall Street was not debauching a virgin, it was paying a harlot. [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  Thank you very much.']\n",
      "['Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  I say the beginning [sic] I support the proposition, I blame more Washington, than Wall Street for this financial crisis, but I should say the beginning, that I do agree that Wall Streeters, bankers, traders, investors, are greedy.   Sometimes they are stupid, they are arrogant, theyre incompetent.  They take too much risk, they take too much leverage, they are over compensated, all thats true.  But weve had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, we have to ask ourselves, are bankers and investors more greedy and more immoral than they were 20 years ago.   20 years ago, Gordon Gekko in Wall Street said that greed is good.  I dont think that has changed, you know, we know there is always greed, actually greed in some sense is good, is one of the drivers of capitalism.   But we know that greed has to be controlled by three things.  By fear of losses, by the fact they should not expect to be bailed out, and by a system of prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system because financial markets without ruling institutions are like the law of the jungle. And thats to me the failure, I expect Wall Street to be greedy but I expect good policy-making, trying to control the behavior, and that did not happen.  In many dimensions.  The Fed and Greenspan, after the last tech bubble went bust, cut interest rates almost to zero, and created the asset bubble, kept interest rates too low for too long.   Was most at that time, people talked about the Greenspan put [sic] in financial markets, it was the expectation whenever trouble occurs, Greenspans gonna ease things and get you out of your losses and problems.   It happened after the 1987 stock market crash and the S&L crisis easing, then in the 90s with the tech bubble, Greenspan warned about irrational exuberance and did nothing about it.  And after the tech bubble went bust, he cut interest rates from 6.5 down to 1 percent, and he created the latest bubble. So, he has been a creator of serial bubbles one after the other and when people expect to be bailed out then they behave accordingly, thats the Greenspan truth.  We created a system which people expect, that the gains are going to be privatized, and the losses are going to be socialized; this is a welfare state for the rich, for the well-connected and for Wall Street.   Thats what happened, thats public policy.  The action of the Fed regarding the asset bubble, was, you dont do anything on the way up, that was the official rule of Greenspan, Don Kohn, and Ben Bernanke, and when the asset bubble collapses, to avoid the collateral damage to the real economy, you ease aggressively.   Again, thats a buyers behavior that creates more and more bubbles.  Were running out of bubbles actually to create, with the real estate bubble, the tech bubble, the hedge fund bubble, the private equity bubble, you know, even the commodity bubble, the art bubble, were running out of bubbles to create but were easing again down to zero so, whats gonna happen this time around. As was pointed out, the job of the Fed is to take away the punchbowl when the party gets going but unfortunately not only the Fed did not take away the punchbowl, it added vodka, whiskey, gin, and every toxic stuff to it.  [LAUGHTER]  And it made the bubble even bigger.   Take the role of the Fed and the regulators, with sub-prime mortgagesGreenspan was the biggest cheerleader of this kind of financial innovation.  Zero down payment, no verification of income, assets and jobs, they called them ninja loans or liar loans.   Interest-only mortgages, negative amortization, teaser rates, all this toxic stuff or sub- prime, near-prime, prime.  The Fed and Greenspan actively said was the best thing that have happened to mortgages.  Free market, they could control it, they had the law, the power to do it, they didnt do it. Think about our public policy towards housing and mortgages. The Community Reinvestment Act, creation of Fannie and Freddie-subsidized housing.  The 20 ways in which we have subsidized, through tax policy, interested community of mortgages.   The worst, and the most unproductive form of investment, investment in housing.  Big McMansion can give you utility but doesnt increase the stock of capital in the real way of productivity of capital and labor, like, physical capital does.  We have subsidized housing in 20 different ways.  That has led to the bubble as well.   There was an ideology for the last decade in Washington, that was critical to this financial crisis.  Was an ideology of laissez-faire, Wild West unregulated capitalists.   The base of this ideology was the idea that banks and financial institutions will self-regulate.   And as we know, self-regulation means no regulation.  It was the ideology of relying on market discipline, and we know when there is irrational exuberance, there is zero market discipline. There was an ideology, and policies of relying on an internal risk- management model and as was pointed out, Chuck Prince said, when the music is playing you gotta stand up and dance, nobody listens in good times to the risk managers, theyre the party poopers, only the risk takers have the advantage in the banks, and therefore, relying on internal risk management doesnt work. Was relying on rating agencies that had massive conflicts of interest because of being paid by those they are supposed to be rating.   And this rating agency had a quasi-governmental role. They had monopoly or oligopoly power, and power to decide whose assets you can buy or not buy, that was policy that led them to have that power, and those kind of distortions. So every element of our regulatory system, has failed, you know, this Basel accord that relied on this principle, has failed even before it was implemented.  Relying on principle rather than rules, relying on light touch, rather than tough rules, a light touch means no touch at all.  The ideology of Greenspan was, every financial innovation is great, markets self-regulate. Shareholders are gonna be able to control the behavior of bankers and so on.  This was the belief in deregulation. Elements of it, actions were taken.  The repeal of Glass-Steagall that separated investment banking from commercial banking. Now we let them essentially, use deposit insurance and deposits to do 30 times leverage prop trading, thats what was allowed. Essentially deregulation of credit derivatives and derivatives, over the counter with systemic risk. Things of that sort were going on.  The SEC deciding the level ratios, 30 to 1 was okay.  Those were the policy that led then to those excesses.  There is greed, it is up to public policy to make sure that greed is controlled because otherwise if you dont have rules, institutions, and balance and prudential regulation supervision, is the law of the jungle, and unfortunately the last element of it was regulatory capture.  It was an ideology in which, the government [UNCLEAR] power taken over and controlled by lobbies where those were pushing for this kind of deregulation. So it was a massive failure of public policy, thank you. [APPLAUSE]', '[OVERLAP]  But you understate the case.', 'I think there is a strong correlation that goes to history between degree of proper regulation and financial crisis.  You know, after the Great Depression we imposed a system of strong regulations of the financial system, capital controls and for a few decades there were not that many financial crises and banking crises.  Its not just the U.S.  If you look around, for the last twenty years, you have had financial crises and banking crises and so on in a number of countries.  And what has been changing over the last twenty years, starting with Ronald Reagan and then Margaret Thatcher, the ideology became of deregulation at any cost, first in advanced economies and then in emerging markets. Now, some deregulation was good.  Nobody is in favor of excess. Even probably we swang the balance too much in the direction of too much regulation after the Great Depression and that led to not enough financial innovation.  But deregulation without a proper institution and so on has been known to lead to financial crises, like in East Asia, like in Mexico, like in Argentina and so on.  And therefore, there is a strong correlation between the quality of the regulatory and supervisory regime and whether financial crisis occurs.  Theres a trade off between the two, but thats whats really the fact that now in spite of the great moderation, low inflation and growth, these financial crises are occurring now more frequently.  These should occur once every thousand years.  Now occur every other year  more frequently, more virulent and more costly in every way.', 'You know, Washington might be corrupt but you have to think about the international dimension of this phenomenon.  There are many countries with totally different laws about lobbying and so on and there have been about fifty banking crises in the last twenty years and have occurred in very different political regimes. And if there is something in common among all of them, its that in most of these cases you had a controlled financial system and then deregulation occurred too fast and in ways that did not provide prudent regulations provision of the financial system.  As I said, you know, capitalism is based on greed.  Greed is just about incentive, about maximizing returns.  Were all greedy, you know.  First of all, you said you are the only one from Washington.  I spent two years at the White House in Treasury and also ran a successful business.  So I know about policy.  I also know about business.  I tell you, in my business Im greedy and I react to incentives but I want public policy  [AUDIENCE REACTION]  to be setting rules and regulations so that I dont misbehave and I dont cheat and I dont lie ', '...and I dont take excessive risks with taxpayers money because', 'Wait', 'I would not, you know, we know there are these issues in corporate governance because in any corporation, the shareholders cannot control the actions of the managers, there is [UNCLEAR] information the manager might want to maximize the rents and that leads to distortions, you know, the manager might [UNCLEAR] short of compensation and benefits, at the expense of the shareholders, but again, you know, Alan Greenspan, and hewhen he made his testimony, he made the admission, he saidhe admitted that one big mistake he thought that he made was that he thought the shareholders of companies could control the behavior of bankers and managers and because of that he didnt think it was necessary to further regulate this financial institution.   For 30 years of corporate finance literature, that talk about these agents problem between principle and agents when there is [UNCLEAR] information.  Its well-known for Chicago, to MIT, to anywhere else.   And he was clueless about it, how could he be clueless.  If hed known about it, there were regulation that could have minimized those distortions of compensation, of [UNCLEAR] information, of taking excessive risk through leverage, controls through more liquidity, to reducing certain type of incentive.  They were clueless about it. [SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE]', 'And in 2000 we decided to completely deregulate any credit derivatives.  They should be over the counter, not on exchange, no settlement rules, no clearing rules, no counterpart rules, nothing.   That was a mistake of policy, there were people in policy, the CFDC were against it and SEC, the Fed, everybody else said no.  Should be a free market not regulated and that led to the disaster', 'of credit derivatives [UNCLEAR]', 'policy procedure, we could have put them on an exchange', 'No, because, thats why you have international rules and we have rules about avoiding', 'that jurisdictional [UNCLEAR], you do', 'we do [UNCLEAR]', 'Huh?', 'Listen, [UNCLEAR] capital, we have international rules, there is a agreement, there has to be coordination of international regulatory policy, cause otherwise things are gonna go offshore. But instead of cracking down on offshore centers, were stimulating them, that was again a mistake of policy', 'There is a regulatory capture in almost every industry, the lobbyists take over the regulators and change things into their own interest.  But theres only one industry, the financial industry, in which this thing leads, over and over again, to financial crisis, banking crisis.   Theyre a disaster, they cost trillions of dollars.  And ask yourself what happens, and why that happens.  It happens for two reasons.  One because banks have deposit insurance and deposit guarantees.  Should we take some of the asset people money, you leverage like crazy, do crazy things.   If you gain its your money, otherwise its the taxpayer. Two, we have lender of last resort support.  When banks get in trouble the Fed comes to the rescue, and its a variant of this moral hazard of the bailout.   And thats why these banking crises occur over and over and over again, and theyre becoming more disrupting, more expensive and so on.  That has to do key, with exactly our regulatory system, there is something wrong about it and if we dont fix it these things are gonna happen, and the costs are gonna come even bigger, again,  people are greedy in every industry, people in every industry try to avoid regulation sometimes with lies, sometimes by cheating or avoiding, whatever.  Thats human nature, why it leads to disaster in financial industry, because we have the system.', 'Well, you know, I go back again to the issue of incentives on international scales, financial crises do not occur everywhere, there are countries like Canada and many others that have better regulators and supervised financial system, and these things dont occur.   Its not that Canadians are more moral or less greedy or less incompetent or more competent or more arrogant than anybody else and, same thing for Europeans and Asians and you name it.  Human nature is similar.   And by the way they are not crooks, you know, everybody responded to incentives, everybody wanted to maximize profit returns and whatever, thats what market economies are all about, but we know that human behavior can lead to excesses in society, thats why we have institution in society, otherwise the law of the jungle.   And in this case of financial market you know that greed and excesses can lead to damaging effects, thats why prudential regulation, supervision of financial institution, is so much more important so at the end of the day, its good public policy, it makes a difference between crisis occurring or not occurring, thats the lesson of the last 50 years, its not about human nature, or greed or being criminal', 'Well, you know, its not a debate about robbers and cops because there is a huge amount of evidence that actually, financial development is very beneficial for economic activity.  Companies are more financially developed, provide lots of services, you know. Credit cards, mortgages, commercial real estates, insurance, risk hedging, you name it, its very important and beneficial but we know that when there is financial innovation sometimes becomes excessive, there is asset bubble, there are credit bubble, excessive restaking. People become greedy and all the rest, and you can have a system that is so regulated like some countries, like India, whenever theres a bank that is ever failing, but you wont actually, the market economy where sometimes, some banks fail. But you dont want a system which everybodys collapsing, you have systemic risk.  And the distinction there is you want innovation, like in any country because its gonna be beneficial, but you want to avoid crisis, and to avoid crisis, you need appropriate rules, institution, prudential regulation of the financial system.   Not too much, not too little, its a trade-off, its not a black-and-white.  And the difference between a system that works, that has innovation and provides benefits, and avoids a crisis and one which crisis occur over and over again, has nothing to do with Wall Street or the greedy bank as you name it. Has to do with the quality of public policy.  Proper supervision and regulation.  Thats the distinction, has been always the case across countries, across history, so lets look at the big picture.']\n",

      "['Thank you very much and thanks to everybody for having this forum.  Its very interesting.  And thanks to all of you for coming. The first premise that I want to propose is that the art market is a financial market now.   It has become this and it is a totally unregulated financial market.  I will also try to define ethical.  I define ethical as a protection for the investor or art collector and unethical as efforts to deceive. I will narrowly define the stock market as publicly traded equities.  Otherwise I risk sailing off into Bernie Madoff-land and uncharted waters.   The art market really is divided into two parts  the private art market, meaning the galleries, and the public market, the auction houses. In the private market there are protections of the purchaser in the form of the uniform commercial code in New York and the self-policing bodies like the Art Dealers Association of America. So Im gonna foc...--  These are not totally protective but they serve a purpose.  Im gonna focus then on the auction market. The press usually defines the art market as the auction market for contemporary art, which gets all the press  where prices have ballooned in recent years.  And therefore it has become press- worthy, because big prices make for press.  In the past few years there has been rampant speculation.  Until the middle-Nineties a work that appeared at auction, if it reappeared within five years it would be virtually unsellable.   And now works appear almost immediately after being purchased or at least they did until the recent unpleasantness in the contemporary market, starting in November. And because theres a new wave of speculators at each auction. This all really began in the middle-Eighties, when art became monetized by the press and the financial institutions into a financial market, Sothebys launched a financial services arm, Citibank an art advisory department and so on.  Banks lent money on art and auction houses lent money to buy art. Sothebys Chairman went to jail for colluding with Christies on auction commissions.  Now art had become a serious financial asset.  Whereas before the Eighties the market was tiny, it now became global.  Thousands of people became involved.  Billions of dollars changed hands.  But except for foreign governments claiming repatriation of antiquities and Holocaust restitutions and despite the sums of money involved and vast numbers of participants, government seems to treat art as frivolous, as a luxury market with no regulation or oversight. As just one example:  in the Bush Administration tax code, when the capital gains tax was reduced from twenty-eight per cent to fifteen per cent art remained at twenty-eight per cent  apparently because it was treated by the government as a luxury, not an asset class.  The stock markets are highly regulated by law.  There are also protections for individuals who trade in the market through fiduciary, mutual funds and so on.  Regulation came about as a protection for individual investors.  The art market, on the other hand, is totally unregulated.  Things occur, particularly in the auction market, that are deliberately contrived to deceive the unsophisticated individual and that would be subject to criminal penalties in the stock market.  The most universally encountered is chandelier bidding, which means fake bids to entice bidders into competition. Whereas regulations exist in the stock market to provide transparency, chandelier bidding is specifically designed to deceive, to imply that there is competition when there isnt any. Novice buyers usually enter the market through auctions because they have no other way to establish values.  And unlike securities, there are no two works of art that are identical or are in the same condition or have the same credentials.  The only source of price comparison is auction data bases.  But, again, comparisons are flawed.  The novice auction bidder believes his only exposure is his incremental bid.  He assumes that the under-bid represents a willing and able competitor.  But if there wasnt any under-bidder?  What if the bid was a phantom, a chandelier bid? When some years ago the issue of chandelier bidding was raised in New Yorks Consumer Affairs Department, the auctioneers cried that to eliminate it would take the drama out of auctions and they threatened to quit New York City.   When I was quoted as saying that when I want drama I go to Broadway [LAUGHTER] I was called a horses butt.  [LAUGHTER]  The only  I changed that word because my wife wouldnt let me, or somebody in my office wouldnt let me use it.  [LAUGHTER]  The only result of this city inquiry was that the auctioneers were forced to identify items in which they have a financial interest or that are guaranteed or most recently in which there are irrevocable bids identified by miniscule symbols virtually invisible or incomprehensible to all but professionals.  Otherwise, the auctioneers prevailed with their deceptive practices.  In addition, the auction catalog disclaimers make it basically caveat emptor, as far as authenticity and condition are concerned. In the private gallery market the invoice establishes the guarantee, by law.  The real reason for the auctioneers ethical ambivalence is the dramatic shift in role over the last forty years from agent for the buyer.  Then as demand started exceeding supply, first as agent for both buyers and sellers and then primarily for the sellers, the buyer paying almost all of the commission guarantees and irrevocable bids followed swiftly as further enticements to sellers.  But the auctioneers role remained ambiguous.  The auctioneer was now wearing at least two invisible hats and when he had an equity in the object, three.', 'Because, because', 'Why be in it  In all deference to Jerry, the subject here is not the art world.

[APPLAUSE]  I believe that nothing else has much val intrinsic value than art. I dont believe in anything else, I dont believe in green pieces of paper that they print in Washington, ad infinitum to the trillions of dollars.   I believe in art.  Howeverthere is an art market. This was created by the press, publicizing these huge prices, and by the financial institutions, who are lending money on it, who have set up departments to advise their clients on buying art.   It has become, it has been transformed, metastasized, into a financial market.  And because it is a financial market, for better or for worse, although I would prefer that it were not, because I am passionate about buying art, Id rather buy it and this makes it more difficult for me, and more expensive for me, the fact is, that it is a financial market. And as such, it is totally unregulated.  And in my view things go on in this market that could not happen in the securities markets.  People would go to jail.  Okay, you cant pretend that theres a buyer when there isnt, theres no transparency at all. And what Im saying is, Im not saying to regulate the prices of art because, that is between the artist and his dealer as Chuck says. But the fact is nobody is sayingnobody is saying, something thats not true.  Im saying that, in the auction market, and I agree that auctions are indispensable to establish values and for people that wanna go in and acquire art  In that market, there is no transparency, and there is deception, deliberate deception. And I do believe, that it ought to be regulated.  That this kind of activity Now, I wish all of you to vote [LAUGHS] for our position here.']\n",
      "['Thank you.  Im going to make some points to support what Richards already begun on our behalf.  And these will be made more in the way that a drunk might use a lamppost --  in support rather than illumination.   [LAUGHTER]  however, an early statement from 1932, pre-regulation of the stock market, which FDR managed, importantly, to begin over here, began with the remarks that it was needed because of shocking disclosures of low standards in high places.  This possibly is something that could be applied to the art market, I fear.  The stock market in London has a dictum.  The dictum is:  Meum dictum pactum. This means, My word is my bond.  And it is one of the important maxims in the art world, but unfortunately, it is not one that necessarily is worth banking upon.  Im gonna illustrate three reasons why the motion:  The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market, for me, holds water.  The first is that there is no real regulation.  The second, that there is no transparency in the market, and the third, that there are absolutely no barriers to entry.  The first, no real regulation  let me explain by telling you a story against myself.  In 1989 and 1990  its a long time ago  I was in short trousers.  I had a gallery in London already. I came to New York on the day of one of the big auctions.  And I made a deal with an art dealer here in New York  somebody who is extremely prominent to this day  to buy eight paintings by the German painter, George Baselitz  an artist who I still greatly admire.  And I agreed to buy these for 2.4 million dollars, which at the time seemed an extraordinary amount of money to me.  I think I was twenty-four years old at the time.  And I left the gallery of this man Id made the deal with.  And I waited because there was one similar painting that night in auction in New York. And the painting made eight hundred thousand dollars.  I went to bed that night feeling very clever.  The next morning I got a telephone call from the dealer, who told me that the deal did not stand and that he was gonna walk away from it. And of course I was outraged.  But under the UCC regulations, anything that is not written on paper and is a transaction above five hundred dollars is not enforceable.  Clearly here, ethics and the law were not working hand in hand.  Ethically, I felt he was doing something that was appalling.  Legally, he was absolutely right, he could do it.   That illustrates my first point, that there is no real regulation.  The second point that there is no transparency in the market has been touched upon by Richard, in his remarks about the auction houses and the creation of rings.   Rings are relatively simple to create, it needs a group of people who stand outside the framework of the auction houses, and they decide to promote an artist, its very easily done with a young artist, and I can think of one at the moment in the Middle East who is an interesting young painter whose work has rocketed in price, from tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars, in the space of less than two years.  A group of people bought a lot of pictures, they each owned individually, group of pictures, and they started to put these pictures into auction, they then go to the auctions, they get groups of people bid them up, and thereby they feather their own nests. Andthis draws attention of the press, the press attention to the artist, and its a self-fulfilling prophecy that this artist starts to go up in value, and by a process of osmosis, the ring benefit from the auction house activity that theyve begun.  This is not transparent to the outside viewer, but to art world professionals, it is quite obvious when this is happening.  The last point, and possibly the most important point, is that, unlike the stock marketthere are no barriers to entry.   To become an art dealer, you need to have a pulse.  [LAUGHTER]  You need to be able to count and probably you need two eyes in your head.  But beyond that anybody can be and call themselves an art dealer. There was an extraordinary scenario that took place here, predominantly here in New York, with an art dealer, so-called, called Michael Cohen, some of you may know about this but Im going to use him as an example of an extraordinary situation, where he began to trade in commodities, and in the stock market, and ran into a lot of financial trouble. This was not his business, this was what he was making money doing on the side.  But he realized that he could solve his problems, where there was an absolute call on his money at 30 days, and he had to deliver, by using other peoples paintings as collateral.   Some of them, he parked even in the auction houses, his level of chutzpah has to be seen to be believed, he actually managed to sell a Titian that was on the wall of the Met. [LAUGHTER]  In any case, this gentleman eventually did become unseated.   And he has disappeared, last sighted in Brazil.  And if anybody can help us out with his whereabouts, Jerry Saltz, our resident investigative journalist would love to write a story all about it.  [LAUGHTER] I use him as an example, there are very clear demands placed upon people, who go into the stock market, the stock market is regulated, these individuals are fingerprinted, they are members of a licensed body of people who are allowed to trade.   Their backgrounds are heavily investigated before they begin.  This is not the case with the art world.  And for these three reasons, there is no regulation, no transparency, and no barriers to entry. These are the reasons that I believe absolutely, that the motion, the art market is less ethical than the stock market, cannot be disputed. [APPLAUSE]', '[PAUSE]  Thats a good question.  Im not sure I know the answer to that.  So Im gonnasay something completely different, Im gonna say  [LAUGHTER]', 'Im  [LAUGHTER]  Yeah, Im not gonna answer the question at all, Im gonna say that actuallyI wanted to agree with Jerry. And I wanted to say that, hes absolutely right, were all in this for the same reason.  But actually tonight, were here to debate a very specific motion which has nothing to do with the fact  [APPLAUSE]  the fact that', 'that we are all involved with art because we love it and because its our lives and because we are not able to do anything else [LAUGHS], speaking from my own point of view.  [LAUGHTER]  I had to invent a job for myself cause nobody else would have me. But actually were here because we love art, because it drives us, because it thrills us and because, the exciting thing about the art world and the people that make it is that it is a   I always think of it as a running race, where the great artists pass the baton from one to the other, and the really great artists get to carry it forward.  And for me seeing those artists and', 'trying to help them', 'Trying to help them go forward is a byproduct of what we do, and as a gallery, yes, we sell the work but also we sometimes have to help them create the work.', 'And by the way, Jerry, in case you didnt realize, I look after Vito Acconci.  [LAUGHTER, OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'Hes doing wonderful things.', 'I think thats two really important points, first of all were not actually talking about money here.  Were talking about ethics. And, were talking about whether a market is ethical.  Not about whether people make lots of money or dont make lots of money, were just talking about ethics.', 'Whether one market or another market is ethic', 'And the other thing I think is really important to understand is that, Im not asking for regulation in the market, I know that that wont happen, and I, yes, okay, mea culpa, I am a cannibal, I am eating my own as it were, Im Jonathan Swifts modest proposal, I am suggesting that we eat our own children, through the market. But actually, I am a great devotee of the market, I think that its inconsistencies, like Adam, are one of the great attractions of the market.  And the fact that nothing is ever the same yesterday as it will be tomorrow is one of the extraordinary things about the art world.', 'No were not', 'were notJerry, sorry, what were saying here, is thatand if you look at the debate motion again, we are saying that it is more unethical than the stock market, thats what were debating', 'Im not debating whether its done damage or not, I am simply debating the point, that', 'I', 'Im', 'Im sure there may be but Im sure I dont know them. [LAUGHTER]  I think your question is an interesting one but it actually has no bearing on the motion that were discussing here. Because this motion is a purely hypothetical motion, so, Im gonna bring this back, and Im going to agree with', 'Now Im completely lost.  [LAUGHTER]   I think that the art market is open for manipulation because its unregulated, I think it is unregulated because, historically, its found its own way of operating because its just simply not possible to regulate this market, and it would be a ghastly thing, if it ever could be regulated.  A lot of the excitement and fun would go out of it.  So to answer your question, do I know a lot of bad apples in the art market, no.  But the art market, when we have instances of things going wrong and manipulations and unethical behavior, attracts a huge amount of attention, a disproportionate amount of attention because the art market is very exciting, it is very well-reported, it always has been, because, it is also the cradle of  Its an expression of humanity, its an expression of something that is above the humdrum essence of daily life, its something that when it is truly great, it takes us into another realm, into a realm that hopefully, will have cultural credibility for years and decades and centuries to come.', '[OVERLAP]  But can I go another direction with that?', \"I just wanted to take you in a slightly different direction.  If you go back nearly a hundred years and you think of, not an art critic but a very influential art historian --  Bernard Berenson, who was in cahoots with Duveen  here you have an incredibly powerful manipulation which subsequently many other art historians have found to be entirely unethical and which museologists and museum directors have had to unravel as a result of the collusion between Joseph Duveen and Bernard Berenson.   So, I'm just pointing that out as a, a fascinating manipulation of the market from an art historical point of view.\", 'I wanted to remind you, the idea that regulations are what force ethics, and in an unregulated market like the art market, it is hard to force people to adhere to ethical principles.  Without ethical principles however, and with the manipulations of market, we can look, for instance, to the tulip market in 1636.  We create bubbles, and these bubbles are intrinsically unhealthy. You may all know Charles Mackays extraordinary book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. People follow each other, because they feel that there are financial opportunities.  Especially when these markets are unregulated.  The tulip market crashed, but it was regulated by the Dutch government, rather too late.   But, the point here is, that the art market is unregulated, it is open to unethical behavior because its unregulated.  Not how often is it unregulated, but the fact that it, it is intrinsically unethical because it is, as I said before, it is not regulated, it is not transparent, and there are, most importantly, absolutely no barriers to entry.   So that anybody may come in and manipulate the market.  Whether we like them or dislike them, whether we admire them or not, is absolutely irrelevant.  The important point here, is to remember that, the market is intrinsically open to manipulation, and intrinsically unethical.   Whether its actually happening or not, is not important to the debate tonight.  What is important is to understand, that the market is intrinsically unethical.']\n",
      "['Thanks so much.  I just wanted to remind you all that March 17th is Blame Washington more than Wall Street.  I do blame Washington.  April 21, Its wrong to pay for sex, I do think its wrong to pay for sex.  Unless you get a good deal.  [LAUGHTER] And May 12th, Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere and it is, so, that gives you a hint of where I stand here, Im here to basically argue the point that the art market is less ethical than the stock market, which it is. I want to start off by reminding you all what ethical actually means, cause I wasnt even sure what it meant when I thought about it.  Ethical means being in accordance with the rules or standards for right conduct, ethics means this is correct and right conduct and practice.   The standards of a profession, and this is the standards of the profession of the art dealer were talking about.  An example here is, it was not considered ethical for physicians to advertise.  It is not ethical for physicians to advertise, I thought well why cant physicians advertise if theyre good.   And the reason is physicians are there to help people. Physicians are supposed to help you with your health.  And therefore its not really a business.  Just like the art market is not really a business but then how can it be a market and not be a business?   We get into this wholeethical question, about art and the market, these two things are really at loggerheads in a way.  And I thought, do art dealers advertise.  Because it would not be appropriate for physicians to advertise.  Do art dealers advertise, and I thought, every art dealer I know, advertised heavily. As a matter of fact, auction houses advertise, everyone advertises, and therefore, it immediately made me feel well perhaps, advertising is a sign that this is a business and not simply aboutethics and proper conduct.   Now, in terms of the stock market, the SEC regulates public companies.  And the reason for that, is really to protect the public.  If it werent for protecting the public, in fact the government would let everyone do whatever they wanted to do with public companies, private companies and whatnot.   We have many, many rules and regulations for the financial markets and of course more rules to break, is what many people will think, or more rules to skirt.  But the reality is that those rules are there.  Now on the other hand, we have works of art, which are inherently unique. Each work of art is quite different.  Even if there is a Degas which sold today for $19 million, that Degas is one of I believe 20 that he made and that particular Degas was cast after his death, thats what we call a posthumous cast, so, in my view that Degas is quite different from a cast that Degas made during his lifetime. How could we regulate Degass Danseuse, even if two were exactly the same.  The skirt is going to be slightly different, the patina was slightly different.  One of them got dropped on the floor and restored, the other one didnt.   So therefore, since art is inherently, each work of art is inherently unique, its extremely difficult to regulate.  So I was trying to imagine how we would regulate the art world in order to make it truly ethical.  And I was thinking we would have to create something called the AEC, as opposed to the SEC we would have the AEC which is the Art Exchange Commission. This would be a counterpart to the SEC, perhaps a subdivision, in which case we could go after Madoff and we could also go after art dealers who have sold things that are not correct.  I think that that whole idea of regulating the art world is in and of itself impossible.   And so then I thought, well, what are these standards for proper conduct.  How can we be proper, how can we be ethical, in the art market.  And I quickly thought of six fast reasons which make it difficult to ensure that every trade in the art market will be ethical.   Theof course, many of the dealers and many of the people at the auction houses and many of the artists are my dear friends, and I dont mean to say that any of them are unethical.  My point is rather that the art market itself is ripe for unethical behavior. That doesnt mean that the participants in it are unethical.  My personal feeling is that the people in the art world that I know are the most wonderful and ethical people I know in any environment, in any business.  But that being said, the entire market is ripe for anything to happen.   For example.  Stocks, when stocks trade, you pay a commission.  You can pay between one and 15 cents, you like the guy, you pay 15 cents, hes given you good information, you can pay 50 cents, you can give him a dollar.  You can trade with Charles Schwab.  Youits a penny a share.   When youre buying a work of art, you have no idea what that real commission is.  The art market is all fair game, its caveat emptor.  Unless youre going in with a dealer that you know, or a work of art that you know or you have a consultant who you trust, you have no idea what the commission is. You dont know if its 10 percent, 15 percent, yes, common practice is 10 percent.  Common practice in the art world, 10 percent commission.  My question to you is, 10 percent of what. The next point which I think is pretty much going to blow this up, is the insider trading.   Now, you know that insider trading is wrong when youre trading public securities.  Matter of fact insider training is wrong when youre trading bonds, when youre trading stocks.  Now, you know, its illegal on Wall Street and the reality is in the art market, we live on inside information.   I mean the whole art market is based on inside information, I mean thats the whole idea of art.  You know, there are the insiders and then there are the outsiders.  Yes, theres the concept that art is for everyone and art will transcend, and we all want that feeling, I mean, certainly we want the art thats going to speak to everyone. However, the reality is, when youre actually buying art, when youre a collector, when youre reaching into your pocket and you need to spend money, you want to know everything, at least I do. Its not only about love, of course I love, but, I cant buy everything in the world.   So I need to choose what Im gonna do with my resources and I wanna have all that information, especially the inside information that I know that dealer has. Another type of inside information would be if a young artist is going to a big gallery.   This is a critical thing to know.  The other thing is opportunities for currency exchanges.  Geographic.  A painting in one country is worth less than a painting in another country.  Does that make dealers unethical?  Absolutely not.  But the whole system is ripe for anything to happen, and thats the beauty of art, and the art market. [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]', 'I dont think thats true', 'It seems to me that, the question becomes, you know, is the proposition correct, in a systemic definition, or is it correct in practice.  Meaning, is the system that is the art market, the unregulated art market inherently more open to unethical behavior', 'than a regulated market.  Now your question is, in practice', 'is the art market actually unethical.  And I have tremendous respect for the other side here.  Speaking of ethics I think that had I chosen the other side, I wouldnt have made the panel because they had more people on that side than this one.  So I sensed that there was a spot for me over here.  And Im arguing this side  [LAUGHTER]  Which has a lot to do about art and the art market, you know', 'you have to feel your way through.   [LAUGHTER]  That being said, Ithe people that I deal with are the people that I think are ethical, I choose people that I have a relationship withthat are either my friends or I have a good feeling about them, and do things happen, of course, everything happens', 'in this world anything can happen.  That being said, our side has definitely--you know, were going downhill here in the sense that we dont have any rules in the art market whereas the public is protected by the SEC as we were saying, perhaps imperfectly so but thats the effort, the public can enjoy the art world that Jerry Saltz has laid out for us and certainly should support the art world that Chuck Close has laid out for us and, and I do feel very strongly that way.  Nonetheless, there are no rules, theres no inherent value, I mean, the other side literally said, let me see here.  Artists where is it, There is no intrinsic value, only extrinsic value, thats Chuck Closes words so, if there is no intrinsic value, thenits ripe for unethical behavior.', 'We dont agree with you, we are for this proposition.  We wanna win the debate.  They are against.  [LAUGHTER]  So, were not all together here, were for the proposition, theyre against. [LAUGHTER]  So if you agree with us, you wanna vote over here. [LAUGHTER]  That being said, it was very interesting that, Richard was saying something against the auctionsbut Chuck was chiming in, and so I feel obliged to say something for the auction houses, [LAUGHTER]  just to balance it out here. Remember, if something sells at auction, somebody bought it. That is a fact.  Doesnt matter if they chandeliered it, doesnt matter if they advertised it, I dont care if they shined it with shoe polish.  Somebody bought it, and we can actually see that.  That is not possible in the private market, sofor better or for worse, this market wouldnt exist without the auction houses, and we need them as collectors, I think as dealers, and I think, artists often dont understand that, the auction market, the auction house actually makes this a market and is ultimately to everyones benefit.', 'This is not an age of certainty, my friends  [LAUGHTER]', 'Thank you, John.  [LAUGHS]  The, Jerry, I just wanna say [MICROPHONE FEEDBACK]  to all of you over there, I do feel for you, and Im with you  [LAUGHTER]  But, of course, Im with my teammates here and  [LAUGHTER]  I appreciate the difficult time youve had tonight  [LAUGHTER]  And I love', 'everything that you said, you know, but the reala minute 30, okay.  Art is based on two things as far as I can tell, and, Jerry said were all learning on the job, and Iyou know what, I couldnt agree more.  Im learning right now.   But the two Cs are consensus and confidence, and these are there, things that the art market is built on, so what makes a great artist.  Its sort of this Platonic concept, is there such a thing as great art? Perhaps, but, in whose mind, the thing that makes art valuable is consensus, what makes Picasso Picasso, because everyone thinks hes great.  Someone thinks hes crap and that doesnt really matter because people are still paying a lotta money for it. So, consensus is what makes the art market, and then we need that extra thing that often the auction house brings, a dealer can bring, which is confidence, and, those are the two things that, that make us feel comfortable with art being valuable.   The reality is though that the ethical side is up to the individual that youre dealing with.  There is no way to guarantee that anything is worth anything.  And so, when were speaking in terms of Dave Hickeys intrinsic and extrinsic value, the intrinsic value of art, is perhaps infinite.  But the extrinsic value is really something that is almost impossible to measure on any given day.']\n",

      "['Well, while he was running, Barack Obama was heard to say that he would bankrupt our coal industry.  Now, I dont doubt Washingtons ability to bankrupt almost anything in the United States.  But, [APPLAUSE] but China is currently adding a hundred gigs of coal electricity a year.   Thats one entire United States worth of coal consumption every three years.  There is no end in sight and there are other countries, all across the globe, following exactly in its footsteps.  So let me say here quickly, where I end up and then try and tell you how I get there. We rich people of the planet cant stop the other five billion poor people from burning a couple of trillion tons of carbon that they have within easy reach.  We cant even make any real dent in global emissions because the emissions are growing too fast, they involve too much involvement by very poor people who cant easily change their ways and because those poor people are part of the same global economy as us.And if we are foolish enough, which we could well be, we will let carbon worries send our jobs to their shores and they will grow even faster and carbon emissions will grow faster still.  It should go without saying, we dont control global supply of carbon.  Ten countries ruled by thoroughly nasty people control eighty per cent of the worlds oil, a trillion barrels currently worth fifty trillion dollars at current market prices. Now, if I told you that there was that value in gold where it actually is, where the oil actually is, you would scoff at any suggestion that anything we could do, no matter what we spent, could force those people to keep that oil in the ground.  Its all theyve got.  They will drill it.  They will pump it.  They will find a market and somebody will burn it.  Poor countries all around this planet are sitting on a trillion tons of readily accessible coal.   Its all theyve got for energy beyond the other great carbon reservoir of the planet, which is the rain forests and the soils, which they also, by and large, control.  They will squeeze the carbon they can out of cheap coal, cheap forests and cheap soil, because thats whats there, unless they can get something even cheaper than that. And that, as I shall discuss shortly, is going to take some doing. We no longer control demand for carbon, either.  The five billion poor people are already the main problem  not us.  If you have heard otherwise, you have heard wrong.  Collectively, the poor already emit twenty per cent more greenhouse gas than we do. We burn a lot more carbon individually, of course, but they have a lot more children.  Their fecundity has beaten out our gluttony and the gap is now widening very fast.  [APPLAUSE]  China, not the United States, is now the largest emitter of greenhouse gas on the planet and it will soon be joined by others.  Its only a matter of time.  And finally, the poor countries have made perfectly clear that they are not interested at all in spending what a low carb diet would cost.  They have more pressing problems.  So it really does come down to this.  First, can we give the world something cheaper than carbon? The moon shot law of economics says, Why, yes, we can.  If we just really put our minds to it, it will happen -- atom bomb, moon landing, energy, you name it.  No, not this time.  Fossil fuels are very cheap because they concentrate a lot of energy in a small space.  You find a mountain of coal and you can just shovel gargantuan amounts of energy into the boxcars.  Renewable fuels like sun and wind are much harder.  Windmills are now fifty story skyscrapers, yet one windmill generates a piddling two megawatts.  A jumbo needs a hundred megawatts to get off the ground.  Google is building hundred megawatt servers just to move bits around.  Meeting New York Citys total energy demand would require something like thirteen thousand windmills spinning at full speed or more like fifty thousand windmills scattered all over the state because youve gotta have enough of them to be sure enough of them are in the windy spots. What was your Mayor thinking when he suggested that you might just tuck them into Manhattan?  I mean, that kind of thinking betrays a very common view that,  [APPLAUSE]   In fact, it betrays a profound ignorance about how difficult it is to get huge amounts of energy out of these very dilute, thin forms of fuel, like sun and wind.  Renewable technologies are not moving down the same plummeting cost curves that weve seen in our laptops and our cell phones.  When you replace conventional with renewable everything gets bigger, not smaller  much, much bigger  and costs get higher, not lower.  China and India wont trade three cent coal for fifteen cent wind or thirty cent solar. And if we force those expensive technologies on ourselves, we will certainly end up doing more harm than good.  Twenty percent of the planet buys much less carbon, the other eighty percent will be delighted to buy at a lower price.  The real jobs will go where the energy is cheap, just as they go where the labor is cheap because manufacturing and heavy industry require so much energy.  And in a global economy you cant possibly compete if youre paying two or three times as much as your competitors for an essential input.  Green jobs means Americans paying other Americans to chase carbon while the rest of the world builds power plants and factories.  But the rest of the world is less efficient than us and less careful.  A massive transfer of carbon and industry and jobs from us to them will raise carbon emissions.  It will not lower them. So, unless we are going to ask the Pentagon to take charge  and good luck with that -- we dont have the power to deliver any lasting reduction in global carbon emissions at all.  Whatever we might achieve in the very short term at home,  we cant control the global supply of carbon.  We cant control the five billion poor people who desperately want to burn it and who already control more of the demand than we do.  And we cant control the flight of jobs and industry to where the industry is cheap.  Frantically chasing the impossible and falling flat on your face doesnt make things better.  It often makes things worse and its never worth the money.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Yeah, but [UNCLEAR]', 'How they meet energy needs', 'We know how theyre meeting their energy needs, they are taking down the rainforest, they are soaking carbon out of their land, and they are burning coal, I mean we actually know thisyou know, all this talk about externalities   If you dont know this, the Kyoto system divides the world.

How can we even talk about externalitiesif we said to you, folks, were getting an externality system worked out for this group just right here, but its only this group here, all the rest of you do what you like, what do you think would work with that system, nothing would work.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Right.', 'But Adam', 'Butbut Adam, your side itself is proposing no cap on 80 percent of the world that currently generates fifty', '54 percent', '54 percent of, of the', 'the greenhouse gases.', 'Well, if anybody took', 'a discussion of jobs as contempt, I truly apologize, I feel no contempt, Im trying to talk about macro-economic effects in a global economy, you know, many people feel there is a global economy and things do move like that.   As for saying, you know, their fecundity has beaten our gluttony, I dont know which is ruder, to be, you know, gross and eat too much, or to have lots of children [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE], but I dont mean any contempt by it, Im just saying it is an actual fact.', 'It really is the truth  [APPLAUSE]', 'You know, there is no field of policy you will ever find and I spent 25 years in Washington watching this, where you will find a greater gap between what people actually do, and what they say theyre gonna do, wanna do, should do, oughta do.   The EU itself, the people who are most frantic about this and who signed this stuff, theyre notnone of them or possibly one of them will meet their Kyoto commitments.  They issued tradable permits, and promptly depressed the value to virtually zero because they issued so many, they were all worried about job-export issues.   I mean, you know, you just cannot talk about what people are gonna do for anything.  China is, in fact, building coal plants like crazy.  Okay?  They say theyre gonna build more but I couldnt care less what they say.  They are actually doing it.  They are the worlds biggest emitter today.  How can you ignore the worlds biggest emitter?', '[OVERLAP]  And so youll tax our plants but not theirs, right?', 'Well, let me start by saying this:  There is a very big difference between saying we ought to keep studying something and saying we ought to put in place forcible mechanisms today that will force people to adopt technology today.  All right?   Because, you know, you can talk all you like about solar.  The price point youve gotta beat is three cent coal.  If you dont beat three cent coal youre not there.  It is of no interest that you can beat, [APPLAUSE]  its of no interest that you can beat fourteen cent gas, okay?, or, its ', '[OVERLAP]  Well, the, the old ones  and not in China they dont. Believe me, okay?  The marginal cost of coal generation is miniscule and thats your price point.  Now, researching to see if you can beat it someday  I like that.  Im a techno utopian. Anybody who reads anything I say, I love technology.  Ive, in my book I say, Someday well get there.  But, you know, telling people today, You go ram it into twenty percent of the country   I dont want to repeat myself.  We will move these same industries over to China, as in fact it was just being suggested a moment ago, and they will make the products instead and make them dirtier.  We will increase carbon emissions that way. MAN [OVERLAP, INAUDIBLE] PETER HUBER If we keep it at home at least [APPLAUSE]  well have the scrubbers on the darn coal plants, even if were not taking the carbon out yet.', 'But, could I take a first, could I take a crack at peak oil?', 'Well, and now I am done, I am going to get personal and nasty. And Im going to talk to you over there, and you. [POINTING INTO THE AUDIENCE]  Yeah, you know who you are  and also you. And like a medieval priest, you know, there are carbon brokers out there today who will sell you an indulgence that will forgive all your carbon sins.  [LAUGHTER]   It will run you about five hundred dollars for five tons of carbon, which is about what the typical American needs  or about two thousand dollars per typical household.  Your broker will spend the money on something good  most likely cleaning up hog farms in Brazil. But if you really want to make a difference, you must send a check large enough to forgive four Brazilian households, too, because they cant afford that.  So to cover all five households  the rich one and the four poor  make it four thousand dollars. And you probably forgot to send a check last year and who knows?, some of you might even forget it for the next eight years. Lets cover all the sins, you know, one backed, this years and eight in advance.  Youll feel so much better if youve already paid for these future sins.  Lets make it ten years, forty thousand dollars.  Now, if you honestly believe that substantial reductions in carbon emissions are worth the money, you will, sadly, vote against the proposition.  But then you must, you absolutely must, scurry right back home and send your check in because if you dont you will have burdened your already sooty soul [SCATTERED APPLAUSE]  with an extra five tons of self- righteous hypocrisy.  And you cant possibly, [LAUGHTER]  you cant possibly afford what it will take to forgive that.  [APPLAUSE] Your other --  [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]  Your other option, your other option is to keep your money in the pocket and vote for the proposition.  However desperately you may wish it were false, vote for because it is, in fact, a true statement of engineering and economic and geo-political fact.  And vote for because acknowledging reality is the essential first step in trying to change anything for the better.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Ill speak for the motion that Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.  Perhaps a natural reaction to that would be, what, are there still people who think its more important to save money, than to save the world?   Thats not our point.  Our point is, that we should really save the world, not just feel like were saving it.  Lets be clearglobal warming is real. Man-made, and increases by carbon emissions.  And global warming will harm future generations, especially the worlds poor.  But the brutal fact is, that even major carbon cuts at dramatic cost will make little impact on temperature, and do virtually nothing to help the world.  Still, my honored opponents will spend hundreds or even thousands of billions of dollars, to slightly reduce the impact of climate change 100 years from now, yet more than half the worlds population suffers from Medieval problems that we could fix right now, at much lower cost. This is nothing less than a moral tragedy for the developed world. Knowingly squandering colossal sums of money, achieving almost nothing, while fractional sums could save millions of lives right now.  Obvious as it may sound, our goal isnt for those of us in wealthy western world to feel good about ourselves, presumably, its about making sure we do the most good.   Today, 1 billion lack clean drinking water, 2 billion people lack sanitation, 3 billion people lack simple micronutrients, preventing physical and mental development.   One quarter of all the worlds deaths, are due to easily curable infectious diseases.  The equivalent of the population of Florida, wiped off the map, each year.  As an example, 1 million people die from malaria each year, and up to 2 billion people get the debilitating disease.  Yet, my esteemed opponents will focus on how global warming will cause a slight increase in malaria increase 100 years from now, and suggest that we should fix that through inefficient carbon cuts. But we could eradicate malaria right now, if we wanted, and at a lot lower cost.  That is the moral choice.  This pattern of little good at high cost, we find repeated in the cases by opponents will present to you.  And this is why all peer-reviewed economic valises show that simply cutting carbon is a poor way to help the world.  And thats exactly the crux of tonights debate.  That the best available economic evidence tells us that by focusing on cutting carbon emissions, were committing to an exceptionally inefficient way to tackle the symptoms of global warming, let alone global warming itself.  And given how much of our resources will be squandered in the process, the consequences are nothing less than a moral tragedy. Of course, my esteemed opponents will claim that without major carbon cuts, the world will be beyond saving.  Oliver Tickell has written that unabated global warming by the end of the century will be a catastrophe, and the beginning of the extinction of the human race because all the ice will melt and well see 200 feet of sea-level rise in the long term, wiping out pretty much everyone we hold dear, killing billions of people.  This doom-mongering is simply wrong.  Its inconsistent with everything we know.  And its important that people everywhere start to realize this.  Weve entrusted the UN Climate Panel, the so-called IPCC, with its thousands of scientists, to outline the most likely climate consequences.   They do not support Tickell, or any of the other, more alarmist writings of recent times.  What the IPCC does tell us is, yes, sea levels will rise, somewhere between six and 24 inches over the coming century. Such a rise is entirely manageable, and not dissimilar to the about 12 inches we barely noticed, have risen over the last 150 years.  Dramatic, expensive carbon cuts would make sea-level rise just a few inches less in 100 years.  Is this really the best we can do to help the world?   Of course, the obvious and easy thing to say is, well, we should do all good things, we should both make major carbon reductions, and combat malaria.  But this simply ignores the fact that we arent doing either very well.  We avoid the hard truth that the rich worlds focus is shifting daily towards global warming, with proportional less support seen for the real, and more tractable problems.   Its simply untruthful to claim that the focus on climate change doesnt mean theres less money going elsewhere.  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, is telling us that billions of dollars are being redirected to the fight, global warming, at the expense of the biggest killers of the poor countries. Any company or organization today that wants to be responsible, even just cool, will not be spending their cash on fighting tuberculosis, but wants to go carbon-neutral.  We must save the world, yes.  And heres how.   At The Copenhagen Consensus Project last year, a panel of the worlds most distinguished economists looked at a wealth of research of all the major problems in the world, and the possible solutions to them.  And they showed us where we can do the most good.   They agreed that global warmings real, and they were unanimous that the best way to tackle it is by investing much more in research and development in low carbon energy technologies.  The economists also found that carbon emission cuts, tonights motion, would be the poorest use of our money. They confirmed that we can do so much more good elsewhere, that we need to ease our preoccupation with cutting carbon, and focusing much more on fixing the real problems of the here and now.  This is about saving everyones world.   Not through ineffective and hugely costly carbon cuts, but through effective research and development, and low carbon energy sources, that anyway, will be the only long-term solution to the CO2 problem. And then remembering the major problems and challenges of this world.  Every single year and right now, a devastation is taking place in our world.  A dumb, readily avoidable devastation. Continuing mindlessly, and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in carbon cuts, is simply disgraceful, when it takes so little to do something about this devastation.  So, this is our chance.  Our chance not just to feel good about helping the planet, but actually to do the right thing, the rational thing, and the morally correct thing.  I commend this motion to you, do whats rational, not just whats fashionable.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Yeah, and clearly I think any economist would say that we need to actually make sure that the externality, the thing that you dont pay for, that you actually end up paying for it.  But you also have to have a realistic sense of it, and thats of course where we need to talk, not just about what works, and in particular, companies, but what actually works for the economy.   If you look across all the different studies, and Professor Richard Tol has done so, and its the latest and the only global survey of all the costs of what is an extra ton of CO2 causing of damage in the world, the answer is thats about $7 per ton of CO2.  That translates pretty much into 6 cents per gallon of gasoline.  So yes, we should have a carbon tax, thats not what actually gonna [sic] do anything majorly for or against our emissions.', 'Butbut, Hunter,  I love the loucheness of saying, oh, this is gonna be free, we are gonna make money off of this.  I love the fact that you want to reintroduce into the American public the idea of a profit-maximizing CEO.  I think thats a good idea.   But honestly, I think you already have that.  The point is, how are we gonna get beyond that, and that is gonna be costly and Europe has shown the way.  Its not costly', 'Yeah', 'Yeah, and that is what the UN is telling us that the cost is probably gonna be.  I mean, you have a discussion about is it gonna be 1, is it gonna be 3 percent, but its definitely gonna be hugely costly, and simply making these stories that some companies can make money, hey, great.   And presumably we dont have to do anything to make them make money.', 'But the real question is', 'where are we gonna get the rest of the cuts', 'Yep', 'Well', 'I just want us to bring us back to having a conversation and Hunter was actually very good at that.  We need to get back to business, this is not about who can come up with the smartest story or the most endearing cute little tale.  This is about how can we do this in the world.   And the economists have done those studies, and they have shown that this has real and significant costs, on the [UNCLEAR] of, you know, 1 to 3 or 4 percent of GDP.', 'The question is', 'do you want to spend that much money   Well, but the problem is, its not an investment if it doesnt actually pay back more and thats of course the whole question.  [APPLAUSE]  Are we doing a lot of good for the world', 'I love the fact that were being', 'Mm-hmm. FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER You stated that the Copenhagen Consensus favored technology, R-and-D investment.  However, isnt it true that the economists that you are so eagerly quoting as the great work that theyve done, have basically publicly distanced themselves from your interpretation of their work,  and Im talking about Richard Tol and Gary Yohe.  So basically, they say that they actually never looked at that, they looked at a climate-mix policy, which would have adaptation, mitigation, and R-and-D technology, which is the point that Oliver Tickell made.  Thank you', 'Sure.  Youve unfortunately read half of the discussion because its true, that they first made a comment in, in The Guardian and then later on, after wed had a long discussion on a blog, we actually, Yohe and I wrote a joint column, where we pointed out what it was we said.  Yes, Yohe, and to a certain extent Tol, believe that its also a good idea that we invest, and remember, it is mainly investing in research and development but also investing in carbon reductions right now.  There was another party, Professor Green, who made the argument that we should be investing much more in research and development and then only much later invest in cutting carbon emissions.   What came out of the Copenhagen Consensus where we had eight of the worlds top economists, including five Nobel laureates, looking at all that stuff, they said, well, if you look just in carbon reductions which is what we talk about here tonight, that probably pays less than $1 back on the dollar.  Whereas if we invest in research and development, it probably does $11 worth of good for every dollar. And thats the main reason', 'why were making this point', 'No, no, thats, and that', 'And this is the brilliant, and very, very good demonstration, that Oliver Tickell cant see anything that we shouldnt be spending money on and say lets spend money on it.  I would suggest that we should spend money  [LAUGHTER]', 'on things that give us $11 of good in the world, but we dont spend a dollar for every time we just get 90 cents back on', 'But Hunter, Hunter, the', 'But Hunter', 'Yeah', 'Hmm.', 'Yes', 'And the bottom line is, if Hunter is right, and everybody makes money off of this, cool, we can all go home, we dont need to worry about it because itll happen.', 'But the real question is', 'we know', 'No, no, Hunter, please let me', 'Right.', 'No.  The real point here is to say, are we gonna go further than that, and we know, and this is of course also what you accept, we know that the emissions scenarios expect dramatic increases in CO2, and what youre saying is, over and above all these great inventions that you describe and everybody else has been talking on the other side of the panel, over and above that, we have to cut dramatically.  Thats what costs money.  Thats the discussion that were having money.', 'Honestly, the real question is, is that worth it', 'And my question is still, are we spending trillions of dollars to do virtually no good a hundred years from now, Im sorry, Oliver, thats not actually', 'misrepresenting science.', '[OVERLAP]  Well, I love the way you think that  [SCATTERING OF APPLAUSE] Wal-Mart is actually gonna go and say, Oh, they produce a lot of carbon.  Lets call--lets buy stuff that costs a lot more from someone who dont produce as much carbon. Obviously,  [APPLAUSE, OVERLAP]  Wal-Mart can do that but I dont think theyll stay in business.  Let me also just point out two things.  I thought it was very rare to see that Adam was actually  Im not sure to what extent it was conscious, but he was actually agreeing with us, which is really nice.  You should come over here.  He was basically saying, China is going to go and emit much, much more.  Then theyre gonna be careful and they care a lot about air pollution.  And thats absolutely true. Then he sort of slipped in, and theyre gonna cut carbon emissions.  Uh, no, of course not.  Theyre gonna put scrubbers on their coal plants, which is really smart.  But theyre not gonna care about their carbon emissions for a long term.  And I would just like, the last point also  do you remember how Hunter told us about the first Chinese billionaire is a guy who produces solar panels?  Do you know who he sells those solar panels to?  He sells them to Germany.  Theyve actually bought a hundred and fifty-six billion dollars worth of solar panels.  Do you know how much good thats gonna do?  By the end of this century that will postpone global warming by one hour.  [AUDIENCE RESPONSE]', '[OVERLAP]  Im simply asking you, is that the way we want to help the world?  [APPLAUSE]', '[OVERLAP]  No.', '[OVERLAP, UNCLEAR]', '[OVERLAP, [UNCLEAR]', '[OVERLAP]  The basic problem  Sorry.', '[OVERLAP] I find it a little bizarre to refer to a study in the 1950s that show that we could actually have done this cheaply but we just failed to do so.  Maybe thats because its very, very hard and actually very costly.  And that is, unfortunately -- Im sorry, Hunter  what all the global cost benefit in...analyses show.  But let me just point out to Oliver  because he very eloquently put how we should invest in all this and this is a great deal.  Notice what Germany has done.  Its spent a hundred and fifty-six billion dollars on buying very inefficient solar technology.  The thing I dont understand is why didnt they just invest one/tenth of that in actually making solar panels much better?  That would have really made a difference and that would have made it easier for the Chinese and everybody else to get solar panels cheaper, faster.', '[OVERLAP]  And the other thing I want to point out is just, its terrible ', '[OVERLAP]  Let, let me just finish.', 'The other thing is that its terrible to say this is gonna help --', 'Yeah.', '[OVERLAP]  No, the  And ', '[OVERLAP]  No, no.  The International Energy Agency has actually shown that the investment in renewables have gone down, not up, globally.  And Im sorry, thats because we are so focused on cutting carbon emissions that everybody worries about how we can get through the next five years, not how were gonna get through the next fifty [UNCLEAR]', 'Again, we need to get a sense of proportion.  A lot of people are trying to sell you, Oh, we can move to renewables.  We can do a lot of great things.  Lets just remember that the International Energy Agency, as you just mentioned, estimate that right now we use about half of one percent of our energy comes from real renewables like wind and solar and geo-thermal.  If we dont do anything by 2030 itll be up to one point seven percent.  But if we really strive, if we really do everything that all those people, over here on this side wants us to do we might be able to  the International Energy Agency estimates  to squeeze it up to two point eight percent.  Im sorry, thats just not gonna make a big difference in this world.  And thats, of course, the real crucial point.', 'But the point is...', '[OVERLAP]  But there was a report in 1950 that said we could do it now.  I mean, how can you keep on making these sorts of comparisons?  [AUDIENCE REACTION]', 'Thank you.  Its a little depressing to see that I started out telling you that we were gonna hear two arguments.  And indeed we have heard them.  One is that this is gonna be the end of the world and therefore we need to do whatever Oliver says.  Im not really sure thats such a great argument.  I would simply say we know from the U.N. Climate Panel that global warming will cause problems but it will not by any means be the end of the world.  It is one of the many problems we need to tackle and thats exactly why were having this debate -- exactly asking, Is this worth the money or should we indeed do other things?  And thats, of course, the other slightly sad thing, that its a false choice.  We can do everything but we dont.  And so my question to you is really very, very simply, How do you want to be remembered?  Al Gore actually points this out very well.  He says, This is our generational mission.  He asks you, How do you want to be remembered by your kids and your grandkids?  I find it stunning that he would actually make that argument because the real question is, Do you want to be remembered for having spent hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars to do virtually no good a hundred years from now? Or do you want to be remembered for actually having solved all the major problems that half of this worlds population suffers -- these medieval, terrible tragedies that we are watching right now? This is really about how you want to be remembered.  And I hope you want to be remembered by doing a lot of good rather than just a little bit.  Thats what tonights decision is about.  Thats the tradeoff.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Thank you, John.  [APPLAUSE]  Adam and colleagues, I really wish I could believe that we can manage the costs that would control climate.  Very sadly, I have to quote Samuel Johnson, the great British lexicographer.  An obstinate stubbornness, a rationality, stops me believing it.   And with a twinkle in my eye, because were in New York and near Wall Street, what I want to show, very dangerously, is that, climate science and these costs are sub-prime sciencesub-prime economics, [APPLAUSE] and above all, sub-prime politics.   And they will cost us dear, despite what Adam and Oliver and Hunter will be saying.  And weve got to be very, very careful.  And Bjorn used a very important phrase. Lets not just follow whats fashionable.  In fact, Johnson again had a wonderful phrase for it.  Lets not be befuddled, by the clamor of the times.  [APPLAUSE] Let me therefore start, by science, Im not going to say much on science because, I agree with what Robert said, right at the start in this.  Its actually not very much about the science, its always been about economic and political choice.  Everything is when it comes down to it, like it or not.   But I just want you to have one image, and its a very serious scientific image, I want you to think of the worldI want you to think of the world from inner Siberia, to Greenland, then to Singapore, and then come to the Arab states and to Sahara.   What, ladies and gentlemen, is the temperature range I have just covered.  It is from minus 20 degrees C, to nearly 50 degrees C, a range of 70 degrees C, in which humanity has adapted and learnt to live.  [APPLAUSE]  We are talking about, ignoring the extremes that Oliver said, a prediction of 2 to 3 degrees C, what a funk!  [LAUGHTER, [APPLAUSE] Im very serious, what a funk!  Humanity lives successfully from Greenland to Singapore to Saudi Arabia.  70 degrees C.  And what is more, the carbon reductions will not produce an outcome that is predictable.  Climate is the most complex, coupled, non- linear, chaotic system known to man.   Of course there are human influences in it, nobody denies that.  But what outcome will they get, by fiddling with one variable at the margins.  Im sorry, its scientific nonsense.  And a very serious nonsense. [APPLAUSE]  But its the economics above all, because thats the motion, the costs.   I come from the left wing politically.  I am fed up with environmentalists putting regressive costs and taxes on the poor.  [APPLAUSE]  It always costs more in the end, whatever Adam and the other say, and its always fundamentally on the poor. Theyve forgotten the famous Jevons Paradox, Professor Jevons from my own country, University College, London, that actually when you save on energy, you dont really save, you simply transfer it to new energy costs, and actually probably issue more CO2.   So when you save energy you take another holiday, you take another flight, your CO2 increases.  And he demonstrated that in the 19th century.  Have we forgotten this basic economics. But above all, its this.  Im going to be honest about this, I dont trust the environmentalist agenda.  For 30 to 40 years, what they have fundamentally been wanting to do, is place an infinity in cost-benefit.   In other words, so that the rationality of economic choices is undermined by effectively a religious choice, not an economic choice.  [APPLAUSE]  Under an infinity of course, choice is not made under the procedures that were put down by Peter, and by Bjorn.  But it wont work. And that leads me, it becomes a closed system of thought, and that always worries me deeply.  But its the politics then, finally, sub-prime politics.  We are full of eco-poseurs and in the United States you have some gems.  [LAUGHTER]  I dont think I need to mention them.   But what weve got to remember is that, this motion is about the cost of artificially in a sense, forcing down the carbon.  Energy security, efficiency, are [UNCLEAR] of course theyre absolutely vital.  Energy security will become of the major themesof the Obama administration, and rightly so, but that isnt artificially forcing down carbon.   And exactly as Peter said, only this week, China announced a 30 percent increase by 2015, in its coal production.  Actually announced that only this week. And in a sense, we are not being realistic.  As I said I would love to be able to think we can control climate, when of course it is indeed going to have to be adaptation, flexibility put to an outcome that we dont know cause I actually dont know what climate, theyre wanting to produce for us.  And actually I dont think they know either.  [APPLAUSE] But let me come back to Johnson again, cause Johnson said everythingBible, Shakespeare and Johnson, youve got it. [LAUGHTER]  And Johnson said virtually everything.  In a very, very brilliant book that he wrote in the 18th century there called Rasselas, he talks of an astronomer who claims that he can control climate.   This is what he says.  The sun has listened to my dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction. The clouds at my call, have poured their waters.  And what does Johnson say about this astronomerastronomer?  He was mad! And so are we, if we actually believe we can control climate predictably, the costs in every sense will be enormous.  Oh, mamma mia.  We are the dancing queens.  Lets give this global warming nonsense, its Waterloo tonight.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE, SOME BOOING]', 'Oh', 'Youyoure never going to stop climate change, can we just kill one thing off.  Climate will change without us or with us.  And thats where Bjorn is right.  [APPLAUSE]  BjornBjorn is right because always its going to have to aid adaptation.  If in any way we impoverish ourselves so we cannot help the developing world, that would indeed be a moral mistake of mammoth proportions', 'Oliver, were not disagreeing with you on that', 'But Oliver', 'Nobody on this panel, nobody on this panel is against increasing energy efficiency and energy security, its the most sensible thing of all.  But if youre making the marker of it, always what is precisely happening to carbon, A, youre not gonna do it, and Im sorry to say youre not actually going to do it for a reason Ill just mention in a second,  but also, yourethe real issue is how are we going to have enough energy of all types, not just to keep the US going, but above all from my point of view, for the developing world.  That is to me absolutely crucial', 'With energy', 'But Hunter, what about the impact [APPLAUSE] of biofuel development for this, on the need, even greater need to increase world food supply.  Youre taking land now increasingly for biofuels to increase world food supply, it is a competitive choice', 'No', 'No.  No', 'You are subsidizing it, but, in fact the seriousness all the way through from Malaysia for example to Indonesia et cetera, the impact is potential, in fact some people argue, it is now one of the most serious pressures causing in fact reduction in world food supply.', 'at a time, when we have to', 'John, could we just answer the word major, which seemed to be the really', 'serious question that the lady here asked.  If Im being quite honest about major, to influence climate in any way, you fundamentally would have to throw 4 billion people out of work. Youd have to keep every ounce of coal in the ground, every ounce of oil in the ground, and lets be absolutely frank, it isnt going to happen.  [APPLAUSE]   Because, the impact of anything less from changing your light bulbs to biofuels, is absolutely nonexistent on climate, and thats my point.  If it were truly worth doing, the costs would be right.  But it wont work on climate.', 'No [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'I didnt', 'No, no, no, I didnt', 'Yeah, John, one of the great things about the Rosenkranz Foundation debates is precisely that they assume that each side respects the position of the other, and one of the great things about this debate is that Im hearing all these arguments, I actually am happy to respect the position, and in fact one of the terrible things that has happened recently,  is the attempt to close down debate, and in fact to attack people, [APPLAUSE] with the use of extremely unnot my colleagues here, extremely unpleasant language.  It is absolutely that debate is vital on a topic like this, its vigorous of course, Hunter and I are gonna go at each other.   But I respect her position absolutely, and not one of us denies the influence of humans on climate change', 'Global warming costs', 'Cost nonsense, very different', 'No, global warming costs', 'Yes, absolutely.', 'No', 'Ab  You see, that is what I absolutely', 'am unhappy with.  I', 'You are telling me Im denying it', '[UNCLEAR] Im not', 'In The New Yorker last week', 'In The New Yorker last week, your own magazine, a very liberal magazine and one I love, very interestingly, there was a fascinating statement, which that, you cant effectively do dual or multi-instruments politically, to answer say both poverty and climate change, and theI love the analogy that was given by the professor quoted, it was a very good one.  I might wish to save energy and Ive invited you all round for dinner, be very nice to meet you all [LAUGHS] for dinner, but in fact, Im going to cook my pizzas and all the rest of it, in the shower so Im going to save energy.   Of course youre going to end up with a very, very rotten dinner, and I think this is at the heart of what were discussing here, how far do  [LAUGHTER]  How far do dual instruments and multi-instruments actually work, and I think, its when I do passionately disagree with Oliver on this.   Because, lets be honest, in our own households and everything, we have a given income, we have to make very, very difficult choices.  If I know what I would put my choices by the way, very simply, and they would tie in, not because Im supporting Bjorn particularly on this because theyI came to this decision a long I am very worried indeed about the whole state of the development of new viruses in the world at the moment, they are all very serious problems.  And if you look historically, the single biggest effects that have created deaths amongst humanity, have been the evolution of new viruses, new bacteria, and new forms.  And thats the crucial point.  Across the', 'No.  [LAUGHTER]  No, its', 'Its not irrelevant, not irrelevant [OVERLAPPING VOICES, APPLAUSE]', 'They have just announced that theyre going to increase', 'theyve just announced', 'their official spokesman', 'Yes', 'Yeah I have, but just, its crucial this, that China has just announced a 30 percent increase.  Theyve just announced it.', 'Absolutely', \"Well, I don't want to talk about  Let me just mention briefly Europe.  An absolute failure under the Kyoto Protocol.  Talks a lot, have not [UNCLEAR]\", 'No.  What were debating is the effectiveness of major cost. Europe  MAN [OVERLAP, [UNCLEAR] PHILIP STOTT ...has failed utterly, for economic and political reasons, to cut. Some of the figures -- from Spain, from Italy, from Ireland -- are just mind blowing.  And this is what I just, were in a cloud, cuckoo land here.  And let me just make a point about this. Were worried about China, yet worry about the E.U. now on this. Half the E.U. now is opposing the E.U.s policy on cutting carbon. Listen to the Czech President, for example.  Thats Vaclav Klaus, who is the current President of the E.U.  Why do you think the recent E.U. policies have collapsed virtually?  Dont think Europe, dont think its just China or India.  Dont take the, what Europe says.  Europe talks but its not walking the walk. MAN [OVERLAP]  So under [UNCLEAR]', '[OVERLAP]  Germany has the biggest brown coal plants in the world.', 'Theyre the single most polluting coal plants.', \"Its a very fine question.  Thank you for the peak oil question. Because, of course, were obsessed with oil, but of course, there's gas and above all, as Peter has emphasized, coal.  And it all depends on price again.  Just remember how the dreaded state, the apartheid state of South Africa, actually survived the European, um, uh, embargoes, for example.  It was, of course, by turning coal into oil.  And there are vast coal reserves.  When we, were obsessed with the oil, but in fact, you have to take the whole of, of, of the group before you even question that.  So look at the whole package, not just oil.\", '[OVERLAP]  If you included nuclear in renewables the figures change.', '[OVERLAP]  Theres a lot of  Yes, you do.  And a lot of environmentalists dont.', 'The only way Britain will make its [UNCLEAR]  is very, very simple, as all the governments have known  and Tony Blair knew extremely well  is that if we do not have a new generation of nuclear [UNCLEAR]  theres absolutely no way we shall meet anything like a renewable target.', 'Adam quoted a very great American.  Id like also to relate to a northeastern great American  in fact, the very founder of the American ecological movement  George Perkins Marsh of Vermont, who wrote Men and Nature in 1864, one of the greatest books ever written.  And Professor David Lowenthal, also a great American author of the day, wrote something about him, which is extremely important for us to hear in the case of this debate. Environmental reformers who find natures inarticulate indifference unbearable impute their own aims to nature and then purport to speak on natures behalf.  A rarified natural world is then worshiped as virtuous.  And Marsh himself said, The equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a problem for human intelligence to solve.  I think there was a mighty humility in Marshs view of nature, which actually weve forgotten today, which is vital.  Cause what I am interested in is outcomes.  Will it work?  Remember the motion is major cuts. Im really serious about this.  We agree on the influence that climate change will have impacts on people.  Of course it will. But what is really in the end going to work?  Its got to work. Thats why Peters realism is absolutely essential to all this.  And back to Johnson to end.  He said, Why, sir, most schemes of political improvement are very laughable things, he said  which I think is an important way of always looking at it.  But finally, the limits of all that were doing here  also Johnson.  How small of all that human hearts endure that part which laws or kings or senates or congresses  Ive added those --  can cause or cure.  In the end we want to solve this because we think its us.  Im afraid its nature, greater than us, and we cant in the end manage it as we wish we would.  Thank you.']\n",

      "['Well ladies and gentlemen, I just heard a wonderful suggestion, Barack Obama is going to be the second-worst President since the war.  [LAUGHTER]  The only thing I think that might make you, or many of you at least, not agree that George Bush is the worst American President of 50 years, is to hear somebody say it in a British accent.  [LAUGHTER]  Im acutely aware of the sensitivity of international comment.  I am a deep skeptic about my own government, and I will not say much good of Gordon Brown, I wont say a lot of good about hereditary monarchy.  But if I hear someone with an American accent insult my Queen Ill hit them.  [LAUGHTER] There is something about foreign accents on these subjects, that gets peoples backs up, so I beg your pardon.  The point I want to make is this.  That there are really two American Presidents. Theres a President of the United States of America, and that is entirely your business.   But theres a second American President.  And he is the President of the Western Alliance, and in many senses since the end of the Cold War, is seen as a sort of President of the rest of the world.  Ive just been in Syria and Lebanon.  A lady speaking at a meeting made a rather moving remark.   She said every single one of us round the world, went to the polls on November the 4th, but only some of us were let in. The vast majority disenfranchised, sat outside, while America decided on their economy, on their diplomacy, on their politics, in many cases on their lives. And its to that American President that I want to say a few words tonight.  Ive spent almost all my life cheerleading for America. Im second to nobody in this noble cause.  And I can tell you its not been easy this past eight years.  But until the last eight years, I have always felt, that each American President, in some small sense, pushed uphill the great boulder of democratic freedom.   Every single one, I felt at the end of it, yeah, Americas done it again.  Weve made a bit of progress.  I felt that was one of the great strengths of America, that it could push that boulder a bit uphill.  It may have been a military intervention, it may have been a trade agreement, may have been a single example. Whatever it was, somehow or other, there was progress forward with what I call the great American crusade.  When George Bush came to power I was rather in favor of him.  I rather admired the program he put forth with this foreign policy.   Condoleezza Rices famous article on a humble foreign policy, definitely appealed to me.  I liked the remark about America setting the world an example by what it did at home, rather than by getting the 82nd Airborne to lead kids to school.   This seemed to me to be a refreshing, unbombastic, unostentatious diplomacy.  Then came 9-11.  And Ive always remembered those few weeks after 9-11, when the whole world was pro-American.  Yasir Arafat gave blood for New Yorkers.  Many people forget that.   Almost nobody, almost nobody, was not on Americas side for those two or three weeks.  And the disaster that followed, going to war intrue retaliation for it, is something from which I dont think American policy has ever recovered. Ive recently been touring around that arc of instability, and the consequences of the consequences of 9-11 really have been catastrophic.  To pretend that Iraq is a success is obscene.  Iraq today is more or less back to what it was like in 2004 and if Karl or Bill want to walk hand in hand with me down Haifa Street in Baghdad, as you could still in 2004, well, I can tell you they wont.   Afghanistan is heading in exactly the same direction, I think Afghanistans going to be a far worse mistake than Iraq. But in every single theater that you look, with the possible exception of Japan which had been eccentrically mentioned, you will see what I can only describe as the wrong decisions taken. Iran should not be a [UNCLEAR] at the moment, it should much more like Egypt, and it couldve been.  Theres no reason for undermining the Pakistan government to the extent it has been undermined by American military intervention there. Russia, a putative friend eight years ago, is now a serious menace. Wherever you look, you see what I call the crashes down the road of neoconservatism, littering the highway of world affairs.  This was unnecessary, it was not required by circumstance, it was choice, it was decisions made in Washington.   Now those of us who feel very strongly about America, always regarded the basis on which America operated out of its area, America went abroad to do things, was that it had a sort of moral superiority.  There was behind what it did, a backbone.  And that backbone was the backbone on which those people who approved of American intervention abroad always relied on. Im afraid under the leadership of the last eight years, that backbone has snapped.  It has been simply impossible to tell countries elsewhere in the world that the American example, that the American intention, that the American execution of its intervention has been for the best.  People just dont see it that way.  If you go round many of these countries today, and I mean today, you see the most extraordinary faith put in the next [WARNING TONE] American President', 'If you go round the world today, you will find the most extraordinary faith in the person youve elected as your next President.  I have never come across anything like it.  A totally nave belief, that this is the messiah, Barack Obama, has come to save not you, but everybody.   He will solve the Middle East.  He will get out of Iraq, hell get out of Afghanistan, hell pacify Pakistan, hell make friends with Iran.  Ludicrous expectations are placed on the shoulders of this man.  The reason why thats happened is because people simply have despaired over the last eight years.   The reason why, I think, unrealistic but possibly disastrous expectations are made of Barack Obama, is that, George Bush, for better or for worse, George Bush, has caused such a catastrophe in so many countries around the world.  I congratulate you on voting for Obama, I hope you will vote for this motion, thank you. [APPLAUSE]', \"Well, I think the origin of this whole part of the discussion is the response to 9/11.  9/11 is the starting point of almost everything that weve been talking about.  And I think many people in Europe, and around the world, simply feel that America over- reacted, and so did Britain, I may say.  So, this is not something peculiar to America.  It was a feeling that some new force had been unleashed on the world to which we had to respond by restricting our normal customary defenses and liberty.  I'm a libertarian, and I feel that was, Ive always felt that was simply unnecessary, the reaction was an overreaction.  The consequence of it, however, is that we have, in a sense, played the terrorists game.  Weve done what they wanted us to do, which was restrict our liberties, curb our liberties, behave in a certain way towards other States and other peoples that we would not normally have done before.  And\", 'Would that they were on the run.', 'What I think is extraordinary to people abroad, is that those of us who are enthusiasts for America and American liberties cannot see why you needed to do these things.  You will never persuade the outside world that you have not restricted liberty in America. You will never persuade them that you have not taken out Muslims as a particular group, and you will never, and you never persuade them that you really needed to do these things.', 'Because', 'Arrested them.', 'Incarcerated them without trial.', 'The, [UNCLEAR]  belabor me all day with lists of people who have vanished.  Vanished.', \"But you didn't need to do it, you didn't need to do it\", \"You didn't need Guantanamo Bay.\", 'Youve got the world believing America is a less robust place, and it really is.', 'You', 'No.', 'Yeah, yeah.', 'Its just not true.', 'We have a problem here.  I just dont see terrorism as a state projected force in the way that you do.  I regard it in the sense that the question was trying to ask before, as a criminal act of gangsters roaming the world, and badly in need of curtailing by their own governments.  I think the way we treated international terrorism is to glorify it, to give it the status of a state.  Weve given huge recruiting energy to those people who want to bring young people into this particular odious fold, and I think by declaring war on some governments, I may say not all governments that harbor them, weve accorded them a status wholly beyond what they deserve.  I believe that my country and your countrys overstated this threat.  I just think weve overdone it.  And in overdoing it, we turned very large numbers of countries in the, particularly in the Islamic world, into state menaces.  They themselves are undermined by the status weve given to these people.  Pakistan being a classic case of that.  This is quite a cosmic question.  If you declare a very small group of people to be an international menace, you turn them into a sort of hero, and weve done that, and its been a terrible, terrible mistake.', 'When I was a very young journalist, was in Vietnam at the very end of that war, and attended the relevant briefings, and this is not aa very well-informed comment but, my view was that the Vietnam war and occupation of South Vietnam, was far more competently executed than the occupation of Iraq.   The occupation of Iraq, was, and I followed American and British occupation troops around the world for most of my careerthe occupation of Iraq was simply the most incompetent thing Ive ever seen.  It was stupefyingly incompetent  [APPLAUSE]  And Ive no doubt at all that many people possibly on the platform wouldnt disagree with that, because it was conducted by a very small group of people, against the advice of a much larger group of people within the administration.   It simply has been a catastrophe.  Afghanistan is much better conducted, although I think its a much more difficult war to fight.  And thats why I think its gonna end in greater tears than Iraq will end, Iraq is fairly simple to end, you just leave.   Itll be very, very difficult to leave Afghanistan.  But certainly in Vietnam, I think you had on the whole relatively competent military people there, they had experience in Korea many of them.  They lost but they only just lost.  I do think that America couldve stabilized South Vietnam had it stayed longer.  It was not the right place to be and the right thing to do, but it was not a hopeless case.  I think when you go into a country without a good reason, or with the purpose of simply punishing the country as was the case in both Iraq and Afghanistan, youre not likely to do well, because you havent really plotted what the purpose of the exercise is, it was simply to punish.   And I think its that punitive element thats been the problem, certainly in Iraq.  And I am sorry Ive been there only twice, but I cannot accept that it is in any sense of the word a success.', 'I imagine the reason why thereve been no more attacks in America or in Britain or in most of Europe, is because of good policing on the ground, not because youve been at war in the Middle East.  I believe in good policing, I think the Kyoto terrorism, whatever that precisely may mean, people blowing people up, is essentially front-line policing.    Good intelligence, good espionage, good work on the ground.  Its not by going to war against other states.  But the phrase Islamo-fascism, so easily bandied about from this side of the Atlantic, and I may say from Europe, when you travel in these countries the relentlessness of the assumption that every Arab, every Muslim is a crypto-Islamo-fascist.   And the evidence you give of it, by going in and invading some of their countries, is the surest possible way to turn them into hostile  [APPLAUSE]  I cannot emphasize enough', 'these are normal people, by and large.  Theyre people quite like you.  They dont think, most of them, that they have a right to come and invade your country, close down Guantanamo Bay, do all the things they think youre doing wrong.   There is now an assumption on the part of both your country and my country under Tony Blair, that we have in some sense a right to go and sort out their countries, because theyre not like our countries. This must be one of the great fallacies of the modern age.  I hope Obama overcomes it.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, I think that, good relations with a country, are more likely to get that country to suppress those elements within the country that are inclined to terrorism than bad relations with the country, that has to be true.  [APPLAUSE]', 'What was this ricin attack in Britain.', 'Milk powder, milk powder.', \"Well, I repeat my view at the very beginning.  I'm not here to be rude about an American President.  I would just point out about Iraq, you cannot say somethings a success when I saw last week two million Iraqis are camped outside Damascus because they haven't got the nerve to go home to their homeland because the Americans are there.  [APPLAUSE]  Two thirds of all the Christians in Iraq have been driven out of that country under Americas aegis.  Fundamentalism is far more rife in southern Iraq than it ever was under Saddam Hussein.  Lets just get some facts here.  However, let me come back to the original point, I had great respect for Bush when he came to power.  I liked his courtesy, I liked his moderation, and I liked his concept of humility in Americas power projection.   I think, tragically, after 9/11 he allowed the politics of fear to get the better of him, he persuaded my Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to let the politics of fear aid his re-election campaign as well.  The politics of fear is the most corrosive of all forms of politics in a democracy.  Power, and America remains [APPLAUSE]  remains a hugely powerful country, power has an obligation of restraint.   If you're the most powerful country in the world, your obligation is not to go over the top, to charge around the world invading countries on the feeblest of pretexts, your obligation is to show restraint.  My America was always a country of huge self confidence, belief in its ability to resist attack of any sort, and not needing to erode its own freedoms and those of other people in order to achieve that defense of democracy.   I personally think that youve just elected a man who I have found, from when I first read his book, a truly remarkable figure, on whom I think it is right to place great expectations.  And, but, he has got to recover from a terrible legacy in the world, outside America.  I still believe he will.  I think you have a terrific future ahead of you, but you have been through an awful eight years.  Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]\"]\n",
      "['If you need more time Im afraid I cant help you.  Id like to thank Bob Rosenkranz and Intelligence Squared.  I feel like Ive spent most of the past year watching Presidential debates, its nice to finally be in one.  Please dont change your minds, Bush was obviously the worst President of the past 50 years.   Yet the task Simon and I have tonight is extremely difficult.  We have to convince a small fraction of you, at least if youre anything like the people who have given Bush the lowest approval rating of any post-war President, who still resist that conclusion.   And to be honest Im not sure that people who still defend the Bush Presidency are entirely open to persuasion.  But I wanna try, by talking a little about how much Bush has done wrong and how little hes done right.  Let me first just tell you a little bit about my own perspective on this, I am not a Bush hater.  Im not someone who can be described as a partisan Democrat, the way Mr. Kristol and Mr. Rove are partisan Republicans. Im a centrist liberal, Im fairly hawkish on security issues, Im in favor of limited government.  And let me just state up front, I think George W. Bush was a fine governor of Texas.  I think Ronald Reagan was a successful President, and I think George H. W. Bush, 41, understood foreign policy better than all but a few Presidents in the post-war era.   About two years ago, I started writing a book about the Bush Presidency.  And I was gonna spend a lot of time on Bushs successes and accomplishments. And Ill admit that I wanted to do that not just to be fair, but so I would look fair.  And, I looked for the successes and accomplishments, and I looked, and I looked, and I came back totally empty-handed.   There were a number of areas where I expected to stick up for Bush, but I really found it impossible. For example, I was sympathetic to his approach to education reform.  But even from a conservative perspective, Bush didnt allow provide enough resources to allow for any real mobility or choice in public schools. Instead of national standards which we needed he let the states write their own tests.  Thats what the conservative base wanted. They dont believe the federal government should be involved in education at all, and in caving in to them Bush ensured that hed make little meaningful progress on education and in fact, he has made very little meaningful progress.  I thought Bush was right about the need for immigration reform.  And then I watched him surrender to the xenophobes and nativists in his own party.  I thought Bush was right to spend a lot of money fighting AIDS in Africa.  And then I watched him save far fewer lives than he might have, because of religious extremists, again in his own party, who believe abstinence propagandas more effective than condoms.  I thought Bush was right about free trade, and then I watched his lack of leadership lead to the collapse of the most important item on the global trade agenda, the Doha development route. So, those are the partial successes.  I cant hope to cover all Bushs failures tonight.  What would be a top failure for a President doesnt even really make his top five.  [LAUGHTER] So, never mind his incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina, it doesnt make the cut.   Never mind his denial of climate change and eight lost years on global warming, that doesnt make the cut either.  Im just going to give you my top five.  Number one is the invasion of Iraq.   This was the most important decision of the Bush Presidency and he made it on the basis, as I think we all know, of the false premise that Saddam Hussein was threatening America with weapons of mass destruction, and consorting with al-Qaeda.   Now Im not someone who believes that Bush deliberately falsified the evidence.  But I believe he was totally uninterested in the evidence.  This war would never have been fought, if Bush had been interested in the truth as opposed to finding a pretext for something he wanted to do. I think his second biggest failure is the mismanaged occupation of Iraq.  Bush refused for more than three years to change a failed military strategy.  And almost the whole time people like my friend Mr. Kristol here were desperately insisting, rightly in my view, that Bush needed to move to a counterinsurgency strategy.  Bush said, essentially, dont bother me with the details. He delegated the strategy to Rumsfeld and he ignored the failure. I think the surge has helped tremendously in Iraq, the outrage is that Bush moved to it in 2007, not in 2003 or 2004.  His third biggest failure is undermining Constitutional rights, and American ideals.  Now I cant go into detail here about all the ways he abused his authority, and disregarded the rights of both foreigners and American citizens. But he and Vice President Cheney opened the door to torture, which led directly to the horrors of Abu Ghraib.  He effectively suspended habeas corpus, holding suspects for years without charge or trail, and he took a perverse view of his office, claiming that virtually limitless executive authority was part of the inherent power of the Presidency.  His fourth failure was sabotaging American unity after September 11th.  The day after the attacks, the front page of La Monde in Paris said We are all Americans.  The whole world was with us.  But Mr. Bush and Mr. Rove saw September 11th as a political opportunity for what Spiro Agnew called, positive polarization.   Now Simon is gonna speak to the harm, that this did to Americas image in the world. But I would just say, with a new administration coming into office, never in more than 200 years of our history has restoring Americas around the world been such an urgent project for a new President. Number five, my last, is Bushs catastrophic economic mismanagement, which is so current we hardly even need to spell it out.  It remains to be seen whether were facing a depression, whether Bush will stand in for Herbert Hoover.   But I think its clear that were living through the direct result of an ideological refusal to sensibly regulate financial markets.  Bush says hes sorry about all the lost jobs, if you saw his interview on ABC last night.   But, as he loses his, the interesting question is whether he ever understood [WARNING TONE], or understood now, his own contribution.  Now our opponents this evening, may try to argue that Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter was worse.   But neither of those Presidents failed as badly as Bush.  Carter had the Camp David agreement, and despite Watergate, Nixon left historic accomplishments including opening relations with China, and creating the Environmental Protection Agency. Neither of them rivals Bush for sheer, all-pervading incompetence.  [LAUGHTER]  But if our opponents tonight Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Im closing here, if our opponents tonight wish to argue that Bush was only the second worst President of the last 50 years, thats not much of a defense.  This national nightmare, I would suggest, has been the deepest and longest of all. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well I disagree with that.  Every president until, through Bushs father, had to manage the Cold War which was infinitely more threatening to the existence of civilization than September 11th was.  And in particular, if you want a particularly specific example, John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis, which probably brought us closer to Armageddon than weve ever been. And the way Kennedy personally managed that crisis, if youve ever seen the movie Thirteen Days, or listened to any of the tapes, is an amazing story, because he rejected the advice of very powerful people in his administration who claimed to know a lot more than he did.  But his instincts were very good, and he made the decision that saved us all.', 'One second', 'Jack Goldsmith was drummed out of the Bush administration for challenging those decisions', 'He was not', 'But if you', \"If you read Goldsmiths book he was driven out, more or less. But the point is you--I'm amazed by--I appreciate how open minded you are about some of these issues.  But on the civil liberties issues, you're amazingly cavalier.  Closing Guantanamo is no big deal, we have them here, we have them there.  Torture, you won't second guess the decisions.   I mean, these go to the heart of the questions about the rule of law and the Constitution, and the question of whether terror suspects [APPLAUSE]\", 'The question', 'The question', \"Why can't you deal with them with military trials?  We have an existing\", 'No, he set up his own alternate system.  We already had a system of military justice', 'He decided he needed his own', \"Not at all, and people have far fewer rights under the military system.  But the point is, under your system, they have no rights. The prisoners at Guantanamo were originally denied access to a lawyer, we couldn't even find out who was there, and the original claim by the Bush administration was that this applied to citizens as well as non-citizens.  So, if the Bush administration decided that you were suspected of terrorism, you could be held indefinitely without a lawyer, without a hearing, without a trial.\", \"I'm not saying that these\", 'But heres what you slipped in, if we picked up someone whos a terrorist.  What if they happen not to be a terrorist?  Some of these people have been acquitted.  [APPLAUSE]', \"No, that's exactly right.\", \"I'm, I'm\", 'Hang on, hang on here.', \"Can we just, one more word on this, because if you read Richard Clarkes book, or some of the other inside accounts of this, its clear, its not that nobody had heard of al Qaeda, Richard Clarke, for example, was running around with his hair on fire about how dangerous this threat was.   And its clear that Bush, in the early days, downplayed it, rejected it, didn't take it seriously, and did so because it had been a particular focus of the Clinton administration, and he was reversing policy.  [APPLAUSE]\", 'Well they [APPLAUSE]', 'They launched missile strikes', 'on Osama bin Laden', 'They missed.  Bush hasnt got him either.  They started a little later.  Anyway', \"Mr. Rove mentioned somewhere in that incredible litany of distortions that [LAUGHTER]  that I was in favor of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.  I was, as were a lot of sensible people.  I didn't happen to favor doing it the way Bush did, largely unilaterally, rejecting allies, as opposed to building pressure on Saddam, and not waiting for the inspection process to play out. But I think the point is, and what weve subsequently learned, and the problem I had that Bush didn't have, was I did not have access to analysts from the Department of Energy trying to tell everybody that those aluminum tubes were not for nuclear weapons.  But the point is that Saddam was being, had been successfully disarmed, and was being successfully contained, and he was not supporting international terrorism, because he was afraid to.  He was a miscalculator, a serial miscalculator, but he was not a mad man, and I think he understood very clearly that supporting terrorism against the United States would have resulted in the same thing that happened anyway, his destruction.  I think what would have happened if we didn't invade Iran, Id actually like to turn the question around a little bit and ask Bill Kristol, for example, does he, knowing what we know now, still think invading Iraq would make sense? But I think that we might have ended up having to take military action against Saddam Hussein at some point in the future.  But I think we could have done it with allies, I think we could have done it in a more thought out way, and I think we could have planned for an occupation, it could have been expected if we knew we were going to have to do it. [APPLAUSE]\", 'Just on a  [APPLAUSE]  Sorry to step on your well-deserved applause, Simon.  The just on LBJ, the questioner asked what courageous thing did he ever do, just for starters, how about saying goodbye to the South for the Democratic Party for generations, [APPLAUSE] when he signed the Civil Rights Act in 64 and the Voting Rights Act in 65.   Johnson knew that would be the political consequence of that decision and he did it anyway, to me thats almost the definition of political courage. On judgement however I dont think Johnson does so well in Vietnam and its quite comparable to Bush, I think  I think both of them were very poorI think both of them were essentially unable to admit error, to recognize error, and to reverse error.  And, whereas Johnson a slightly different story, and you know, you get into sort of psychological territory here but, Johnson clearly didnt trust Kennedys advisors.  He had this longstanding issue with the Kennedy brothers and I think he was getting some good advice from some of the Kennedy people, but I think he couldnt hear it because of who was giving it.  And likewise with Bush on Iraq, certainly the advice he got from Colin Powell at the very beginning not to invade Iraq was very good advice.  But I think Bush was so blinded by his own motives, whatever you think they were, that I think he effectively couldnt hear that.  And then he couldnt hear the very good advice that I said came from Bill Kristol, among other people that the strategy was failing and  You know, it finally took just a series, I mean it got to the point really where there was a total consensus that the strategy was failed, and that Rumsfeld was failing and I think Bush postponed change until there was absolutely no choice.', 'I think Obama should focus as hes appropriately doing on Afghanistan and how to turn around a deteriorating situation there.  I think he should figure out, how to get us out of Iraq without Iraq falling back into the situation it was in before the surge.   I think those are comthings that are compatible, I think theyre possible.  And, you know, much of this is so invisible to us that its very hard when we say Bush has kept us safe.  Its true, we have not had another terrorist attack in the United States.  How much of that is the result of policy, how much is the result of accident.  We dont know that much about it, its the dog that didnt bark.  Would another President have handled it differently, I dont think so.  I think that itsits impossible to say.', 'What do you mean, Karl, by fight them over there, they werent in Iraq.  Unless you meant somewhere else by over there.', 'Well, I wasnt', 'Hang on', 'Okay.', 'Thank you.  Weve won the war in Iraq, theres something about this mission accomplished language that always makes me a little nervous.  I think the damage in Iraq can be mitigated, but it cant the war cant be vindicated as a decision.   And this goes to the heart of our disagreement, Bill said at the beginning that Bush had bad choices, I dont think he had bad choices, I think he made bad choices.  And I think things couldve been different for Bush.  I think he couldve taken a different approach, and in fact it was the approach he took when he was governor of Texas. He couldve united the country and the world after September 11th, it wouldve given him an opportunity to be a great President, he couldve reached out to the other party the way FDR did after Pearl Harbor.  He couldve kept his focus on Americas real enemies, as opposed to becoming distracted by Saddam Hussein. He couldve compromised with Democrats on a whole range of issues including climate change, expanding health care coverage, entitlement reform.  He couldve focused on protecting the free market instead of the interests of big business.   And I think if Bush had tried to govern from the center right, instead of from the far right, he wouldve been reelected by a bigger margin in 2004 and he wouldve been a successful President.  But Bush was never up to the job of being President, and its not a matter of lacking in intelligence, its a matter of lacking character.   Bush wasnt interested enough in policy, he couldnt tolerate challenge or dissent or disagreement, he couldnt open his mind long enough to consider alternatives or admit the possibility that he might sometimes be wrong.   He let his righteousness and his arrogance and his anger get the better of him.  And in the end I think whats so damning about Bush and what does make him the worst President of the last 50 years, is that these were things within his control.  And to finish, I think we can say at this point that, Americans great nepotistic experiment is finally coming to an end.  Its  [APPLAUSE]   And as my colleague Simon Jenkins has said, its finishing not just with failure, not just with rejection, but in global disgrace.']\n",

      "['Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Thank you all for being here tonight, what a great audience, I have a very simple way of stating my case for the motion.  And its a conclusion thats based on some facts, facts are good, so here are a few facts.   If you Google Tibetan independence, youll get back pointers to some sites, that advocate the freedom of Tibet from Chinese rule.  Tibet.org, Friends of Tibet.org, sites associated with the Dalai Lama, and others.   Youll also get back some sites, that advocate against the freedom of Tibet from Chinese rule.  Thats if you go home tonight, and use the version of Google that you have available to you in this country.  But if you do it inside China, you wont get references to Tibet.org, or Friends of Tibet.org, except perhaps, for references, to sites explaining that those are illegal and banned organizations.   Or Epic Times, Epic Times is a Chinese newspaper, an uncensored Chinese newspaper.  You can find it on the Internet, just Google Epic Times.  But try to do that in China, and you will not find your way to Epic Times.  Same thing with human rights if you Google that, or various spiritual practices.   The world looks very different through the window that Google provides, in China, than through the window on the world that you have available to yourselves here.  In fact, its not the picture window on the world, its a distorted lens that has been built, custom-built by Google to Chinese specifications. Now how did that happen.  Google is the company, whose mission is to organize the worlds information, and to make it universally accessible and useful.  How did it come to be in the business of creating the distorting lens, rather than the picture window on the world.  Well, in 2004, Google was entering the international market, it wanted to be the number-one search engine in the world, it started to do business in China.   And the Chinese said, we dont want you to show our citizens the world as it really is, with all of its complexities, and its contradictions, and its inconsistent sources of information.  We want the Chinese citizens to know the world the way we want them to know the world.  And, Google said, okay, well give them that world instead of the world as it really is. Their choice was, to accept the Chinese ultimatum, or to go home.  They couldve gone home, they didnt, they stayed, and built the engine as the Chinese wanted it.  Now its a wonderful product.  I agree with everything thats been said about what a wonderful product it is and what a wonderful company it is.   But here its been turned from a wonderful product, that we know, into an instrument of thought control.  Now some may weakly claim that its doing more good than harm  that the Chinese people are better off getting partial information via the Google search window than getting no information at all.   Thats nonsense, there are other search warrants, through which you can get the censored truth, if thats what you want people to provide.  Google didnt choose the lesser of two evils when faced with the Chinese ultimatum; it chose the more profitable of the two evils. And for that reason, you should vote for the proposition, that Google is violating its Dont be evil motto.  They had a simple choice that was put before them.  I stopped a street vendor here in New York last week, who was selling Tibetan jewelry, hes a Tibetan.   And I said, Im gonna debate this issue.  What do you think the answer is, I dont have to explain it to him, he knew exactly that Google works differently inside China, than it does here.  And here is what he saidhe said, Google had a choice between morality and money, and it chose money.   Thats why Google is violating its Dont be evil motto.  Its a company that does many good works.  Its true that Google as a whole is not evil, Ill grant that, but thats not the question before us.  If the question before us was, Google is evil, thats what the question would be. That isnt the question, the question is, does it violate what it claims not to donot being evil.  A good indicator that youre doing something wrong is that the Congress hauls your executives, in front of them, and yells at you.   And Congress has gotten into the habit of doing this several times.  Most recently in May.  Senator Richard Durbin confronted Google executives on this censorship question, and said, When youre asked to be complicit in restricting the flow of information, arent your hands a little dirty at the end of the day if you participate in that. There is legislation under consideration, to prohibit exactly what Google is doing.  Now to be sure, Google is in the business to make money, if it doesnt sell advertising anywhere, then its not going to make money, but its making plenty of money.  And it would have been such a statement, to the international world about the importance of, of information freedom. My friends, you are here tonight, because you value the robust debate of conflicting ideas.  You value facts, you believe [WARNING TONE] the truth is revealed, through this kind of debate and conflict.  You shouldyou must vote for this proposition, if you support the idea that creating censorship tools is a form of evil.   Finally, just let me close with one analogy. Suppose Google were not a search engine company, but a pharmaceutical company.  And it was told by the Chinese government that it could sell aspirin in China, only if it also made certain forms of brainwashing drugs and thought control medications.  And that was the condition on which it could sell aspirin in China.  No responsible American company would make that deal with the Chinese authorities, and that is exactly what Google is doing in the digital realm.  So, please vote for the motion, Google Violates its Dont Do Evil Motto, because they do.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Uh, not my daughter', \"Id just like to point out that our opposition tried both tactics to persuade you to vote against the motion.  They said that evil means Hitler, Pol Pot, and the worst gulags of the Soviet Union. And theyve also said, they mean by evil something thats a much higher standard.  Now, I would like to think, and I would like to ask the opposition if they dont think that when Google made their motion, made their motto, dont be evil, that they were not holding them to the standard that they shouldn't be as evil as Pol Pot, Hitler, and the worst of the Soviet Union, and if anything better than that, they would get a pass on the dont be evil motto.  [LAUGHTER]\", 'It was an aspirational statement', 'and just as many of us make promises that we have to acknowledge we are unable to keep, Google has been unable, virtuously and continuously, to keep its aspirational promise.  I think its a good thing that Google made that aspirational promise.  The question is whether it ever violates it, and the answer is plainly that it does.', 'Thanks a lot, shell love you for that. LAWRENCE LESSIG is that it complies with the Chinese rules about censoring a certain class of speech. During the political campaign that weve just ended, John McCain complained to Yahoo, I mean, to YouTube, part of Google, that YouTube was complying with American copyright laws and censoring a whole bunch of speech that he thought should be kept up on the internet.  Now, would you say a company is evil when it complies with American law and censors speech, or is it, or is a company', \"In the case of John McCain, I'm actually with John McCain in wishing that YouTube would exercise a little more judgement before it automatically pulled the, the campaign videos down, although I understand the practical reasons why thats important, and I understand why, under the Safe Haven rules, they would have the knee jerk reaction.  But Google actually could afford to review some of those videos in the middle of a political campaign to make a judgement about whether they were fair use or not, and I wish they had.

It would have been in their long term interests, as many of the other measures that Google has made had.', 'I was waiting for this Clintonian, or Clinton-esque moment where the debate turned to the question of what the meaning of be is.

Google is a business, and that, the issue for Google only came up because they wanted to set up shop inside China, have employees there, run their servers there, and do business with, inside China, and there are rules inside China for how businesses have to operate.  And if I can just respond to Professor Lessigs statement, I agree that businesses doing business in a country have to obey the laws of the country they're doing business in.  And my contention is that Google made the wrong decision in deciding to do business in a country whose demands were so inconsistent with their fundamental mission in life.\", 'Well, if I can just add', 'Just to be clear, Google is not actually the major search engine thats actually used in China, so there are other avenues.', 'Well, not everyone, Esther, theyre not giving that power to everyone.  Evil was Googles term, we didnt set the terms of this debate, the Intelligence Squared people didnt set the terms of this debate.  Google set the terms of this debate, by putting that grand proposition out there.  Dont be evil.   Some of the things theyre doing, they themselves know arent right.  They themselves would prefer not to be censoring search results in China, and they have allied themselves with other corporations into a new consortium that is   And theyve pledged themselves to try to lift this restriction, over the coming years.  Now, theyre to be respected for that, as they are to be respected for all of the other enlightening things that the other side keeps pointing out they are doing.   But its not a proposition about on aggregate, are they 10 percent more good than they are evil.  The question is, do they violateviolate is an active verb, thats awe wontokay, lets not parse.  [LAUGHTER]  Do they violate their Dont be evil motto and I just repeat that the construction of censorship tools is an act of evil.  Thank you.']\n",
      "['Thank you very much.  I want to thank Intelligence Squared and the Rosenkranz Foundation for organizing what I think will be a fun and lively evening.  So, the resolution before us is that Google Violates its Dont Do Evil Motto, I think its important for us to frame that and understand what that means and what it doesnt mean.  The question isnt whether Google is a great company.  I think it is.  I thought what Bob Rosenkranz said about it is exactly right, much to admire.  The question isnt whether Google does more good than evil.  I think it does.  Thats not the question either. The questions whether we can identify certain things which they do which we think are important to how Google operates, that are inconsistent with that motto.  And I think we can.  So we should start where that motto comes from.  When Google was going to become a public company it filed its registration statement, if you havent read those, theyre remarkably dull.  [LAUGHTER]  Not Googles.  Google opens with an owners manual for future Google shareholders.  Page and Brin say, were not an ordinary company, were not gonna be an ordinary company.  Get ready for the ride.  Okay.  Part of that is Google says, were gonna live by a motto, and that model is, is were not gonna be evil. Seemingly asking us to hold Google to a higher standard, theyre very clear.  Therell be times when they will sacrifice the short- run interests of Google for the public good.  I dont think whats legal is the standard to evaluate for Google, Google asks us for something much more public-interested. Google then compares itself to newspapers.  Well thats interesting, right, they seem to be on diverging paths but I think they thought there was some sense of a public trust associated with newspapers, and we should hold Google to that as well. Thats what were gonna try to do tonight.  My piece of this is Im going to focus on the heart of Googles business which is their advertising model.   And Im going to focus on the recent deal that was proposed between Google and Yahoo, where Yahoo was going to out-source a large chunk of its search-ad business to Google. I should say I consulted in connection with the opposition, so you can discount what I say as you wish.  I should say we won, thats good news, because that deal has gone away, the Department of Justice suggested that they were going to challenge the deal in courtthat was something clearly Google didnt want so they backed away from it. All right.  Advertisers were opposed to the deal.  Why were advertisers opposed.  Advertisers believed that the deal and the core of the deal was if you think of search queries, theres a lot of common queries, theres a lot of unusual queries.  The deal is going to out-source the long tail as it were, Chris Andersons term of queries, away from Yahoo to Google.   Advertisers were upset about that.  Why.  Well, advertisers believed that prices were going to go up because of that.  Googles response to that was to saywe run auctions.  We dont set prices.  Advertisers set prices.  Were just middlemen.   Thats not right, and I think Google knows better.  I should say, Im  a Google Ad Words advertiser, so if youve not looked at the system, the way it works, you can set an account up very easily, pay five dollars to do so Im advertising, I thought I should understand how Ad Words works, so Im advertising a paper that I wrote on anti-trust and privacy and cloud computing.  Im not sure who the second click has been, um  [LAUGHTER]   Okay.  But you see how that works.  You can click, and go.  But the nature of this is that you bid on keyword terms, if you win the auction your ads are supposed to show up.   Now Google understands that how you design auctions matters, theres a whole field of economics devoted to that.  They gave William Vickery from Columbia a Nobel Prize for that.  Google is designing its auctions in a way that takes advantage of its market power.  Does that in three important ways.  First, Google runs a system involving minimum bids.  So cloud neutrality is one of the terms that Im bidding on. You can run a search on cloud neutrality, I did yesterday. I know my ad is out there.  It didnt show up, indeed no ads showed up, and indeed if you look at the statistics, 50 percent of the time when you run a search on Google, and they produce results, the organic search results, there are no ads next to it. Even though if you believe the comments, and as I say Im one of these Ad Words adAd Words advertisers, my ad is out there waiting to be served and even though the search that has been done, if they dont run an ad its an opportunity to show an ad which is lost forever.   So there was a chance for Google to get money there and yet theyre not doing it.  Why, because if very few people are bidding then I ought to be able to buy it for a very low price and Googles interest is not served by that. Google wants to make sure that theres a high enough minimum, theyve been raising the minimums over time, such that Google meaningfully makes money on that.  If you look at the blogs, people comment on this, they talk about bidding against the house, thats what they have to do.  And Google has changed the terms in which they do that.  Okay?  Thats an exercise in market power.  I should say under current US anti-trust law one of the things I do for a living, I dont think thats illegal.  Evil?  Well, thats the resolution for the house tonight.  Thats one.  Two.  If youre an auctioneer, the way you exercise market power, is you control the number of slots.  Right, you dont control prices, you control quantities.  In Googles case that means how many slots are available on the right-and side next to the organic search results.  Google controls that.  Now you might think in a competitive model that wed have some relationship between the number of ads on Yahoo and the number of ads on Google. Indeed the central premise of the Yahoo-Google deal was that Google does [WARNING TONE] a better job of ad matching than Yahoo does.  We should therefore expect Google to have more ads than Yahoo, just the opposite.  Again, market power being exercised, not illegal, evil, you decide.   Finally, third point. Google engages in a kind of bundling, so Google also organizes search for Ask and AOL.  You can buy Google alone, you cant buy Ask and AOL alone.  They are bundled together with Google. Right, advertisers would like to be able to advertise separately on those.  Cant do it, they wont let you do that.  Illegal under US law, EU law?  Maybe, well see.  Right?  Evil, mmm, I think you can conclude.  Now, why should we care about this.   The importance of advertising is the way that advertising supports paid content.  Right?  You should care a lot about the kind of content thats out there, and to the extent that the middleman is making it more expensive for people to reach consumers, were going to have less content because producers are effectively going to get a lower chunk of the advertising dollars.  [WARNING TONE REPEATS]  Ill stop there, thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'I hate to be a textualist, but I brought the registration statement with me, right, lets see what it says.  Dont be evil.  We believe strongly that in the long term we will be better served as shareholders and in all other ways by a company that does good things for the world, even if we forgo some short term gains.  The question is, when does Google, faced with a conflict between whats good for the world sacrifice its own interests.  I dont think its doing that.', \"Yeah, dont focus on the dollars, focus on a different issue.  So the basic structure of copyright law is, subject to fair use, you have to get permission.  Google has done something incredibly clever, evil, I dont know, in the settlement which is, by turning it into an opt-out class action, and now I just said a bunch of legal words that you're not going to like, theyve effectively changed the default position with regard to how copyrights consent system works.  Thats either brilliant because of the orphan works problem, clever, or evil, I dont know.\", 'Yeah.', 'Very much so, I think.  Maybe the public interest at the same time[OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'Yeah, so on the question', 'On the question of demise, I think that the question is, is Microsoft, who wanted to buy Yahoo before, still a natural purchaser.  Obviously the scuttlebutt in todays newspapers and online is that the change in management yesterday may increase that possibility. So if you ask what the natural deal is, thats the natural deal.  Its not obvious to me that deal will actually matter. Maybe Esthers in a better position to talk about that, but that seems to me the most natural next move for Yahoo.', \"Well, I'm both a lawyer and an economist.  And as an economist I think the issue before us is what Ill call marginal evil, incremental evil.  I think thats where we are with regard to Google.  Thats the question.  When are they creating evil that they don't need to create?  When are they making a choice that we should understand to be one that benefits Google and hurts the market, hurts other participants in that market.  Where I started was something that went to the heart of their business model.  This isn't a side show, this is not an experiment, this is at the heart of the way Google does business.  And what they are doing there is doing exactly what we see monopolists doing. Since the Sherman Act was passed in 1890, they exercise market power.  Thats what Google is doing.  We heard a lot of discussion, I haven't heard, actually, anything about that.  I think thats because its not possible to refute that, and I dont think its actually transparent to most people how they're doing it.  And when someone asks Google whether they're doing that, Google says, were running auctions, we dont have power, notwithstanding our market share is sixty-five percent in the United States.  That is acting in a way that is being evil.\"]\n",
      "['Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]  To my distinguished opponents, I see your Dr. Evil and your Dr. Pol Pot, and I raise you a pope and a poet.  Specifically, Pope Gregory the Great, and the great poet Dante Alighieri.  Because after all, one of the things we have to figure out here, is what do we mean by evil. Well Google encourages us to think algorithmically, after all its built everything that it has on algorithms.  One of the simplest forms of algorithms, the if-then statement, or if you prefer, the checklist, Dante offers us such a checklist in The Divine Comedy. I know you know it, I know you know it with me, so say it along with me, the seven deadly sins, luxuria, gula, avaritia, acedia, ira, invidia, and superbia, right?  Well, okay, you didnt say it along with me.   To walk through, I can show you that Google has at times committed every single one of these seven deadly sins. [LAUGHTER]  The first, luxuria, which translates as extravagance or lust.  I spent a bit of time on the Google campus out in Californiathey get massages.  [LAUGHTER]   Right, the people who work there get massages.  That is, that is corporeal lust of the highest order.  [LAUGHTER]  Or at least for a bunch of geeks about the best theyre gonna do.  Um  [LAUGHTER] Number two, gula or gluttony, the other thing about the Google campus is they get incredible food, all they can eat all day, no matter what they want, there is so much food that they never need to say no, that is the very definition of gluttony.   Number three.  Avaritia, greed.  Weve already heard from Randy about the greed embodied in the Google-Yahoo advertising dealthat is one of many examples of Google overreaching to corner a market, or completely undermine a market, in an effort to maximize its returns.  Number four, acedia, sloth.  Now I could talk about how lazy and self-satisfied Google was in its effort to roll out an on- line video service.   The early days of Google Video were very much a matter of figuring they owned the video realm and they werent actually gonna do anything new or fantastic until these whippersnappers at YouTube came across with their Flash video platform, and basically ran around them to the point where they ended up having to buy that company just to keep pace. But theres actually a better example of sloth and that is Google itself, its very nature, its very model of advertising is based on free-riding.  Google makes money off of our work.  We blog, we put our skateour cats on skateboards and record them for videos.  We do all of this work, and then Google harvests our work, runs all of this content through this computers, spits it back out at us, with almost no actual value added and what we end up getting is a tremendous amount of money, based on free- riding, the very definition of sloth.   Wrath, ira, wrath.  There are a number of high-profile cases of people who have been involved with Google through their Ad Sense program, through which theyve agreed to place ads on their own blogs.  I think Jeff is one of these people but not one who has suffered the wrath of Google. Many of these people have found their accounts shut down, their revenues stopped, for reasons that can never be explained, but they did something to violate Googles policies.  But they get no feedback and no response, and no justice. And then there are hundreds of small companies all around America, that have found their ranks decimated, their Google ranks decline significantly, because again, they tried to optimize their results, they were just doing what a company should do, trying to get more attention for themselves.   And Googles algorithms, its faceless, soulless algorithms came at them with wrath, another of the seven deadly sins.  Invidia, envy.  Google has over the last few years engaged in a series of efforts to try to muscle in on the markets of other successful companies, Microsoft being the most prominent. Google has recently tried to push its suite of services that directly compete with Microsoft Office.  Of course they have at various times threatened to muscle out eBay, muscle out PayPal, muscle out Amazon, in various ways.  Number seven, the one I want to talk about the most, superbia, pride, or hubris.   Now, let me remind you of the actual motto of the company, its not Do no evil or Dont be evil, its actually, To organize the worlds information to make it universally accessible.  What could be more hubristic than that.  What could be more prideful than that. General Motors doesnt say were gonna organize all the places in the country and make them universally accessible.  General Motors says were gonna try to sell cars.  Not that thats the best example to use this week, I understand.  [LAUGHTER] Nonetheless, no company besides Google would ever come up with a motto or a mission statement like that, but let me tell you something that Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google said a number of years ago, during an interview when someone asked him, what would the perfect search engine be like. And he said, without missing a beat, it would be like the mind of God.  Ladies and gentlemen, thats more than hubris, thats blasphemy.  [LAUGHTER]  Now the particular kind of hubris that energizes Google is of course, a sense of techno-fundamentalism. The notion that you can always invent something, to solve the problem that the last invention created.   And that faith in technology, that technology can cover all of our sins and all of our faults and fix all of our problems, is again the ultimate hubris, its the hubris expressed in the myth of Pandora for instance, the myth of having too much knowledge.  There are so many examples in human history in which techno- fundamentalism has led to great suffering.  Not that Google is about to lead us to great suffering, but theyre still committing the sin of hubris. Now hubris is actually the most serious of the seven deadly sins. As Dante explains to us, it was the sin that Lucifer committed. Lucifer [WARNING TONE] was a good guy.  Lucifer fell, because he thought he could be as effective as God, as good as God, and thus, he became Satan.  The very notion of the Dont be evil motto, is itself hubristic, is itself, evil, because it is itself a violation of the seven deadly sins.   One real-world example, let me finish with very quickly, Google Book Search.  Google has been trying to scan in 36 million books from libraries around the world, in an effort to essentially corner the market on digital book access, for a number of years.   Early on, four years ago when it started this project or got public with this project, it claimed that everything was cool as far as copyright was concerned.  In other words, copyright only applies to mere mortals, not to superhuman supercompanies like Google.  Well, it turns out Google wasnt right about that, last month Google ended up having to settle, and wrote a check for $125 million to publishers and authors [sic], because it turns out, they werent quite as on the ball about copyright as they thought.  [WARNING TONE REPEATS]  Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]', 'Thats blasphemy!', 'Yeah, Jim, youve fallen into my trap. [LAUGHTER]', 'Of course.  So, youve fallen into my trap by citing the fact that every company should be expected to compete, and should, in fact, probably be extravagant, be gluttonous, be greedy, be slothful, be wrathful, and be envious, and of course, hubristic. Every company should, because thats what companies should do, they should compete, they should win, they should crush', 'And by that, by that I say, it is for the companies to violate the seven deadly sins, and not to pretend they dont, and it is for popes and poets to warn us against it.', \"So, Jeff has compared Google to Wall Street firms and said, wouldn't it be great if Wall Street firms had that motto chiseled in their buildings.  Hes compared Google to newspapers that have local monopolies, and pointed out that newspapers, of course, fix prices on advertising.  And now hes compared Google to Yahoo. None of that matters.  It does not matter that any other company behaves badly, or behaves in an evil way, because none of those companies ever were foolish enough to chisel such a motto into their buildings or their financial filing statements.  Now that, the fact is\", 'that Google has set its own standard, and has not met its own standard.', 'Yeah, Ill', 'I dont want to argue that, that making this material available is an example of evil, what was evil was the hubris in arguing that they could fly above the basics of copyright when they do it.  And Larry and I have had this argument going on for about four years, we dont want to invite everybody else into it, nonetheless, we', 'Were at, were at loggerheads on it.  But I do want to point out that of the hundred and twenty-five million dollars that Google willfully paid in the settlement, people dont give away money for nothing, they basically were paying the authors and the publishers ninety-one million dollars to settle the damages that were claimed by the authors and publishers.  Right?  Simple math.  No something for nothing.  The extra services that Google is now providing will take up thirty-four million dollars of that that hundred and twenty-five million.  So, in fact, the settlement was a concession that they probably had flown too close to the sun', 'Someones been selling Googles shares', \"Well, exactly.  But people have been selling Google shares for reasons they don't disclose. Right?  Its a simple signal they send to the market.  Nonetheless, remember that a publicly traded company thats doing very well can afford to hold out a motto like Dont be evil.  When things get tough, and as Harrys brought up, they have to make a decision between revenue and egalitarianism, they're going to pick revenue, as they have every time.\", \"Very brief.  I actually want to echo what Esther said, and again, just because there are more evil institutions in the world than Google does not mean that our case, that they violated their motto, is not true.  Right?  The fact that the federal government is much more evil does not absolve Google of responsibility of maintaining information that can be easily, secretly gathered. Right?  If the FBI comes with a national security letter to Google and says, we want to know everything about Randy Picker, Randy Picker will never know that that happens, and no one at Google can talk about the fact that it happens.  Right? Thats the black box were dealing with.  Google is a black box, the federal government is a black box.  The interaction of two black boxes are, is a serious danger.  That doesn't mean Google has done anything specifically, actively evil, but it certainly has enabled the potential of real evil.\", \"The issue behind privacy and the regulation of personal information is not that people should or should not, or do or do not want to share.  The issue is a matter of personal autonomy. Having the easy to access controls over who sees what in what context.  And its a much more fluid complicated and multi- faceted question that simply the idea that we are putting our favorite music up on Facebook in large, in torrents.  That's true, but its not relevant.  The fact is, Chrome and Gmail offer us no way to manage our personal information.  Google service\", 'harvest their, that information, and people use Chrome and Gmail without any real knowledge or recognition or simple acknowledgement of the transaction.  Most people who use Google do not understand the transaction in which they are engaging.  And that is a problem.', \"Oh, we each have the capacity of judging whether any particular action is evil.  I, of course, am appealing to authority, one of the classic fallacies, the authority being Dante and Pope Gregory. But, I didn't mean to do so quite so facetiously.  I do mean to say that all of the things that big, successful corporations should do tend to trample on the cannon of good and evil that we have been swimming in.  And in fact, its hypocritical for a company to say that it will hold itself to a high standard.  Its perfectly reasonable for Google to do almost everything it has done as a profit making venture, uh, and I applaud most of what its done.  But the real question is, is this standard itself being undermined by its very actions?  Is the fact that it set this high standard for itself ultimately foolish?\", 'Lucifer did not fall because he wanted to be bad.  Like Jessica Rabbit he was drawn that way.  [LAUGHTER]  in fact he fell [LAUGHTER]  He fell because he was trying to be great.  Now, I firmly believe that companies should be companies.  That governments should be governments.   That saints should be saints, that sinners should be sinners, that gods should be gods, and devils should be devils.  The claims of corporate responsibility are basically, cyclical marketing ploys, disguised, disguised as something great and good.   The fact is Google grew as big and successful as it has, not only because it is great, and it isbut because it claimed to be good.  Google never bought a Super Bowl ad, to my knowledge, Google never bought an ad. Right? Google got big because in the early days, a whole lot of us who were very active on the web were disgusted by the status quo and we gravitated to Google not only because it seemed to satisfy our needs, but because it satisfied our need to avoid evil and the evil in those days was number one, Microsoft, and number two, Yahoo.   And in both cases, Google was able to getgain our loyalty.  It was a cynical marketing ploy, one that in the long run, it will not and in fact has not lived up to.  People really believed it was not evil, many people still believe it does not do evil.  The fact is companies should make money, and the rest of us should beware.  So please vote for the proposition.']\n",

      "[\"Thank you, John.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]  Its a real pleasure to be here, I think one of the remarks that Gil just made, shows the difference between our country and England, historically, not just today.  Our country was founded when the British government had a policy of colonialism in which it sought to exploit the Americans, to tax them without representation, and when the Americans protested there was an escalation, and the British sought to disarm the Americans that led to violence, because the Americans thought this is our only chance to protect ourselves.  When you look at a debate topic like this, Guns reduce crime, for and against, lets define our terms a little bit, guns possessed by who.   Guns possessed by law-abiding citizens reduce crime but not guns possessed by criminals, and, what does crime mean, we look at the term crime I think in awe should look at it in a very broad way.  Crime means the unjust aggression against life, liberty, and property, of another person. So crime can be committed...singly by one person against another or, in small groups by a gang of criminals against another.  Or at the highest level it can be committed by governments.  When we look at the problem of genocide, the problem of crimes against humanity, these are major crimes involving large populations frequently in which guns are used unjustly and theres an ability to do that on behalf of authoritarian or police states because the population is disarmed.   So, when we look at this issue we should look at not just here and now,  what happens in the United States, or whats happened in the last decade or two, or what happens today, but look at it historically in terms of what sorts of societies have existed historically and which ones have balance and democracy and republicanism and which ones are the kinds of states that you dont wanna live in, Nazi Germany, Uganda under Idi Amin or Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, I meanthis is real.  We live in a society thats very nice right now, its not guaranteed that itll always be that way, either, in terms of your own personal life or in terms of the possibility that a government could turn bad.   What I think were advocating tonight, those of us on the side of the proposition, is that you should have freedom of choice to protect yourself if you decide to do that.  One of the questions that was asked recently in the US Supreme Court,  the District of Columbia was trying to defend its handgun ban and they said that its okay to ban handguns and that all guns should have trigger locks and be disassembled and never loaded.  And one of the Supreme Court justices asked the question, well what if you hear the door crash in and youre fumbling for your reading glasses and trying to turn on the lamp and your hands are tremblingmaybe it would be a good idea to have a gun available if something like that happened so, the question is not whether everybody should have a gun, but the question is should you have the ability to exercise that freedom of choice if you are a responsible citizen, and thats your decision to do so.  Our American Revolution proved the ability of an armed populace basically to defeat a tyranny and thats why we ended up in our Bill of Rights with the right of the people to keep and bear arms, the declaration that it shall not be infringed, and also a declaration in favor of a militia because that enhanced the security of a free state, security means that a free state is preserved as a viable political entity, it has republican institutions and people themselves are able to dissuade tyranny, theyre able to fight individual criminals.  It was always considered to be a responsibility of individuals to, in the ancient hue and cry and the watch and ward, to, if criminals were on the loose, to try to catch them.  And now we have degenerated somewhat into a society, where you dont help anybody, and we have many instances where criminals are attacking people and nobody basically gives a damn.   Sobasically it comes back to freedom of choice, Id like to use a couple of maybe legal cases, to illustrate the point.  Youve heard D.C. became the murder capitol of the United States after it enacted a handgun ban. Theres no duty of the police to protect you, its not just impossible for them to do so, its not a legal duty.  Right before the handgun ban in D.C. was enacted, there were three women who were in a boarding house, and they were broken into.  And there were two individuals who, over a period of many, many hours, raped and robbed and otherwise assaulted them.  They called 911 several times, and the police would come knock on the door and nobody would respond.  The police would drive by the house, because these ladies made repeated calls to 911.  And so this ordeal, this nightmare finally ended, and they sued the DC government.  And the courts ruled that there is no duty of government to protect any individual person.  They have a duty to society at large, which is just kind of a useless concept when you're an individual and you're a crime victim.  So theres no duty to protect you.  And then the question becomes, well, maybe you would like to protect yourself.  Maybe you would like to at least have the legal right to do that.  And thats what the second amendment is partly intended to guarantee.  Thats what the Supreme Court just held in DC versus Heller that we do have an individual right to keep and bear arms.  And its a right.  Its not something you have to do.  Its not a duty.  But its something that you can do.  I represented a group of litigants in a companion case, and they live in the ghetto in DC, they're victims of robberies, house break-ins.  This happened repeatedly.  And they were good citizens, and they simply wanted access to guns. The same thing could be illustrated in Hurricane Katrina where the police chief announced no law abiding citizen could have guns, and basically they, the police themselves disarmed individual citizens.  And we see the result of that.  But if you went across the river into Algiers, the community known as Algiers, citizens armed themselves, they provided their own arms, and they kept violence down, they kept looting down.  The same thing happened in the LA riots, and the same thing happened in Hurricane Andrew in Florida.  There was no police protection, no national guard protection for several days.  Armed citizens came forward and basically made sure that there was no looting, and no robberies, and no murders proceeding.  So, the bottom line is, we dont have the same system as England.  You didn't hear Gil announce that the Seattle police force should disarm themselves. To the contrary, we should have armed police forces, and we should have that right to be exercised by individual citizens. Thank you. [APPLAUSE]\", '[INAUDIBLE]', 'Theres something really bizarre about this picture that citizens with guns are totally incompetent and police with guns are totally incompetent and theyre likely to be taken away from them, but somehow criminals are really good with guns, where where did they get all this training.', 'Theres something bizarre about this picture that, citizens and police cannot defend themselves with guns but criminals can successfully use guns to aggress against other people, it doesnt makeits against common sense.  Im not a statistician, I dont think Paul is either, were the two who arent here but it just doesnt make sense to say that you should never be able to protect yourself, that you shouldnt use a gun, that youre incompetent, that youre totally worthless with it andits just, against any common sense.   And, the fact that, this is not just a legalism, police have no duty to protect you.  Its not their fault by the way, of course their slogan is to protect and serve, they want to do that.  But they have no legal compulsion to do it and of course even if you could sue them if they didnt protect you after the kinds of scenarios we talked about, it wouldnt do you any good, you may be dead or youre otherwise injured.  You want to be able to prevent the crime from happening.  And the only way to do that in some circumstances is you have to be able to protect yourself.', 'Because they dont know who has it, and if you have a', 'If youre in a state that has mandatory issuance of concealed- weapon permits, then criminals have no knowledge of who might be carrying legally, and you would think there would be more who would carry if it is legal than those who would do it out of desperation because of fear', 'Absolutely, because the criminals dont know who has the gun.', 'The Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms and the question is what kinds of arms are Constitutionally protected and the Supreme Court just addressed that in the Heller case and said that, handguns are commonly possessed by law-abiding citizens historically for lawful purposes.  Rifles and shotguns, now, the term AK-47 is very ambiguous, if it means a real AK-47 that means a fully automatic machine gun.  Theyre very highly restricted in this country, they have to be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Theyre not possessed by that many people, theyre not used in crimes by the way, registered AK-47s, theres not very many of them around.  But thats really never where the debate has been, the debate has always been, for example the Brady Center supporting the D.C. handgun ban.   What people are concerned about is the ability to have a normal kind of gun in their house to protect themselves and to have rifles, pistols and shotguns for sporting purposes or other lawful purposes.  The debate has never been about AK-47, theres been there are certain kinds of rifles that might look like an AK-47 and theyre called by the press assault weapons but theyre not assault weapons and theyre not AK-47s, they just have certain cosmetic features that are similar, so', 'Real AK-47s, I dont know of anybody who advocates deregulating them under current, the federal law which is very strict', 'The', 'Right, the National Firearms Act passed in 1934 provides that, certain kinds of highly restricted firearms can be registered and possessed by law-abiding citizens who go through these extreme background checks and   If you were to pass a ban on any kind of gun it does raise questions under the Second Amendment as well as the Interstate Commerce Clause, and there was a Supreme Court where we raised that issue.  We did not argue that machine guns were protected by the Second Amendment, we argued that, a constitutional issue was raised by whether they should be banned or not and its something that   It had to do with a statutory interpretation, its not a case that was a Second Amendment casethe only Second Amendment case the Supreme Court has dealt with is the Heller case, and its decided that the kind of guns that were all ordinarily talking about here, rifles, pistols and handguns are the ones that are, Im sorry, rifles, shotguns and handguns are the ones that are constitutionally protected these other issues are red herrings.', 'Thank you, John, I want to respond to two things that Professor Donohue has stated in the Heller case the Supreme Court decided that the Second Amendment guarantees the individual right of, of individual citizens to keep and bear arms including handguns.   Thats the position that the NRA has taken, for many, many decades through of its history since 1871.  And Mr. Donohue said that the NRA does not tell the truth on the Second Amendment.   Well, then the Supreme Court doesnt either because thats what the Supreme Court held in the Heller case.  If you walk out back and you go to the bookstand here at this auditorium youll see a book called The Founders Second Amendment, which I authored-- its a new book on the history of the Second Amendment and youll see, basically agreement with what the Supreme Court held, that it is an individual right, that the NRA did not make it up.  In addition, Ive been to Switzerland many times and participated in shooting matches with military rifles.   And you can buy all the ammunition you want at the shooting ranges and at gun shops.  Youre issued a tin of ammunition that youre not allowed to open because they want it to be available if the militia army has to be mobilized, but theres no restriction on your ammunition usage or purchases, so its every Swiss male when he enters age 20 is issued a military assault rifle and he keeps it at home.  And theres an extremely low crime rate in Switzerland.  A remaining thought I would like to say in favor of the proposition, is, I would like everybody to kind of think about yourself.  Youve heard here tonight, that were all potential murderers, that if we get angry if we have a gun were gonna kill somebody.   Its just not true, most people with these concealed-weapon permits, are just like you and me, theyre normal people, they dont just suddenly get angry or, or have a couple glasses of wine and, and go on murderous sprees. Were not like that, most Americans are good peoplethey can be trusted with guns, and they should be trained.   Children should be trained in gun safety but to somehow act like [REPEATING WARNING TONE]were all potential criminals is just, completely beyond the pale.']\n",
      "[\"And yes, I'm going to vote for Barack Obama too.  [AUDIENCE REACTION]  Thank you, John, and thank you all for coming out on this very nasty night.  That is indeed an accurate rendition of my background.  The moral of that particular story is, I didn't come to this pro side of this debate via my ideology.  Its the most unnatural thing in the world, from that standpoint.  I didn't come to that position by virtue of my social background.  I grew up in the wilds of suburbia, basically, where guns are scarce.  They dont have guns to commit crimes, they dont have guns to defend against crimes, they dont have guns for hunting, they dont have guns.  My way into this position is basically evidence-based.  I'm boringly scholarly.  Ive been studying this issue for nearly thirty years, Ive written three books, dozens of articles.  Ive published more articles on the effects of defensive use of guns than anyone else.  Oddly enough, sometimes what you can learn from a debate is by listening to the silences, paying attention to what people would be expected to talk about, but dont.  Strictly speaking, the other side actually hasnt addressed the issue of the effectiveness of defensive gun use.  Theyve kind of danced around it, but they haven't actually addressed it head on, and in fact, the organization Paul Helmke represents, the Brady Campaign, previously Handgun Control Incorporated, used to have a very prominent segment of their web site devoted to the proposition that, no, if you try to use a gun for self-protection, you're going to get yourself killed, or injured, or its going to be taken away and used against you.  And theyve more or less stopped talking about it, they're just silent on the issue.  That's significant.  The reason is, the evidence is unanimous, its rare in criminological research for the findings to be unanimous on anything, but they're unanimous on this one. Defensive gun use is effective in the sense that crime victims who use guns during a crime are less likely to be injured or killed, and less likely to lose property than crime victims who adopt any other kind of strategy, including non-resistance.  Non-resistance is not the safest course of action.  And this is so despite the fact that usually when people try to use guns for self-protection, they're doing it under tougher circumstances.  They do it not because they're quick on the trigger, but because they're facing really desperate circumstances, they're likely to be outnumbered, they're likelier to be facing offenders with weapons, including guns, than other victims.  They're more likely than other victims to have already been injured.  And out of desperation, with all of these handicaps against them, then they use guns in an attempt to defend themselves, and from that point on they are not hurt.  Much of the research that previously claimed that, if you tried to use a gun youd only get hurt, it had a simple error in the research that everybody here can understand.  It was an error in terms of what happened first.  Researchers would report that there were many incidents in which people were injured, and they used guns defensively.  What they didn't know, and it turned out once the error was corrected in the research, those were always cases where somebody was first injured, and then used the gun for self protection.  It wasnt using the gun that got them hurt, it was getting hurt that finally pushed them into using the gun.  When they fixed that flaw in the research, they basically found that once people used guns for self protection, they are almost never injured after that point.  Theres good reason why the chiefs police officers carry guns.  They're effective for self protection, but it doesn't require the unique training and experience of police officers for it to be effective.  Its effective basically for everybody. You may not have noticed, but theres actually more consensus among the six of us than might be evident at first.  I dont think anybody really disputes the proposition that the effects of guns depends on who has them. I haven't heard anybody on the other side say that guns in the hands of non-criminals are just as bad in the hands of criminals.  It makes a huge difference.  Basically, guns in the hands of non-criminals, or in the hands of victims, regardless of any prior criminal behavior, reduce violence.  They reduce it in the sense that, once the gun is introduced by the victim, the offender stops aggressing.  Period.  Furthermore, defensive gun use is extremely common, contrary to Professor Donohues claims, its not sheer fantasy that leads us to believe that there are on the order of two million defensive gun uses a year.  Its simply probability sampling surveys of the same sort that Gallop and Harris and every major survey organization uses. You just ask people questions.  You're not going to hear about these defensive gun uses from your newspaper, nor are the police going to hear about them because frankly, if you had been a crime victim who used a gun for self protection in a typical situation, youd be insane to report it to the police.  And of course if the police dont hear about it, neither will your local newspapers.  At best, maybe youd be arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm, because most of these uses occur in public places where you're not supposed to have a gun, unless you have a special carry permit.  At worst what can happen is you can be arrested for the, the assault itself, a criminal assault. It may well be somewhere down the road, after youve gone through a legal nightmare, that you're cleared of these charges, but in the meanwhile you can be bankrupted from the legal expenses, and have your reputation ruined, and nobody reads it on page eighteen that, oh yeah, you know, Joe Smith was cleared of those charges.  So you're not going to hear about it from police statistics, yet scientifically conducted, objectively conducted surveys have, in at least twenty consecutive surveys, found that defensive gun use is not just common, its more common than criminal use is.  And so thats not a fantasy, as Professor Donohue would have you believe, its about as firmly established a fact as we have to go on in this area.  Thank you very much.

Nothing is a perfect solution or a complete solution and you hear no one on this panel make that argument.  Its just a matter of given that we dont have a complete solution to the problem, what do we do in the meanwhile, what do we do right now, what do individuals do, and why would you want to prevent them from doing something that makes them safer.', 'You may remember I started out my opening remarks by saying you sometimes need to listen for the silences, and I think the panelists on the other side demonstrated that because they didnt in fact address the evidence that we presentedPaul Helmke insists we didnt present any evidence, we cited some of the most thoroughly vetted scientific evidence we have on the question. Study after study repeatedly showed the same thing, it showed defensive gun use as common, it showed defensive gun use as effective.  It shows that after we pass these shall-issue carry laws and make it easy to, to get a carry permit, crime does not go up Its also a sign of a weakness, of a particular position when people have to misstate what the issue is, remember the proposition was that guns reduce crime, okay, do they make you safer to have a gunwell, we didnt really hear anything about that.   Instead we hear Paul Helmke saying would you feel comfortable with everybody having a gun, well of course thats not the issue, nobody here proposed that because of course everybody includes lunatics, convicted murderers, robbers, rapists and so on.   Its not the proposition, and in fact no one here even secretly thinks that we ought to do that, its not an issue, so why not confront the issue, do guns reduce crime. Well, in fact guns in the hands of non-criminals, guns in the hands of crime victims, do make them safer.  So what does this imply for policy, well, the implication for policy is, lets do what we can to keep guns away from criminals, but that should not include taking them away from non-criminals who would use them to save their lives, to prevent the completion of rapes and robberies, to prevent injuries, and to prevent the loss of property, we should instead do what common-sensically most of America has been doing for decades which is moderate controls aimed at preventing criminals [REPEATING WARNING TONE] from getting guns but without denying them to non-criminals.']\n",
      "['Well, thank you very much, I appreciate Mr. Rosenkranz putting this on and its an honor to be invited here and the introduction was overly generous.  But guns cause bad things to happen and makesand guns make it easier for bad things to happen.   But guns also make it easier for people to protect themselves and prevent bad things from happening.  Guns make it easier for you to harm somebody, but guns also make it easier for you to deter criminals from attacking to begin with, and turn out to be the most effective way for somebody to go and defend themselves when theyre having to face a criminal by themselves.  Itd be great if police were there all the time, my research finds that police are probably the single most important factor for reducing crime.   But I think one thing the police understand themselves is they virtually always arrive on the crime scenes after the crimes occurred.  And the question you have to ask is what do you advise someone having to do, when theyre having to confront a criminal by themselves?   Even if theyre able to call 911, you know, fast response times are measured in eight or nine or 10 minutes.  And that can be a lifetime for many people.  I think, as Mr. Rosenkranz was mentioning to begin with, a lot of people have a pretty good idea of the bad things that happen with guns. He mentioned the number of suicides.  But you also have, if you look at surveys done by the Justice Department youll find maybe about 400-450,000 crimes are committed each year with guns. By contrast, you have similar types of surveys that indicate that people use guns defensively about 2 million times a year.   So about four to five times more frequently people use guns to stop crimes than guns are used in the commission of crime.  And yet, I assume for exactly the reasons why Mr. Rosenkranz mentioned earlier, people are if anything like to guess the opposite.   I mean if you haveif youre the editor of a newspaper and you have two crimes that youre talking about, one, theres a dead body on the ground, sympathetic person like a victim, and another case where a womans brandished a gun, the would-be criminals run away, no shots are fired, no dead body on the ground, its pretty obvious which storys gonna be considered much more newsworthy.   Now, we all want to try to take guns away from criminals.  I mean one thing thats been tried many times is to go and have gun bans.  The problem is that when you go and pass something like that, the question you have to ask yourself many times is whos most likely to obey the rule.   If it turns out that its the most law-abiding citizens who obey the rule and turn in their guns, relative to the criminals, you can actually see increases in violent crime.  And Washington D.C. is one important example of that.  In 1976, September of 76, D.C. passed a ban banning handguns, it didnt go into effect until February, uh, 77.  Uh, but only once after 76 was D.C.s murder rate as low as it was in 76.  Only twice in two years after that was D.C.s robbery rate as low as it was in 76.   And D.C.s crime rate not only went up relative to what it was in the past, D.C.s crime rate went up relative to neighboring states, it went up compared to the United States as a whole, it went up relative to other large cities.   Heres a graph that shows you for the top 50 cities of the United States, in 1976, D.C. was about 18 percentage points higher than the other 49 cities in the top 50. You can see after that, it keeps on going up, and if I were to have it in 88, it even soars dramatically past that,  but you can see, its about 90 percent higher when you get to 1987, the rate was falling before the ban, relative to other cities and rising dramatically afterward.  Its not just D.C. though.  In Chicago, ban, and they rose afterwards, they rose relative to other cities. One other way I can just mention for D.C. here, D.C. was 15th of the top50 cities prior to the ban.  In half the years after the ban, it was either number one or number two, and it was number four another four years, so two-thirds of the time after the ban, it was one of the top four cities.   It was nowhere even close to that prior to the ban going into effect.  Its just not in the United States.  Worldwide, time after timeand itd be interesting to have people try to show an example where this isnt truewhen you pass bans you see increases in violent crime rates.  The UK, heres an illustration from The Economist a few years ago.  Theyd banned handguns in January 97.  Robbery rates, armed robbery rates were falling up until the time the ban went into effect, and they rose afterwards, if youd continue this graph theyd continue to go up.  Youve had a 340 percent increase since the ban went into effect and the rate at which people are harmed by guns. You look at Ireland, Jamaica  I mean one thing is, people go and say well the reason why the Chicago and D.C. bans didnt work is because its so easy to go and get access to guns in other places.  Well here you have ideal situations, you have island nations, where its relatively easy and go and enforce the borders and protect them.   And yet theyve seen huge increases in the numbers of illegal guns, because essentially all of them are illegal after these bans go into effect.  And yet just as we see here in the UK if you look at Ireland or Jamaica or other places, you see time after time increases in robbery and murder rates and violent crimes.   Now one thing people often do is they look across countries and they say well, look, England has a relatively low gun ownership rate, it has a relatively high murder rate even if their violent crime rate is twice what we are in the United States. And they may point to Japan or Germany or other countries, and they say the United States has more guns, more violent crime. But the thing they have to take into account is these other countries had much, much lower violent crime rates prior to bans going into effect.   In 1900 for example in England, in London, a city of millions of people, [WARNING TONE] with no gun regulations, you had two gun murders, and five armed gun robberies that took place.  And, what you see time after time when these bans go into effect, either violent crime rates no longer drop, or they begin to start to go up, as youve seen in England and other countries.  Probably one of the most controversial things we could talk about are gun-free zones that we have in the United States for things like schools or other places.   And we hear about these things, they, they dominate the news.  But yet one fact doesnt go out, you cannot find one of these multiple-victim shootings in the United States that occur, that takes place inwhere more than three people are killed, that doesnt take place in a gun-free zone where civilians are banned from owning guns.  You want to make places safer.  Banning guns you think are the easy solution to that.  But again if you pass a ban and its the law-abiding good citizens who obey the ban and not the criminals, rather than making it safe for the would-be victims [REPEATING WARNING TONE] you may unintentionally make it safe for the criminals who are intent on trying to harm others and make less for them to worry about, thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, I mean, there are lots of academics that have, Ill just take the fantasy issue first.  There are lots of academics who have looked at the relationship between concealed hand gun laws and crime rates, and if you look at papers published in refereed academic journals by economists and criminologists, youll find about seventy percent of them find that when right to carry laws get passed, theres drops in violent crime rates.  About thirty percent say theres no change thats there.  And then theres not one refereed academic journal that I know of that finds that theres a bad effect from these.  So theres a lot of people that looked at this in many different ways.', \"I'm happy to\", 'Right.', 'But the promise', 'But just to respond to the National Academy of Sciences, I mean, unfortunately I think, theres a problem with government getting involved in evaluating research, and its very hard for the government to keep politics out of it.  This was a panel set up by the Clinton administration; I dont think it was unbiased', 'It was started there.  But the point is, what James Q. Wilson, whos this hack that you were referring to, and I think a lot of people would regard James Q. Wilson as probably the top criminologist in the country, he was the person who was dissenting on this.   And whatJim showed, was that if you look at every single one of the National Academy of Sciences estimates on the impact of right-to-carry laws on murder rates, every single one of their own estimates showed that right-to-carry laws reduced murder rates.   And if you looked at their other things, virtually all their other estimates for all the other types of crimes showed reductions in those also', 'There was no estimate', 'not one estimate, that the National', \"Is it true or is it not true that every regression, every estimate that they had on right-to-carry and murder showed a drop.  Is there one estimate they showed that it didn't fall?\", 'Statistically', 'Now, thats', 'Thats simply not true', 'Look', 'So the ratio', 'Yeah, youre talking about at most five a year or so, even in the high years that that is.  Look, five, itd be better if it was zero but if you look at the number of police officers who are assaulted in a year youre talking about between 16 and 20,000.   And so if youre asking, whats the rate of a police officer whos assaulted, whos going to lose control of his weapon and have it used against himand going to result in his death, its a tiny number, but even more important I think to make is a comparison to civilians, because thats partly the motivation for this.   And police officers have a much more difficult job than civilians do, a police officer cant brandish a gun, watch the criminal run away, and be satisfied that his jobs over with.  If he has to come into physical contact with the criminal, and youre much more likely to have something go wrong.   One of the benefits a civilian has, if you take a right-to-carry class to get your permit someplace, one of the things theyre going to tell you is youre not the police.  Your job isnt to go and arrest people.   The benefit that you have of having a gun, is to maximize the distance between yourself and the criminal.  If he runs away, thats basically what youre done with, and thats the reason why you had the gun.', 'Yeah', 'I hope my kids have guns', 'I mean I hope my kids have guns, when they getI mean I didnt own a gun until 1996 after Id started doing the research that I did.  As far as I know my family had never owned a gun.  But at this point, given that I believe the benefits far outweigh the risks, I think Id be disappointed if my kids didnt own a gun.', 'Right', 'No, excellent question, actually.  And, thats precisely what you want to do, you dont want to just compare across places because, you know, Idaho is different than California and England has a different underlying crime rate before they change any types of gun control laws than the United States has.   And so what youre doing in these tests is, youre precisely doing that, youre seeing how crime rates change in a state after that states adopted right-to-carry laws, and how that change is comparing to other places that didnt change their laws over that period of time.   And there are lots of other things youll do, youll see, as that state issues more permits, you know, is there a greater drop that you seeStephen Halbrook was just mentioning is the probability that a criminal may come across somebody whos able to defend themselves, is there some relationship between the increased risk that the criminal faces and, and further drops in crime.   But, you know, thats exactly the way that you want to do the test and all the tests that I do, thats precisely the type of test', '[UNCLEAR]', 'We need more data', 'On the gun buy-back issue, I dont know of one single academic study by any type of academic, that finds that they reduce any type of violent crime rate.  We could talk about that more if you want to, but   One question that keeps on coming up here, a point from the other side is that, people with concealed handgun permits, they may do bad things.  And its easy to check.  In the state of Washington youve had permits being issued since 1960. The type of incident that there was, this wounding, is the only case I know like that in the state of Washington, nobody has been convicted of murder for example in Washington thats had a concealed-carry permit, and youre talking about almost 50 years.   And you see that in state after state.  In Florida, you can go to the website for the department that issues permits, and through September 31st of this year, they had issued over 1.41 million permits to 1.41 million people.  Of those people, 166 had had their permits revoked for any type of firearms violation. Virtually all those were for one type of violation, that was someone who accidentally carried a concealed handgun into a gun-free zone like an airport or what have you', '[UNCLEAR]', 'Can I answer that', 'Okay, thank you.  Even across countries, there are countries in the world that have more gun ownership than occurs in the United States, you have Switzerland, for example, you have which has one of the lowest', 'traditionally one of the lowest murder rates in Europe.  You have Israel, which probably has the highest gun possession rate in the world and yet, traditionally has one of the lowest murder rates in the world.  There are lots of things that affect crime rates across places.  If you look in the United States, 50 percent of the counties in the United States have zero murders in any given year.  25 percent of the counties have one murder.  Over 70 percent of the murders in the United States are concentrated in just over 3 percent of the counties, those counties represent over 20 percent of the population but they get over 70 percent of the murders.   And yet if you look across it, its the counties without any murders that have by far the highest gun ownership rates, its the, its the few percent that have 70 percent where you have by far the lowest gun ownership rates.   So, I mean there are lots of things that are going on there, there are drug gangs that I think populate these high-crime urban areas thats a real problem.  And one can go and talk about the problems there, thatll be a different subject to go into.  And', 'Thank you all again very much for inviting us here, its a great pleasure to be here.  You know, there are a lots of things that affect crime.  I thinkas I said before I think police are the single most important factor.  But we can deal with numbers on a lot of these things, we have anecdotal stories, the police chief just went through some.   I advise you, you can go and check these things out.  The Florida department ofof issuing these concealed handgun permits has detailed records, you can go to their website.  The Texas Department of Public Safety, if you just Google Texas Department of Public Safety, concealed handguns, theyll go through year by year, and tell you how many permit- holders have been convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol.   And youllits an incredibly tiny number, that this happens.  Im not saying its zero.  But the rate at which people lose their permits for any type of firearms-related violation, he gave examples of that, you look, state after state, its hundreds or thousands of one percentage point.   Off-duty police officers in Florida, were arrested and convicted at higher rates by about four times greater than concealed-carry permit holders were arrested in Florida during the same period of time.  And I want to respond to John Donohues comments about D.C.   Its not true whether you look at rates or you look at numbers that youre going to see the murder rates fall or robbery rates fall after D.C.s handgun ban.  It goes up in either case.  It just goes up more with the rate, and withwhen he says it falls what happens is, when youre just looking at the numbers, the numbers are falling quickly before the ban, and rising relatively slowly after,  and what he does is compare the before average, and the after average, and that makes it look like the before average is higher than the after average, so it looks like, well, its fallen, but its just the average, if you look at year by year, you use its falling slowly and then rising faster afterwards.   Theres no way you can break down these numbers, and not see that D.C., Chicago, England, Jamaica, Ireland, other countries which have banned guns have not seen increases in violent crime rates afterwards.   And D.C. just didnt rise relative to what it was before, it went from being 15th [REPEATING WARNING TONE] to one or two in the country.']\n",

      "['Thank you very much, its an honor to be here, its an honor to be talking about this extremely important topic.  I might object to, excessive levity and discussions of Marx Brothers and so forth, in regard to a war that has cost the lives of many thousands of people, I actually think this issues a little more serious than that frankly.   Without meaning to spend my time taking on directly the comments that were just made Im going to mention a couple of errors of fact. Electricity production is higher than pre-war levels in Iraq, that is a fact.  The country is not 80 percent Shia, although Im sure that some of the Shia parties would like to believe that.  But it absolutely is not.    And is life worse than under Saddam, well, that depends on who you are.  And, this has definitely been a traumatic, miserable experience for the Iraqi people.  I am in full agreement with the assertion that the Bush administration planned for the war badly, conducted the war badly, lived in denial for years.   I was on record for all of that time, criticizing the strategy that was being pursued, criticizing the administrationI get it.  Its also irrelevant, to the point at hand. And its unfortunate in our national discourse, that we spend so much of our time refighting the issue of whether or not this was a good idea, and not enough time talking about where we are, where were headed, what our interests are, and whether we are likely to be able to achieve them. Which is from the standpoint of a decision-maker, the only thing that matters.  And particularly since, President Bush, will not be running for office again, the question of his wisdom or un-wisdom in ordering this war, is something that can be safely left to the historians at this point.  So, the question is where are we now, and the question the motion has put is, are we winning the war. I would like to amend the motion to say, America and the Iraqis Are Now Finally Winning.   Because one of the things that has gone unnoticed, is that, a tremendous portion of the fighting that was done over the past 18 months was done by Iraqis.  Including the 100,000 Iraqi security forces that came on line, in a year, trained in contact with the enemy, marched directly into the fight against the enemy, both Sunni and Shia, and defeated the enemy across the board with American assistance of course.  It was a remarkable thing. One of the most remarkable instances of this, was when Prime Minister al-Maliki ordered the Iraqi security forces to clear the city of Basra, which was under the control of enemy groups of one sort and another.   And, the initial operation was a disaster. We worked hard to help him fix it, he worked hard to fix it, and one of the things that he did to fix it, was to order the quick reaction force of the First Iraqi Army Division, to reinforce.   That division is based in Anbar.  It is a heavily Sunni division.  It marched into Basra, where there are virtually no Sunni, and immediately began fighting against local militias and criminals. There were no instances of sectarianism, either by that formation or against that formation.   It was accepted, as the legitimate military force of the government of Iraq, acting against criminals and enemies of Iraq.  As an instance of reconciliation, and what this government means to Iraqis now, there are few cases that could be more poignant than that. That formation remained in the south, it continued to fight right up to the Iranian borderwhich also sent a message to Iran by the way.  And as we talk about how Iran has been strengthened by this war, we need to talk about how Iran has been dealt a tremendous defeat, by the destruction of its key proxy in Iraq, Muqtada al-Sadrs Jaysh al-Mahdi, which organization was militarily defeated, and has now largely disbanded politically as well.   Muqtada himself is in disgrace, and the Iranians are scrambling, and hoping, that we will take council of our despair and leave Iraq to its fate.  The question will be putwas this war worth it.  I would submit, that thats a slightly different question from whether we are winning or not and we can parse the semantics of this any way you like. As a military analyst which is all that I am, I can tell you, the trend lines now, are positive.  The importance of the elections law that was just passed, passed most Americans by.  It is a watershed event.  And I can tell that, because Ive had in the past few weeks, conversations with senior politicians, senior Iraqi military leaders, Im sorry, senior Iraqi politicians, Sunni and Shia, and before that law was passed, they were very grim, and very gloomy, and so was I.   After that law was passed, the nature of the conversations that I had with these gentlemen, changed entirely.  And instead of the gloom and doom, we had, almost wistful conversations [WARNING TONE] about, how Iraq will form itself into a country.   How the Sunni and Shia will work together, what the relationship between Arabs and Kurds will be, and they also all made to me an interesting point. They said, you know, Iraq will be a rival to Saudi Arabia.  A rival in oil, and also, a threat to Saudi Arabia because Iraq will be a democracy.  And Iraq will pose a challenge to authoritarian regimes around the region, and Iraq will be aligned with the United States.  They were telling me that.   Now I believe that thats true, and I believe that it is attainable, and I think that the evidence shows that, and I think that, if we are in fact headed in that direction and we can in fact make that happen, then, this war will have been worth fighting.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', \"I'm troubled by the notion that you can simply dismiss the entire question of whether were winning or not by saying that the sum cost is already so high that nothing we could do could conceivably make it worthwhile.  Which is rather an intellectual cop out in my opinion.  It strikes me that, um, one still has to ask the question, what is the situation that we face, and what are the probabilities of obtaining our objectives?  I would say, although I'm fully in agreement with you about the mistakes that were made, I believe that we have actually obtained many of the goals that youve just laid out.  We clearly have a disagreement about the facts.  I do believe that Iraq is being stabilized.  With all respect, Sir Malcolm, I do not think that it is likely that you will see violence suddenly explode again, unbeknownst to us. Because when you make it your mission to go around Iraq on a regular basis, and to see whats going on in the particulars, rather than having this conversation from thirty thousand feet about Sunni and Shia who dont like each other and are killing each other, and so forth, what you will see is that violence in a particular area results from circumstances in a particular area, there are larger issues of course, but it is astonishing how fractal the complexity of this country is.   And the fact that, what I would like to do is have a conversation with you region by region, area by area, and talk about what had been generating violence, why its not there anymore, and why I think that it will not be coming back anytime soon in that form.  That's how life really works. And that is what we see on the ground.  And we see a government forming that is increasingly seen as legitimate by its people, which is astonishing.  We see elections coming up that have galvanized and excited the Iraqi people like few things before.   And the astonishing thing is having spoken with Iraqi political leaders, Sunni, Shia, and Kurds, they all think that efforts will be made to rig the elections.  They all think that some of those efforts will succeed, and they all expect to abide by the results of the elections.  In my mind, thats a very healthy understanding of what democracy is likely to be like. [LAUGHTER]\", 'Yes, they have', \"I'm sorry, thats just false.  Refugees have returned.  If you say, have any refugees returned, the answer is yes.\", 'If you say', \"Are people leaving, thats fine, we can have that conversation. But there have been refugees returning, there have been IDPs returning as well.   This is a process that has been, that is ongoing, and I'm sorry, you have to, you have to recognize that. This is not the case where people are still fleeing the countries in droves, and thats all thats going on.  Youve got movement back and forth.  One of the most important things thats happened is that key leaders in Anbar, who had fled because of the al Qaeda violence, have returned. That was a key element of the Sakwa [PH], they have come back and taken up their traditional positions in society, which is one of the things that has allowed the creation of a new political dynamic in what had been the hot bed of the Sunni insurgency, and they are now participating in the Iraqi political process.  Those returnees may be small in number, but they are incredibly important for the future of the country.\", 'There is.', 'There is.  There is.', 'Thats not what were saying', 'And that is not the case.  Electrical generation and transmission in Iraq is higher, in fact significantly higher than it was before the war.', \"Well actually, I'm going to start off.\", \"I, its interesting, I just had the, this similar conversation with a senior Iraqi military leader last night, in fact.  And he made a point that the flight of the middle class in Iraq, and the technocratic class began, in fact, with the rise of Saddam, when you had a tremendous number of highly educated people flee the country.  It certainly was exacerbated as the Baathist elements and the Sunni community, elements of the Sunni community, and also Shia community, there were Shia Baathists, we tend to forget that, fled.  Are those people coming back?  On the whole, no, they're not coming back.  Will they?  It remains to be seen. Whats going on is the formation of a new government in Iraq.  It certainly was set back by mistakes that we made early on, the excessively harsh de-Baathification policy.  On the other hand, there is an analogy to the de-Nazification strategy after World War II, and there was a lot of controversy about that.  If you want the people who will administer the country efficiently, then going back to some of the people who were involved in the previous dictatorship might make sense.  Although I would point out that that was the most corrupt and inefficient and ineffective dictatorships that there has ever been at everything except keeping itself in power and threatening its neighbors.  And so its not as though there was exactly good governance in Iraq before 2003, and its not as though there was a large cadre of government officials in Iraq before 2003 who you would have wanted to see in senior positions now.  Nevertheless, excessive de-Baathification set the process back.  What we are seeing now is the construction of a new Iraqi society.  This will take a long time.  And I think part of the problem that we have in this discussion is that we tend to conflate the question, are we winning, with the question, have we won?  The truth of the matter is, we are winning in the sense that, we respect, Sir Malcolm, not just in the matter of military arena, but in respect to politics, and also now finally economic development, we are moving in the right direction, we do see the formation of an Iraqi bureaucratic class.  We do see the development of Iraqi technocrats, small in number, ineffective in some respects, still learning the ropes as they develop a new system, but we are making progress.  We will have achieved, when we have achieved the aim of working this all out, we won't be winning, we will have won.\", \"Id actually like to surprise the audience by agreeing with the last remark that Mr. Ferguson made.  It is too soon to tell.  If we win the war, then the sacrifice will not have been in vain.  I think its fair to say that no soldier who sacrifices his life, or her life for their country, makes a vain sacrifice.  But, and I dislike that, I dont think that thats really the issue, because I dont think that the nature of the sacrifice should be bound up with our judgements about whether the war is successful or not.  It is too soon to tell.  The funny thing about a war is that its not over until its over, and what seems like a good idea in year one can seem like a very bad idea in year three, can seem like a very good idea in year ten, can seem like a very bad idea in year fifty.  And thats why you can't make a permanent decision and stamp it in stone as those speaking against the motion would basically like to do.  Theyd like to say, this, the sum cost in this war is so high that nothing that could conceivably happen would be worth it, therefore the war was a failure, and lost.  And Bush is a word that I can't use on the air.  And the problem is the story doesn't end there.  The question is, what will happen in the years to come, and we dont know.  Right now it appears to me that the trends are positive to have quite a profound impact on the Middle East.  And what impresses me is that it is Iraqis who are engaged in this process actively, who are saying so.  And this isntIm not talking about Ahmed Chalabi and other folks like that whove been discredited.  Im talking about people who are actually engaged day to day, in running their country.  This is what theyre saying.  If that is in fact the case and I think that it is, then, not only will those deaths not have been in vain asas no military deaths are, but they will have served a tremendous interest of the United States of America and the world.\", 'Id just like to make a point that has been lost in this discussion so far which is to begin with, there was a small al-Qaeda presence in Iraq before 2003, thats an established fact.  Abu Musab al-Zarkawi was already in Baghdad in 2002.  I do not regard that as sufficient justification for invading Iraq, I dont think that.  Im not trying to make that case, I am stating a fact that there was an al-Qaeda presence in Iraq before we invaded. Al-Qaeda then took advantage of our failed strategy and our inappropriate methods and the variety of the mistakes that have been highlighted here, repeatedly, to seize control in Anbar Province, and areas of Ninewa and particularly Salahaddin Province and areas of Diyala and of course Baghdad. What has been lost, is that, Iraq is now the first place in the Muslim world, where a Sunni Arab population, that had embraced and supported al-Qaeda and provided fighters to its ranks, rose up against al-Qaeda, joined with the military of the United States of America,  fought tooth and nail to defeat the insurgents, threw them out of their country, and now you can hardly find an Iraqi anywhere, who will say anything other than, al-Qaeda are foreigners, theyre evil, theyre bad people and we will never let them back into our country.   If you want to talk about effects in the war on terror, this is an unintended consequencelet us say.  Its not as though there was an al- Qaeda group in Iraq that was large that we went in and defeated. However.  If you watch what the jihadis say, if you watch the al- Qaeda websites, nothing that has happened in the past seven years has distressed them more, with the exception of losing Afghanistan initially  Nothing has distressed them more than the awakening movement in Iraq which they see as a mortal threat to the success of their ideological movement within the Muslim world, and I think its very important to recognize that.', 'With due respect, I dont denigrate what you saw when you were there, but I have also spoken with many people who participated in that operation, shortly after it occurred.  And they did not simply disappear.  Many of them were killed.  And, many of them particularly in Sadr City where they fought harder, were killed. And many of their top leaders were killed, which is one of the key reasons why they broke.  And if you look at what is actually going on within the Shia community now, and you look at what Sadr has done, and you ask the question, are there Sadrist networks that remain in Iraq, the answer is, of course there are.  Then the next question, will they take Sadrs order, if Sadr tells them to rise up again and do this or do that or the other thing, and what we have seen repeatedly is, the answer is, yes and no, but increasingly more no than yes.   For the excellent reason that they have come to fear, not only the American military, but also the Iraqi army.  And, there was an interesting and very poignant moment, when some of those actually I think it was probably Iranian special groups rather than Sadrists who did thisspray- painted on a bridge, across the border into Iran, Well be back. And the Iraqi army, Iraqi army soldiers spray-painted right under it, Well be waiting.  And that message has gone out.  And so Im sorry, it simply is not the case that Sadr is just waiting us out, Sadrs son has said for the moment it may rise again, hes a young man, well see.  What will not happen, is that you will have an uprising on the scale of 2004, 2005 or even 2006 when the Sadrists were poised to take control of the country.', 'Thats not [UNCLEAR]', \"Id like to take a minute to address one of the historical myths that seems to me to be embedded in this backward-looking definition of whether were winning or not.   Which is, how exactly was Iraq doing in the 1990s after the liberation of Kuwait which was generally agreed to be a good war, led to an international- sanctions regime, led to an oil-for-food program that became incredibly corrupt, not only on the Iraqi side which was to be expected, with Saddam Hussein, but also on the UN side unfortunately.   Which created significant problems, and Ive heard Iraqis explain to me, even now, some of the problems that are persistent in the corruption that you see in Iraq date back to structures and practices that were established under the oil-for- food program.   Iraq was not exactly a wonderful buffer against Iran in the 1990s when we, the United States and Great Britain were compelled to maintain forces which looked like forever, in that circumstance, conducting overflight and periodically bombing Iraq.   And there was no end in sight to that particularly either, now, if you think that this war is going to drag on and be miserable for decades obviously it was preferable to do what we were doing in the 90s than that.  If you think that theres a prospect as I do of actual success, then, this is something that can end, in a way that that wasnt, but the notion that we were the ones who destroyed in 2003 a very effective system of dual containment I think is problematic.   But Id like to answer the question that was asked, because its an excellent question.  And I think as an analytical matter, its something thats very important to put on the table, and Im willing to put this on the table, and Im willing to be judged against this and you can throw this up to me two or three years hence, and we can talk about whether it worked out.   What would make me change my mind about the analysis?  To begin with, I already changed my mind. As I told you, I had been fairly pessimistic going into the passage of the provincial election law.  Ive changed my view as a result of that.  If the provincial elections are not held, are not seen to be legitimate, or badly marred by violence, that will be a very negative indicator, and it will make me revise my view.  If the subsequent Council of Representative elections are not held, are not seen to be legitimate, or badly marred by violence, that will be a very important negative indicator.  If the Sunni Arab community in Iraq decides that it is not going to participate in the political process in these elections, in subsequent elections, or in any way thereafter, that will be an extremely negative indicator, and well have to revise our view.  If the Iranian backed and controlled special groups are able to reestablish themselves in a coherent fashion through the country and conduct the sort of coherent, widespread campaigns that they were able to conduct before the surge, that will be a negative indicator.  If a Sunni-Arab insurgency reforms coherently to conduct large scale attacks, and I'm distinguishing that, because I'm not claiming that Iraq will be a paradise.  There will continue to be violence, there will continue to be inter-sectarian violence, there will continue to be ethnic violence, and there will continue to be terrorism.  The question is, is there a coherent enemy organization on the Sunni or Shia side running it.  If al Qaeda actually returned and reestablished significant safe havens, I would say that that was an extremely, uh, negative indicator. And lastly, if large scale, as distinct from periodic, as I say, smaller scale violence and terrorism, if large scale violence between Kurds and Arabs erupts, that will be a very negative indicator. Right now I would say I'm most concerned about the elections, about their legitimacy, particularly of the COR elections, after weve drawn down even more forces.  I think the reestablishment of special, Iranian Baath special groups, is ongoing, and we will have to see how that plays out.  The other, other indicators right now seem to me to be pretty positive.  But I think thats, those are the things that I would look at to evaluate as we move forward.\", \"Thank you.  Id like to start by noting for the record that a number of people left, and I have psychic abilities, and I know that all of those people would now vote for the proposition, and I hope that their votes will be counted.  [LAUGHS] Look, vote however you want to vote  Let me step back from that for a minute and just say, this issue is too important for us to continue to be the bird that flies backwards, always looking at where it was, and never looking to where its going.  And I'm deeply distressed by the tendency in our political class, our political discourse, and unfortunately the presidential race as well, to focus again and again on re-fighting mistakes that every single person up here agrees were made. And every single person up here criticized.  The issue is not did we make mistakes.  The issue is, where are we now, and where are we headed?  And that is what we need to focus on as a nation, because the world will not stop and stand still while we flagellate ourselves, or as some of us flagellate others, for mistakes that were made, and we cannot go through the entirely self-referential exercise of beating ourselves up for what we did wrong, and assume that the world will wait till we get through that, and then do something.  The stakes are too high, and we can't have a conversation like that. As for effect on the region, let me simply end with a little story.  I went to the border post opposite Mehran, which has a major Quds Force base in Iran.  And I stood on the border and I spoke with an American officer who, every day, met with and spoke to some of the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Iranian pilgrims who come to Iraq every day to go to the holy shrines of Najaf and Karbala, and in Baghdad.\", 'OK.  They say three things to him', 'This is ten seconds.  Thank you, we love America, and come visit us soon.']\n",
      "['Thank you very much.  Appreciate that nice introduction. Somewhat accurate, somewhat inaccurate.  [LAUGHTER]  Its always great to be back in my hometown, New York City.  I dont need much excuse to come here, I love this place.  Even though I spent most of my adult life in other places.   But it always has been home, even though I dont live here, I live in Washington, D.C.  I come here for the Metropolitan Opera and my beloved Yankees.  I know Ive probably alienated half the audience now, Im not supposed to do that.  [LAUGHTER]   But Im delighted to be here and obviously this is an important subject and one that Fred and I have been very much involved in for a couple years. My involvement in Iraq goes back to 2003 when I was on active duty and, I visited Iraq right after the invasion, and shortly left active duty.  I joined Secretary Rumsfelds policy board at his request with Henry Kissinger and Newt Gingrich and Tom Foley and Freddy Clay, a bunch of others.   And Iraq became an increasingly more important subject for us, as the war unfolded before our eyes and the challenges that we were facing.  In 2006, I parted company with the administration and the Pentagon over the war in Iraq, because I thoughtI believed our strategy was failing. I took that message to Secretary Rumsfeld, and also the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Peter Pace, and had devised a new strategy to help promulgate that.  While I was in the throes of developing that strategy I met Fred Kagan, over at the American Enterprise Institute, and he put together a planning group that was looking at the war and a new strategy, and we found that, our ideas were exactly the same.   And eventually, with others, and I may say others, that had some influence on the President of the United States to admit, that the strategy was failing, and it needed to be changed.  I tell you that because, I knew what failure looked like.  And I think so did you.  And I also know what the word winning, or success looks like in Iraq, its been a stunning achievement in Iraq, somewhat unprecedented in the history of counterinsurgency warfare, for such a dramatic turnaround in such a short period of time. And that stunning achievement thatyou are generally familiar with it.  But its based certainly on a new strategy, but its also based on the premise that security was a necessary precondition for political and economic progress.  We had never had that, as a staple, before we tried to do it complementary among those three issues, and that blew up and failed.   Thats the reality of it.  So we had to get security if we were gonna make political progress and that is a stunning achievement, in such a short period of time.  Zero ethno-sectarian violence.   All of the violence dramatically down 60 to 80 percent depending on the category, I wont go into the details of all of that, some of you are familiar with it but its quite remarkable.  Most of the time, we go to Iraq every few months, about every three months for two weeks at a time, we spend most of our time with the Iraqi people. Out on the streets where they are, in the schools, in their hospitals, seeing what life was like, in 2006, no children going to schools, hundreds of people being killed every week, people not going to their jobs, only going to marketplaces to seek provisions on an emergency basis.   Terrorized and intimidated, a country fracturing, heading towards civil war, it was not a civil war, and a possibly failed state.  The conditions in Iraq today and gradually improving over 2007 and 2008 are a dramatic difference. Schools, all schools, are open, in Iraq.  Primary, secondary, and 27 colleges, universities and technical colleges that they, they have in Iraq.   The marketplaces are teeming, theres a social fabric in Iraq thats taken place in the evening, or on the days off when people are visiting zoos and whats left of museums and, the, the natural rhythm of life is returning to the people of Iraq. Iraq is all about its people, in my judgment, so that is why we spend so much time understanding what happened to them, and what is now happening to them.  And its fascinating to see.  The security situation dramatically improved because the mainstream Sunni insurgents who started the war have capitulated.   They have surrendered.  They are coming into the political process, to achieve their political objectives.  And that is a dramatic turnaround and thats how insurgencyeither insurgencies end when they walk away and leave the field of battle or they come into the political process.   The al-Qaeda have been operationally defeated.  They no longer threaten the legitimacy of the regime. They cannot mount a sustained campaign to do that.  They dont have the infrastructure or the networks to do it.  Shia extremism, has had a major setback supported by the Iranians, and as time appears to be playing out for us, it appears that its going to be a major defeat as well. The impact on the political process, is extraordinary, theres a rising political class in Iraq, that we have seen.  Every place you go in Iraq, people are interested in the political process. Participating in it, there are 500-plus parties in Iraq.   I mean, we struggle with these two that we have.  [LAUGHTER]  To say the least.  Can you imagine what its like.  The youth in Iraq, and weve attended some of their party meetings, its wonderful to see their energy and their motivation and to participate in something thats all new to them.  A fledgling democracy.   Its fascinating to see this taking hold in Iraq.  The national legislative [WARNING TONE] benchmarks, 18 of them have been  Only one out of the 18 has not succeeded, and that is really, quite dramatic. The political reconciliation that has taken place in Iraq is very real, the most recent one is the Provincial Election Law, which will redefine Iraq, it is a seminal event.  Power will be shared, and diffused in the provinces, the people will get better services as a result of it, they will have their own budgets, they will have a place to go to express their grievances and their needs.   Iraq will never be the same again as a result of what is gonna take place in January of this year.  Less than three years after this government, as inefficient as it has been at times and ineffective as it has been at times, when you draw back from it, it has been a remarkable movement towards what the premise is here. Success in Iraq, success [REPEATING TONE] in Iraq for them, and success in Iraq for us. [APPLAUSE]', \"I think coming to an end is a condition that enables us to make political, and eventually economic progress.   And that is why its so important, because we could not do that with the hell and chaos that was taking place in that country.  The political progress is dramatically real.  If you just listen to what he Shia dominated government that Sir Malcolm just wipes away as, as not having any intention of building a better Iraq, this government has passed a de-Baathification law which changes the very social fabric of life in Iraq.  Its equivalent to our civil rights legislation, which took us a hundred years past the end of the Civil War.  It permits the Sunnis to participate in the full fabric of life where they were denied that participation by Paul Bremer and our policy back in 2003.  The Shia dominated government passed an amnesty law which will free thousands of Sunnis from jail, who were trying to kill that government and return to power themselves.  They have done that.  Why have they dont that?  Why have they made that decision?  They made that decision because they know that they have to reconcile with the Sunnis and with those who wanted to regain power if they're going to have a future.  That is a courageous decision that theyve made, even given the limited political experience that many of these leaders have had who have been thrust into these positions in the last three years as, where there was thirty-five years of autocratic repression in this, in this country.  That is dramatic change that is taking place in Iraq, and it has to give you a sense of hope.  Our objectives are pretty clear, and were well on our way to achieving them.  We want a government in Iraq that is elected by its people.  That has already taken place, and will be reinforced by the provincial elections which will further defuse that, and make it even a more powerful political model.  There will be also national elections in 2000, at the end of 2009.  We want a country that is stable and secure and capable of protecting its people.  And that is taking place, and is not a threat to its neighbors.  We do not want it to be a haven for radicalism in the region, to be sure.  And that has been rid of.  They came there because of our presence, to be sure, but also Saddam Hussein attracts radicalism.  And I'm not re-fighting why we went into the war, I'm trying to deal with what we have here, and the opportunity that is front of us in terms of what our realistic objectives are.  We have a country that wants to be aligned with us, that wants a strategic political relationship with us, that crosses education, political, cultural, educational ties.  They do not want that kind of relation with the Iranians, they want it with the United States of America.  Therefore, we will have the opportunity to have that kind of a strategic relationship with a duly elected government, the only government of its kind in the region, an Arab-Muslim country that has a duly elected government, and is aligned with the United States, and is a clear buffer against a threat in that region, which is radicalism, and particularly in the Iranians.  It already is a buffer, and it will be a greater one as this country continues to mature.\", 'Fred is going to start off.', 'Let me add to that.', \"Because some of you may be thinking about that.  When we talk about a long struggle in Iraq, we do not mean a long troop presence in Iraq.  All of us believe, strongly, that we will reduce our forces in 2009, well even more dramatically reduce them in 2010, and I have held the view, if you put Malikis number on the table, number and date on the table with Obamas, McCains, and Petraeuss, they wouldn't be that far apart.  And I think thats where we are, to be quite frank about it.  In terms of our combat forces coming out.  Because their presence is needed right now to see through the political process, to make certain that these provincial elections are not maligned, and to make certain that the national election is not maligned.  We dont have those large forces there because of the insurgency or because of the al Qaeda.   We want to make certain that the political process is moving forward, and the US and coalition presence in Iraq has been the glue that has been holding things together.  It is a myth that has been perpetuated, and people who perpetuate it dont know the Iraqis when they say, by pulling our forces away, somehow that would be a catalyst and a call to action for the Iraqis to do something that they're not capable of doing while were there.  We have been the catalyst and the glue that have helped them, and our presence has been very important.  And that presence is going to dramatically change in terms--it already has in terms of casualties, thatll continue to go down to almost nothing.  And also the numbers of our troops will dramatically go down over time as well.  I just want to clear that up, where you have long term political objectives in Iraq, that does not mean that were going to have combat troops in Iraq fighting in Iraq for years to come.\", 'Thethe factual basis of atrocities which exist in all wars, as it pertains to Iraq, are far lower than any experience that the United States or Western countries have normally had in wars in the past, and, to  Im not suggesting they dont exist, they exist. The difference is this also.  Is that, when the United States and its Western allies, when their soldiers do wrong and harm others, theres accountability for that.  Those soldiers and those leaders that are involved in that, are brought very quickly into a judicial process for accountability, thats what a democracy does, and thats what we have always been doing throughout our history, were not perfect in this.   But its certainly, that is, the realistic issue here is the fact that they have been committed, but they are much lower than our experience has been on a per-capita basis, and always, theres been accountability for that horror when its inflicted and when the chain of command is, is made aware of it', 'and it ignores the overwhelming good and sacrifice and compassion, that we have seen our soldiers display on a day-to- day basis, on the one, one momentputting their life right on the line for Iraqi families and Iraqi citizenry, and then in the next moment, having tremendous compassion, and helping and assisting them with', 'the values of the country', 'Well, Ill start it off.  One is the Provincial Election Law itself, which was the most crucial in our view, because its decentralized government and its empowering people at local levels, and theres a lot of that there right now, but now itll be formalized and itll be a structure for them to vote for, and a structure for them to receive budget money from as well.  Thats number one. Certainly, theres issues that surround the Kurds.  Theres Article 140, I dont wanna get into the details of it because we dont have enough time.  And that is of a concern for us in the future, were notFred and I are not suggesting that there are not challenges ahead in Iraqof course there are.   But the good news that we are bringing to you is that theres been significant progress here, and weve moved into another phase.  Were moving out of a security phase into a political phase, where people are using the political process to address their grievances as opposed to armed violence, and thats what we have to be hopeful for.   I dont think that could be turned back easily.  And certainly, the second thing that would concern me are the Iranians themselves, they are up to huge mischief here.  This is of significant strategic interest, their number-one strategic interest in Iraq, is the removal of the United States.  They want a weak central government in Iraq, so that they can have influence over that government.  And that is their strategic interest when it pertains to Iraq, not the region itself.  Brigadier General Suleimani, who was the Quds force commander, who engineered the operation in Iraq, in southern Iraq on behalf of the Iranians, he is the Quds force commander, who defeated the Israelis in southern Lebanon.  He has been in his position over 10 years.  He is intelligent, experienced, and ruthless.  He works for one person, and one person only, and thats the Supreme Leader of Iraq.  Of Iran, excuse me.  Despite the major setback that we have had in the south, for that leader and for his forces, his proxy forces, he is still in command.', 'As weve tried to indicate, Iraq, weve tried not to re-fight the beginning of the war in Iraq, because that was not the purpose here.  Well also have opinions about that ourselves.  And we have admitted openly that we had a failed strategy in Iraq for three plus years.  But we do have a winning strategy now.  And I look at Iraq as an opportunity.  It is clearly in the United States national interest to have an Arab Muslim country with a duly elected democratic government aligned with the United States in a region of the world, like it or not, that we will spend the next thirty to fifty years involved in.  And it will continue to be ideological and serious struggles there.  This is a step forward for the national security interests of the American people to have that kind of a relationship with a stable government.  We are not there yet, but the signs are clearly there, and they were not there in the past.  And with the investments that we are making in resources, and in, certainly with our soldiers commitment, and yes, with their lives, that is absolutely worth the sacrifice, in my judgement, in terms of the security of the United States, and what that region, that troubled region of the world will be.  There is not a single Sunni Arab state that surrounds Iraq that will not change as a result of the stable, duly-elected democratic government in that country.  And the Iranians will have to change and be influenced by it as well.  And that is the opportunity that is in front of us, and that is why we are so committed to it.  And regardless of all the mistakes in the past, that is in front of us right now.']\n",

      "[\"Thank you.  Actually, I'm not a surgeon, I am just an ER doc, and I dont have the distinguished background of my fellow panelists, but I have treated thousands of patients, insured and uninsured, and Ive also broken bad news to hundreds of families.  I want to tell you about one of them that Ill never forget.  It took them two hours to reach Atlanta from the north Georgia mountains.  I faced them across the outstretched body of their son.  The ventilator hissed rhythmically, ten breaths per minute.  I spoke first.  Your son was in a terrible crash, I said.  The ambulance crew could tell he was severely injured and called a helicopter. He reached us about three hours ago.  He has several injuries, a collapsed lung, internal bleeding, but these aren't his most serious problem.  His brain injury worries us the most.  Thats when his mother interrupted me.  She said, doctor, I don't know how to ask you this, but I must.  My husband lost his job six weeks ago, I work, but my employer doesn't offer health insurance.  Is my son going to get the care he needs? Momentarily taken aback, I replied, ma'am, you're at Grady Hospital, one of the finest trauma centers in the south, I swear to you, we will do everything in our power to save your son.  I meant what I said that night, but I didn't tell her the whole truth.  I didn't tell her that our best probably wouldn't be good enough, and that if her son survived hed probably be disabled for the rest of his life.  I didn't tell her that she and her husband would be billed for the helicopter flight, and the days or weeks to come in the intensive care unit, and that the total would probably reach a hundred thousand dollars, maybe a whole lot more.  I didn't tell her that she and her husband would empty their savings and mortgage their home in an effort to pay the bill, and that it wouldn't be enough.  And that the coins put in a coffee can at the local diner wouldn't come close to covering the difference.   I didn't tell her that the unpaid balance of her sons bill will push Grady hospital closer to insolvency, closer to its own crash, and if Grady closes, north Georgia, a region of more than five million people, will lose its only level one trauma center, its only burn unit, its only poison control center, its only emergency psychiatric unit, and seven hundred and fifty inpatient beds. And thats not all.  If Grady closes, metro Atlantas private hospitals, already overburdened by population growth, will topple like dominos one after another.  Ladies and gentleman, for me this debate is not an idle intellectual exercise, its about lives. Three hundred million American lives.  I support this resolution for three reasons.  First, because our failure to cover every American is a national disgrace.  Second, because well never achieve universal coverage if we dont make health care in this country more affordable.  And third, because the only way we can make health care more affordable and cover everyone is through a well-regulated health care marketplace, and to do that the Federal Government must be involved.  Now let me be clear, the majority of Americans do not want a government-only health care system, but they absolutely want the government involved, as a referee, as a cop, to make sure that everybody plays by the rules. The other side of this debate will try to convince you that rising health care costs are due to government interference.  Well, theyve got it backwards.  The problem is not government interference with the health care industry, the problem today is health care industry interference with government.  Thats why the business of medicine is booming.  Record profits, huge executive salaries, bonuses, health care costs spiraling out of control year after year after year.  But the caring side of medicine is failing. On the front lines, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals are nearly as frustrated as you are.  The nation-wide crisis in emergency care is a case in point.  Every major challenge we face, ERs packed with patients, dangerously long waits to be seen, a half million ambulances a year turned away to more distant hospitals, and fewer specialists than ever willing to take ER call.  All of them are due to the fact that the economics of health care encourage hospitals to favor elective cases over emergency cases.  Good for business, bad for patients. And its terribly expensive.  Country music star Dolly Parton once quipped, you have no idea how much it costs to look this cheap. [LAUGHTER]  The same can be said about American health care. You have no idea how much it costs to run this poorly.  We spend two trillion dollars a year on health care, and a trillion dollars is a lot of money.  Put this in perspective, a million seconds ago was last week.  A billion seconds ago Jimmy Carter was inaugurated president.  A trillion seconds ago was thirty thousand BC.  For two trillion dollars we can take good care of everybody in this country and have a lot left over, and you dont have to look outside the US for proof.  If everybody practiced medicine as efficiently as they do in Rochester, Minnesota and Salt Lake City, Utah, Medicare could pay thirty percent less to doctors and hospitals, and everybody would get better care.  But it won't happen on its own, because one persons waste is another persons revenue stream.  That's why we need a cop on the beat, and the only cop with the clout to get the health care industry to play by the rules is the federal government.  My side has given you several reasons to vote for tonights resolution, but the most compelling one of all is your own self interest, because a health care system that doesn't work for everyone may not work for you when the chips are down.  Take it from me, an ER doc, no one can predict when a life threatening emergency may strike, but if it does, youll want your hospital to go the extra mile, not your ambulance. [APPLAUSE]\", \"We had a lot of talking about cars earlier, and, I think everybody is familiar with the economic problems that GM is having right now, and actually I think GMs cars are better than Trabant. But they're carrying about five billion dollars a year in health care costs.  Several years ago the CEO at GM testified before Congress and said two billion dollars out of their bottom line every year was just for drugs.  Now meanwhile, Pfizer, the second largest pharmaceutical company in the United States, last year reported nineteen billion dollars in profit, thirty-seven percent profit margin.  Now, Im a big believer in market economics too but I dont want our auto industry to wind up in Ontario, Id like to keep a lot of it in Michigan.  So I dont understand, I mean I do think profit is good but I think when one industry can basically drive another one into the ground and harm our country, regulation is outta whack, and let me justone other point.   The FDA cannot take the cost of a drug into consideration when it approves a new drug, it just has to be better than nothing.  Thats not by accident. Congress prohibits the FDA from considering cost-effectiveness of new drugs.   Thats not the case in the UK, its not the case in other countries, it should not be the case here\", 'First of all I heard some real interesting comments made from the other side earlier and I just want to say, yall cant make stuff up cause none of you are running for President.  [LAUGHTER]', 'Second thing.  Sally, you mentioned about Medicare.  You know, weve had a recent experiment with private health plan efficiency, private health plans have started administering Medicare. Theyre getting paid an average of 12 percent more per enrollee, thats nearly $1000 more per person than traditional Medicare administers the same program.  This is going to add 8.5 billion to the cost of Medicare this year in 2008, and since 2004, those plans will have sucked an extra $33 billion out of Medicare trust fund, without improving the care to beneficiary, so, again, Michael, I think youre right, we got a lotta people that have gotten their hands around the federal till, and have made federal government a cash cow.  I think federal government needs to be a watchdog.', 'I want to say one other thing', 'Can I just add', 'Thereve been so many points out here that I wish we could address, one I want to talk about is waiting times, because you hear that all the time.  The waiting times that matter, are the waiting times for things like, when you go to the ER and how quickly you see a doctor for a heart attack.   How quickly you get stroke care.  Whether or not if youve got acute or worrisome symptoms you can see your doctor that day or the next day or you end up having to be in an ER.  Were turning away one ambulance per minute in this country from overcrowded private as well as public hospitals in the United States.   If youve got to limp around for two months on a bum knee until you get a new titanium knee, Im sorry.  Thats not going to kill you.  You dont get to me for 30 or 45 minutes because youve been diverted from three hospitals, youre going to die.  Thats the waiting times that we need to worry about in the United States and its not going to happen if we ignore this problem.', 'The Mayo Clinic has a great philosophy.  Its very heavily focused on primary care, theyre very heavily focused on efficiency.  You dont have to be efficient to be successful in this country.  I just have to talk you into getting all the tests that I want you to get, I need to talk you into getting the procedures you want.   You know, we just talked about economics.  Everybody these days is complaining about gas prices with good reason.  But if we ran our oil industry the way were running our health care industry gasoline would cost $16 a gallon and one out of every six American cars couldnt burn it.  We can do better than that.', \"Have you all heard the expression that there are no atheists in fox holes?  I can tell you, in my experience, there are no libertarians in intensive care units.  [LAUGHTER]  Its widely said that Americans can pick their doctor.  The fact of the matter is, if you're in a non-group plan, or you're in a plan that doesn't contract with these doctors over here, but you can over here, every day I see patients whose care is disrupted because their plan has shifted doctors, they didn't get the deal they wanted. Weve surrendered an enormous amount of freedom in this country to the private insurance industry, and to the rest of the industry.  We can collectively together do better.  In just a few moments you're going to vote again, and the six of us care a lot about how that vote turns out.  But thats really not the vote that matters.  The vote that matters is coming up on November the 4th, and I encourage every one of you to do your homework, and do your homework on the candidates positions on health care, because they are strikingly different, and they, to some degree, break down along the lines of the debate tonight, and it should make a difference in the choice that you make then as well as the choice you make tonight.  I want to close by going back to the bedside of that family.  I didn't tell that mother the whole truth that night, but by staying silent and withholding the truth I left her with something we both needed, which is hope.  Hope that her son would beat the odds.  Sometimes we see young people come back from catastrophic injuries and do OK.  Hope that Georgia and every other state in this country would develop efficient, effective regionalized trauma and emergency care systems so everyone can have access to life saving emergency care.  And most important, hope that this great nation of ours, the United States of America, will soon finally do the right thing and cover the uninsured so no mother need ever ask again, will my son get the care he needs?  Please vote for tonights resolution. [APPLAUSE]\"]\n",
      "['Thank you.  So Im an economist which means Im supposed to talk about efficiency, but I actually want to start, by talking about morality.  And in fact I dont want to start by talking about health care.  Let me talk about something thats going on right now.   As we sit here there are several million people in the Houston metropolitan area, who are without electricity or running water. Been hit by disaster, they didnt do anything wrong.  They stayed in their houses because that was what they were advised by the governor of Texas to do, it was the right thing to do given the impossibility of evacuating a city that size and now, a lot of them are in trouble. Some of them can manage, some of them can now go and stay with relatives, some are in good health and, others are not, theyre in a lot of trouble.  Now, do we think that the people who are in trouble, who are elderly, who are in poor health, who just dont have the financial resources, whatever, to get themselves out of that situation, do we believe that, well look, you know, its not a government responsibility to help them, they should be left on their own.  Well of course we dont, I mean, I imagine there are some people who do believe that, but not many.  They certainly dont show their heads in our American politics.  We do believe that if our fellow citizens suffer misfortune that is no fault of their own, and we can help them, that we should. Now imagine, some American who is in poor health and cant afford medical care.  Some American who is elderly and in need, trouble, or maybe not elderly, somethings gone wrong, someone who is trying to work but cant get a job that has health insurance, someone who is in difficulty.   Do we believe that thats their problem, that we should not be taking care of them. And by the way, were not just talking about the 45 million without health insurance.  Were also talking about the roughly 75 million people who have inadequate health insurance.   Health insurance that basically crumples, whenever its put to the need, were talking about a large part of this country, that does not have adequate health care coverage. Well I would submit to you that actually as a nation, we dont believe that its appropriate to leave these people on their own. That we actually believe that the right thing to do is to help people, we dont think that people should be protected from all of the risks of life but when there is something you can do, we believe that we should do it.   And in fact by and large, if you ask people, should people have health coverage in this country, should people be guaranteed health care, most polls Ive seen say that a heavy majority of the public thinks that they should.  So then the question would be, well how is it that we dont actually have that, how is it that we havent actually taken care of our citizens in the way that overwhelmingly, as a nation, we believe is the morally right thing to do, that as a matter of values, we think we oughta do.   And the answer is of course that were toldwell actually were told two things.  Were told first of all, that we already do it.  That we already take care of everybody, and were also told, that its impossible to take care of everybody. Now you might think that it was impossible to believe both those things at the same time but, thats why these guys are paid the big bucks.  So were told that, well, look  And I can quote the President there.  I mean people have got access to health care in America.  After all you just go to an emergency room.   And of course--I think we probably have a fair number of doctors here right--you know, it aint the same thing.  First of all, going into emergency is no substitute for continuing care.   And secondly, if you go to an emergency room, they will bill you.  Now if youre indigent, weve got the care all the same but you will get the bill and if youre indigent maybe that doesnt matter, but, for working Americans who dont have good incomes, theyre terrified of emergency room coverage, and itstheres something sick about our debate, that anybody can even claim that the emergency room is a substitute for universal health care. But the other argument is that its impossible.  That if you try to have some form of universal health care, itll be terrible.  Itll be lousy quality, itll be wildly expensive.  So people are told that a government insurance system cant possibly work.   It will be lousy insurance, itll be awful, itll lead to awful care  Which, now were going to hear a little bit I think later on about some of the international evidence, were going to hear about other countries.   But you know, Itheres a secret, I dont know if people know about it but you know, theres this program called Medicare.  Covers every American 65 and older.  It is, horrors, its a single-payer health insurance system run by the federal government.   When it was being proposed, people said it would be terrible.  You may have heard of something called Operation Kaffeeklatsch. Or you may not have heard of it.  Doctors wives were urged to hold kaffeeklatsches, in which they would try to convince the doctors patients what a terrible idea this proposal called Medicare was, and they would play a recording by a fellow named Ronald Reagan, explaining what a terrible idea Medicare was and how it would lead, not only to destruction of health care, but actually the destruction of freedom, its quite something, you can listen to it online and, at the end, it basically says Medicare is the root to a totalitarian state.   Well, its become as American as apple pie.  Famous quote among, in the health care field is the, constituent who accosted Senator John Breaux saying, Senator, dont let the government get its hands on Medicare. The fact of the matter is we have universal health coverage for our elderly already.  The other thing that people say is that it would be impossibly expensive.  Now, the truth is, a little-known other big secret, really have to go in deep research and actually look at a couple of official statistics that are easily available to find this out  In this country, the government already pays more health care bills than private insurers do.  Medicare and Medicaid together, are already a bigger program than private insurance, all [WARNING BELL] private health insurance.  The reason is that we already cover the expensive cases.  We already have the expensive cases.  The elderly, the very sick who end up being bankrupted and therefore end up poor enough to get Medicaid are covered by public programs.  Whats left, are generally lower-income working adults, and we pay an enormous amount to not cover them.   The fact of the matter is that our health care system is wildly inefficient, largely because we have an insurance industry that devotes enormous resources to try to identify who really needs health insurance, so as not to give it to them. And we have health care providers devoting enormous resources, fighting with the insurance companies, to actually get paid.  And the result is a wildly inefficient system.  It would be cheaper, by far, to just cover everybody.  We pay this huge price because weve managed to convince ourselves, or be convinced, that somehow, something that [WARNING BELL, REPEATING] every other advanced country does, and that every otherthat we do ourselves for the elderly, is impossible.  Thank you', 'That, that', 'That came', 'That came wonderfully into exactly what I was going to say, we have had Katrina used as an example and I thought to myself as I always do it must be wonderful to be a conservative because, you can take control of the government, make a mess of things and say see, that proves my point, isnt that wonderful. [LAUGHTER]  And I would also add', 'since John Stossel  [APPLAUSE]  Since John Stossel has used vote-counting, you know, its not that the governments, this particular government isnt able to count the votes, it was sort of that they didnt want to?  [LAUGHTER]', 'Medicare has its problems, but has continued to function.  We have a well-established system, it continuesSocial Security, is a system thats working with high efficiency.  The point is to get this thing  [LAUGHTER]  It is.  If you havepay any attention it works fine.  And if you', 'And private insurance', 'And private insurance?  Thats the thing, I  Actually, can I just I wanted to ask a question.  And', 'and I wanted to ask, actually two questions, to the audience. First, how many Canadians, would Canadians in the room please raise your hands.  [ONE PERSON APPLAUDS, LAUGHTER]', 'Okay, not as many as I thought.  Okay, of those of you who are not on the panel who are Canadians,, how many of you think you have a terrible health care system.  [PAUSE]  One, two', 'Bad move on my part.  [APPLAUSE]  Ive got a selected--all right, I wont try it.  But I will say, that', 'Well, weve gotno, thats', 'gotta be honest, and', 'Yeah, no, thats definitely true.  There is, although, its not clear that were really at the point where thats the critical limitation, thatsat this point, just eliminating health care that actually does no good at all would probably be enough to save a large amount, thats what the Congressional Budget Office says, so its not a really a in the very long run, what happens when we have the $30 million immortality treatment, that sort of thing, this becomes a big problem.  Look, I just want to bringone more thing, weve been talking a lot about quality of care but theres one other thing that is very important which is the financial ruin that often comes from medical expenses.   And that is preventable and thats only in America, the individual who is finanthe family thats financially ruined.  Every time I look at one of the studies that says well we cant show that providing health insurance makes that much difference in health outcomes.  First of all I dont quite believe it but secondly, there is a tremendous difference in terms of not the medical side but the economic side and this is something again, theres a risk, a fear, a terror of medical expenses, which happens among wealthy countries only in America.', 'But thats the  No, Im not talking about bankruptcy rates, Im talking about all kinds of people', 'And you know, those are', 'the elderly, right?  The elderly', 'No, come on, there are', 'Oh, okay, can I justthis is', 'The reason you have to buy from a New York insurance company is because New York has community rating, which means that an insurance company cannot turn you down if you have a preexisting condition.  And if they throw it open, across the country, then, people who dont have a preexisting condition, people who are healthy can go shopping, and its not some kind of crazy thing because they want people to have hypnosis.', 'Its because theyre trying to protect people who would not otherwise be able to get insurance, and that gets at the irresponsibility of the arguments that are made so often', 'in this case', 'Yeah.  [LAUGHTER]  If they', 'Point of fact, I think the United States created 23 million jobs when some other guy was Presidentand actually employment growth in Europe has been faster since 2000 than the United States, so, thats a little bit out of date.', 'I dont know what', 'that 20-year periodthat 20 million figure refers to, I think that was a number just sort of plucked out of air.', 'Yeah, its not the system you would design if you were starting from scratch and its not the system we want to end up with.  But its a system that at least did the basics of risk-pooling for a lot of people, its a system that did deal with the problems of preexisting conditions and people being screened and does somewhat reduce the problem of insurance companies, not to deliver care but to, who can do the best job of finding who really needs insurance so as not to give it to them.   So its notI have no brief with that system, but, the idea that what we need to do is scrap it and move to an individual insurance market which has never worked anywhere, its the most amazing thing, that what we have coming from the conservative side is the belief that, universal health care, which works all across the world, is undoable.   And that an individual market, which has never worked anywhere, is the answer to our problems, extraordinary leap of faith.', 'Yeah, Ive seen some, but you know, we just, it', 'there just isnt enough out there', '[SIGHS]  In the course of this debate I actually feltI dont know whether the audience will agree but I actually felt that John Stossel in effect conceded, when he held up that Trabant at the end of it.  Because that just shows, if all you can do is say Communism, Communism, East Germany   I dont want us to move to East Germany.  I just want us to move to France.  Now, the  [LAUGHTER]  Lookgovernment health care isnt perfect. Actually, government health care isnt the issue, government insurance isnt perfect, so is private insurance.  There are horror stories, the nature of health care, is that lots of bad things happen.   You dont generally seek health care, because youre feeling great.  But we have extensive experience, we have Medicare, which is a system that is flawed but has actually shown slower cost inflation, than private health insurance over the past 40 years.   We have the Veterans Health Administration which is our little island of true socialized medicine in the United States.  And it does very well.  And above all, what we have is a system right now, remembering what the proposition is, the motion is that the federal government should guarantee health care.   Not that the government should run everything, not that everything should be under government control, not that we should nationalize the steel industry, which keeps on being run but as you know is not on the agenda or nationalize the auto company, but whether there should be a federal guarantee of health care for everybody.   And that, I think, is something that American values, that our fundamental morality says is something we should be doing.']\n",
      "[\"Thank you very much, John.  And Id like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared very much for inviting me to New York, Ive had a wonderful time while Ive been here.  I also have a strong personal connection to the United States, my wife is an American and I visit her family on a regular basis and see the great health care that the United States has, and the terrible health care that this country has.   And one is given to her father and one is given to her uncle, and the difference is insurance coverage.  Ive also slept overnight, I dont want to give the impression I sleep around but, Ive slept overnight in 23 US states and I have a pretty good idea of the health care system in this country as even my daughter has used it when she had a catfish spine through her palm in Florida. Now, as Paul has said, that this is very much a question of values.  And its actually a case where you can have your cake and eat it too, in fact, you can only eat your cake if you have it, in other words, you can only get cost control if youif you have equity.  And as Paul has said, as weve heard others say, the US system costs the most in the world, it denies care to tens of millions of Americans and I have seen that personally.  And the international performance and quality is just so-so.  Does this really reflect American values.  Is this really what you want out of your health care system.  In Canada, our values for health care go back to Tommy Douglas, the premier of Saskatchewan between 1944 and 1961.   And when Tommy was a boy in my hometown of Winnipeg, Manitoba, he developed osteomyalitis, an infection in his leg.  There were no antibiotics at the time, the recommendation of the doctors were that his leg should be amputated. Fortunately Dr. Robert Smith, a noted surgeon, saw Douglas, told him that because he was an interesting case, he would treat him for free if he allowed teaching students to--allowed Dr. Smith to teach with him.  Douglas was left with the impression all his life if he hadnt been fortunate enough to run into Dr. Smith and be interesting, he wouldve lost his leg.   Then a few years later, after Douglass government in Saskatchewan had implemented universal hospital insurance and universal medical insurance, despite the fact that in the 1940s being the poorest province in Canada,  Justice Emmett Hall, a Supreme Court justice in Canada, and if anything a conservative, was asked by our then- Prime Minister, John George Diefenbaker, to review our health care system.  His conclusion, was that we should move ahead with medical insurance cause we already had hospital insurance.   The main reason he gave was, efficiency.  He said that it would be a lot cheaper to have a single-payer system, than to have multiple private payers.  And so his vote was for efficiency.  And those are the values on which our system are [sic] based.  Equity and efficiency. What are the results?  Fifty years ago we had the same as your country.  We had the same health status.  We paid the same amount for health care.  Fifty years later, all Canadians are covered for hospitals and physicians service.  In the United States millions have no coverage, and tens of millions have, have inadequate insurance.  We actually get more of most services than Americans do.  We have more visits to doctors every year, more days in hospital, more days in nursing homes, we take more prescription drugs than you do.  I mean, not all of these things are good, too much health care can kill you. [LAUGHTER] But even though there are some services we dont get as much of, like nobody in the world does as much cardiac interventions as you do, the Belgians are close, but nobody really else is close, we actually do more bone marrow transplants.  We do more lung transplant surgery.  Toronto is an international center for lung transplants.  And that, far from lacking innovation, were the country that brought you insulin, we developed bone marrow transplantation.  When Paul Tsongas was telling the electorate years ago that he wouldn't have got his service in Canada, it greatly offended the two people, two doctors in Toronto who had developed the procedure. And all of this costs way less, ten percent of our GDP compared to sixteen percent in your country. How does that happen?  Well, half of the extra expense is administration, because of the extra expense of this multiple payer system.  The other half is due to higher prices because you dont have effective cost control because you dont have a single payer.  Now, this must cost us a fortune, we must be basket cases.  The Canadian Federal Government has run surpluses equal to one to two percent of our GDP for eleven years in a row. Theres no problem affording health care when you do it because you're concerned about other people.  Then you can make it affordable.  And our health status, of course, is not a true reflection, but in other, but from what youll hear, perhaps, from these panelists and others, youd imagine Canadians are dying in the street waiting for medical care.  In fact, we now live three years longer on average than you do.  This is over a fifty year period, weve now got a three year longer life expectancy.  Our infant mortality rates are twenty to thirty percent lower than yours.  And finally, its a great boon to business in our country. The province of Ontario has, the last couple of years, has been assembling more motor vehicles than any US state including Michigan.  The costs to manufacturers are nine percent of payroll for health care costs in this country, one and a half percent in Canada.  That our manufacturing center is under pressure, but it would be gone without our health care system.   So, Canada has done well, but Canada is not the outlier.  Canada is the outlier in North America.  Around the world wealthy countries, all wealthy countries that Americans would think of when they think of other countries they could live in, with a comparable standard of living, all other countries have a mainly public system.  And Canada does have problems in its system, just as every country has its problems.  Our problems are second order problems.  Weve dealt with coverage, and weve mainly dealt with affordability.  So we, we have waits and delays in Canada, they're improving, but we do have them.  But France and Germany have much shorter waits for care than you do in this country.  So, despite the individual anecdotes that you're going to hear, health care in Canada or Germany or France are remarkably similar to the US. A recent letter to the editor by Lou Holman [PH] from Rochester New York reported on his heart attack in Toronto while he was visiting, and he was having his surgery within one hour of calling the ambulance.   So, lets get serious.  Health care is pretty standard in most developed countries, we have similar problems in delivery, you are the only ones that really have problems with coverage and affordability.  So, it comes back to values.  If you focus on equity, you get a bonus.  You get cost control.  If you focus on cost control, you dont get equity or cost control.  And I strongly encourage you folks to vote for our side.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]\", 'Its  hard to tell. I', 'I', 'I think that, well, youve heard the other side say you cant trust research.  So, I guess that we just have to go on gut feeling and spin, is that right?  So that I', 'I think that', 'Sally has', 'Sally has mentioned somewell, disparaging the international research, in fact, one of the people in the audience is one of the key people doing international research, maybe she can speak for herself, as to whether or not it is useless, but I feel that', 'I feel that the international research is valuable and it shows, that by and large, other countries are delivering the same level of care, the unfortunate thing that happened to your mother, Sally, Im very sorry for that, could easily happen in the United States, it could happen in any other country.   A family doctor, who doesnt, you know, for a variety of reasons, take a particular complaint seriously, that stuff happens, the rate of medical error in all developed countries is about the same, although the studies have been done slightly differently, eight countries have done studies.  In all countries, 5 to 10 percent of all deaths are preventable deaths that occur in hospital.  So thatmodern health care has some very serious problems and isthis country in fact is a leader in looking at quality in health care.   Dr. Donald Berwick, the founder of the Institute for Health Care Improvement, is the person, the preeminent person in the world, on this issue.  But', 'but Canada doesnt have problems with coverage, and neither does Germany or France, and we dont have problems with affordability.  We have second-order problems because we havent dealt with the quality issues.', 'I think you could cut', 'You could cut taxes.', 'Thats what the Congressional Budget Office said in 1994, that adopting a single-payer system would save so much money on extra administration, and then', 'you could cover everybody.', 'And I would like to add that', 'I', 'Yeah, that in all this talk about health care with traditional economic models, that really, that is one of the main reasons why you folks have not been able to make progress.  That is, using traditional marketplace models, focused on that as your ideology to analyze health care, which is not in any way close to being a traditional economic market.   And to apply some sort of economic language the way were hearing from the other side, to a system which iswhere the supply side is massively regulated, for good reasons.  You know, do you want to be able togoing to have to look up every single provider that you see to find out whether or not they passed their licensing exams or not? You know, Ithe extension wouldof this argument would be Milton Friedmans one that, just absolutely no regulation whatsoever.  But, that', 'that doesnt deal with health care where it by and large for key decisions, consumers can never be at the same information level as the agent whos recommending those services', 'Mostmany of those folks have illnesses, and they cannot get insurance no matter how much money they pay', 'No, but', 'This', 'Health', 'health care is not a market like other markets', 'but its gotta be closer', 'to being a market like other markets', \"Yes, I want to mention that, that there is virtually no flow of Canadians south of the border.  The Canadians getting health care south of the border are, like, ninety-nine percent of them are like my daughter who had a catfish spine through her palm people on vacation.  That there is the waiting list issue, I mentioned that it is a problem in Canada, but other countries with universal systems dont have waiting list problems.  It is not a problem of universal coverage.  And in fact, in Toronto right now, because of public response to the concerns about waiting lists, if you need cataract surgery, if you need your knee replaced, if you need a hip replaced, phone one number, you can be seen in an assessment clinic within one week usually, and you can get your surgery within a month after that, and it doesn't cost you any money directly, because you pay it in your taxes, and the taxes in Canada as a share of GDP are almost as low as they are in the United States.  And weve had surpluses for eleven years.  I think what you're hearing from the other side are a whole series of anecdotes, and yet the overall research indicates that every other wealthy country in the world where you would feel comfortable visiting and living has a universal system.  And I think what you really have to watch out for is what the New Yorker commented on April 20th, 1992, referring to then the first president Bush: The compulsion that drives President Bush to distort the facts about Canadian Health Care suggests that official American policy is in the process of becoming what conservatives in discussing the Soviet Union used to call a total ideology, a system blindly convinced of its absolute truth, and yet so fragile in its relationship to reality that it isn't capable of considering even the most obvious reform.  Surely we should have learned by now what happens to ideological systems that begin to deny facts that their people can discover for themselves just by crossing a border.  Cross the border, come to Canada, anybody in the audience, contact me, I will show you the Canadian health care system, and then America should do universal coverage in its innovative fashion.  Make health care a right, and then do it right. [APPLAUSE]\"]\n",

      "['Ladies and gentlemen, I want to make the question before you as authentic and personal as possible.  Imagine that when you leave here tonight, you learn that your childs kidneys are failing and that without a transplant she will die.  The problem for you is how to obtain an organ for her.  She could receive one from a living donor, but sheand both she and the donor can live quite well with one healthy kidney.  But what if no relative or friend is both compatible and willing to donate.   Well, you look to be, a reasonably well-heeled, group, so perhaps you might pay someone to supply her this superfluous kidney, and thereby save your childs life.  Alas, that would be illegal.  You, the vendor, and anyone who aids you in this will be subjected to imprisonment. Odd, isnt it.  That if she were attacked by an assailant, you are permitted to use deadly force to save her life.  But when she is attacked by disease, you may not pay a willing vendor to provide an organ.  Perhaps this rests on the principle that the rich should not get what the poor are precluded from obtaining.   Well then. A private charity or government agency should step in and purchase organs from willing donors, and distribute them on the basis of need.  No.  That is also forbidden.  No one, no institution, no government agency may pay a living donor.  Well then, perhaps she can receive a deceased donor organ.   Yes, if she is lucky.  Now as it happens something between 25 percent and 60 percent of organs suitable for transplantation, are recovered from the deceased.  What happens to the rest.  They are buried and burned.  Why doesnt a private party or a charity or the government step in and purchase those life-saving organs. Bizarre as this may sound, the law draws no distinctions between organs from the living and organs from the deceased.  Here too, offering or accepting compensation for a deceased donor organ, is a felony.  Our position, is not that every conceivable market in human organs is ethically acceptable.   Rather, it is that at least some are.  Our opponents on the other hand, object to, and would prohibit, any and all personal reward being offered to providers of organs.  They oppose payments for living donation. They oppose payments to next of kin for the organs of a deceased relative.   They propose offering an options contract to healthy people for delivery of their organs after death.  They even oppose the life-sharer system of giving a priority to transplant organs, to those willing to make the commitment to their own deceased organ donation.   Though in this debate we are not arguing in favor of any particular proposal to reward providers, I will outline one such proposal, the one with which I am most closely associatedan options market in deceased donor organs.  I do so in part because I crafted his proposal precisely to try to accommodate every ethical objection I had heard, whether I thought it worthy or not.  I leave it to you to judge if there is any substantial ethical objection that should bar its adoption.   The market I propose is one in which healthy individuals might contract for the sale of their organs and tissue for delivery after their death.  If the vendors organs are received and transplanted, a payment in the range of $5000 for each major organ would be made to a person or institution chosen by the donor.   What of the objection to the poor being coerced by poverty to endanger their health by selling their organs?  I repeat.  In an options market, organs would only be acquired from the dead.  No one need be induced or even permitted to sacrifice his health or bodily integrity for money.   The donation of the organs of the deceased by both rich and poor is currently strongly encouraged, precisely because most of us believe that surrendering the organ represents no sacrifice to the donor.  But doesnt employing a market mean that organs will be allocated on the basis of willingness to pay, and so the rich will be able to buy organs that the poor are precluded from obtaining.   Some things it is believed are literally too vital to permit their allocation by ability to pay.  Had I the time, I would challenge this objection, and argue that there are fewer ethical problems in allowing people to sacrifice their own treasure to save the lives of those they love, than exist under allwhat I, but not my colleague Dr. Friedman, view as the self-righteous yet cramped and craven and misguided UNOS system of allocation.   But alas, time does not allow for that.  For now I must underscore that my proposed options market does not speak to the question of to whom the organs will be allocated, only how they will be acquired from the original owner and possessor.   My proposal is consistent with and can accommodate any conceivable system of acquisition and allocation, including, purchase by a government agency, allocation solely on the basis of medical criteria, and provision to recipients at no charge.   Note also, that the options market does not require next of kin to traffic in the flesh of their loved ones. Instead it is one in which people contract to sell their own organs when they are healthy for delivery after their death, thereby taking the next of kin out of the decision-making process.   The central premise not merely of my proposal, but of all the others as well, is an obvious, even banal economic proposition.  If you compensate people for something, they will provide more of it than if you dont.  Every economist who has written on the question including Nobel Prize-winner Gary Becker, has argued in favor of using personal incentives to increase the supply of transplant organs.   The price of the prohibition on the sale of human organs, is the death of many thousands of people each year.', 'Were the suffering and death of the victims of this pernicious policy more visible, the stale and empty pieties about the sacred human body being despoiled by the profane market would be revealed for the vacuous moral posturings that they are.  Such moralizing rather than reflecting an adherence to noble principles, instead bespeaks a fanatical adherence to abstract, inapposite principles, by those who are well isolated from the horrific human consequences of their folly.   It is not the payment for organs that offends human dignity, but rather the fanatical unwillingness to save thousands of lives by permitting such payments, that is a great offense to human dignity.', 'Gahhh!', 'No.  Hewell.  First of all, David, he wants you to answer a different question when you vote later.  He wants it to be the question on live kidney sales.  Well, that isnt the resolution.  The resolution is quite clear, should we legalize the market for human organs.  So he gives you the list of horribles of the worst conceivable market, and says, vote against that.   I tell you, theres a slew of possible markets, many of them quite innocent including merely a cadaveric market.  Clearly distinguishable. And that falls within this notion of a market in organs.  Now, theres no more reason to think that or I can see no particularI cant imagine a society, in which people would feel pressured, you know, to sell an organ for cash.  Its an evasion. And its just a list of horribles, that doesnt exist', 'anywhere, and that will not exist here.', 'Thats not true.', 'Ive been arguing for this for 20 years', 'Really', 'Im very [UNCLEAR]', 'So youre willing to switch sides and come to', 'this side and be with me on that one.', 'Ah', 'Oh, the slippery slope nonsense', 'There is no slope here', 'There are sharp, clear ledges.', 'Frank, you get two questions.', 'Okay', 'If  James he asserts, people are not willing to sign now, because theyre, they dont trust the system and theyre afraid of being declared prematurely dead.  Where does he get his information from?   From idiot surveys.   No good social scientist relies on such evidence.  Youno economist ever wants to make use of a survey.  People say anything in a survey.  Surveys are not a test of anything.  Use a little bit of introspection as to why it is you may or may not sign an organ donor card.   People in general dont want to contemplate their own violent, immediate, surprising death and dismemberment.', 'Great surprise!  Okay.  In my conclusion Ill explain why it is that the market will work, but I', 'Iras not gonna give me any more time', 'Even though I deserve more than anyone else.  [LAUGHTER]', \"Okay, my, mine is a question for Frank.  Now, unlike the other participants in this debate, I'm not a good and generous person. Its true, ask my daughter, shes there.  [POINTS INTO AUDIENCE]  I am so callous and uncaring that I wrote a codicil to my will disinheriting any member of my family who consents to the donation of any of my organs, unless they are paid at least eight hundred and sixty-four dollars and thirty-seven cents per organ.  I posted this on my web page, and other people have downloaded it and amended their wills accordingly.  Now, I ask you, Dr. Pangloss, I'm sorry, I mean Dr. Delmonico [LAUGHTER]  Is your objection to my estate profiting from the salvaging of my organs so strong that you think it just and right to threaten innocent sick people with prison for purchasing my organ?  Is there some great ethical principle that I do not understand under which the sick should be condemned to die rather than obtain organs from the self-interested and even selfish?\", 'I dont think that was an answer, Frank.', 'Well', \"I have to make one, this is directly contrary to what the IOM report of two years ago, of which, weren't you\", 'Institute of Medicine Report, which said no experiments, no trials, nothing in', 'So much pernicious, pretentious foolishness to refute, so little time.  [LAUGHTER]  Are you shocked and surprised that anyone would argue that paying for organs will not increase the supply? I was at first, and then it became clear.  The prospect of an effective organ market places our opponents behind the eight ball.  A market that would recover vital organs now being fed to worms would be the salvation of thousands of patients.  As against the saving of innocent lives, poetic statements about the dignity of human life being degraded by commercialism would be revealed as empty moral pieties.  Our opponents would therefore prefer to believe that a market would not work, and demand that we must prove that it will.  The obvious way to demonstrate the efficacy of a market is to permit one, but of course the law forbids that.  So what other evidence or theory can I offer?  First, consider the thriving organ markets in living donors in places like India.  A market in the US where the interest of donors would be safeguarded by American law would, of course, be much more successful.  And theres no reason to think that somehow the American market would be like the Indian market, in the same way theres no reason to think, if any of you have been to India, that potable water from the tap was as common in India as it is in the United States.', 'And  No!  And what does the success of living donor markets say about a market in cadaver organs?  The sacrifice is incomparably greater for the living donor than for the deceased, so the supply of deceased donors will be far more responsive to a positive price.  Second, look to the very reason that our opponents have such faith in the efficacy of altruism, and at the same time restrict its required application to organs rather than extend it to surgical services, nursing, and hospital care.  They believe that altruism should work for transplant organs, because they are of no value to the dead, and of enormous value to the ill. Whatever this vast disparity should say about the power of altruism, it speaks volumes in the world of markets.  Everywhere we look markets move goods from low valued uses to high valued ones.  Third', 'Ah!  Ive got seventeen more reasons, but youll have to talk to me privately.', 'Thank you.']\n",
      "['Okay.', 'As a surgeon, I view the body with reverence.  The rights and dignity of every patient are paramount.  My expertise is tois sustaining lives by transplanting organs.  It is my inability to do so, because I dont have the organs to offer, that has persuaded me that rewarding the donor is appropriate.  Our opponents tonight would have me tell patients to stay the course.  Wait with dignity for the organ that may never come.   This message is poorly received, as it should be.  Our opponents may tell you, that the waiting list is too long, because it includes the wrong people.  I dont see wrong people, I see human beings, each of whose lives might well be lengthened and improved if I could give them an organ.   Desperate patients unwilling to die waiting have fueled a black market, whose magnitude is inadequately quantified, though certainly disturbing in scope.  What is known, is that organs are purchased, third-party brokers siphon funds away from donors, and safety is uncertain for both the recipient or the donor.   Efforts to shut this market have been as unsuccessful as Prohibition was in inducing an end to the use of alcohol.  I agree with our opponents that the black market must be closed.  I disagree with asking patients to accept death gracefully, instead of resorting to the black market.   My position is that development of a legal, regulated mechanism for donor compensation is the only means of effectively eliminating the demand for this covert activity, closing down the black market, and improving safety for donors and recipients.   Today, we educate the kidney patient and family, hoping that a volunteer donor will step forward to surrender a kidney.  Most transplant surgeons agree, there would be no justification for ever removing a kidney from a living donor, potentially causing harm to this healthy person, if there were sufficient organs from deceased donors.    Why?  It may surprise you, that we still cannot tell this volunteer donor about all of the risks that kidney donation entails.  Sure, the early risks, such as death, are known, but the long-term consequences are not, particularly for some of the more marginal donors being used in some cases.  Nevertheless, we allow and celebrate such a healthy persons choice to donate, and allow him to accept unknown risks for which there is no compensation.   Why are we surprised that more donations dont take place?  Transplanters share nearly universal agreement, that these genuine heroes need lifelong health insurance and intermittent medical supervision.  Dr. Delmonico has written that all living donors should be provided with life and disability insurance.   But in todays reality, we have no mechanism for providing these protections.  Yet we are not deterred from removing the kidney.  The operation itself, and our fees, are covered by the recipients insurance.  The opportunity to save a life persuades us and the donor to proceed.   Compensation for the organ donors time and risks, by providing life insurance, lifelong health insurance, and even a direct monetary fee, is more appropriate than for the donation of an egg, the rental of a uterus for a surrogate pregnancy, or the participation in clinical experimentation, all of which are legal.   We are talking about saving lives.  Lets also recognize that everyone else involved in the transplant prospers.  The recipient gains the organ, life itself. The surgeons, transplant center, and for kidney transplants, even the American taxpayer, you and I, have direct financial benefit when a patient comes off dialysis.   Isnt it disingenuous to exclude the donor from sharing in the tangible benefits resulting from his gift of life?  A reasonable system must include protection from nefarious third parties, and be guaranteed by centralized, independent oversight, that ensures equal accessibility to those in need, regardless of their economic means.   Lastly and most crucially, a transparent, informed consent process must be the mandatory condition of participation.  Our opponents may suggest that payment would be so coerced, as to prevent the donor from giving informed consent.  This is paternalistic.  Why should financial need prevent ones ability to consider the balanced presentations of risk and benefit that donors consider in the currently regulated informed-consent process.  This is an insult to the poor, in suggesting they are incapable of balanced thought and self-determination.  Reasonable people rationalize risk daily, by personal prerogative, at times subjecting themselves to unhealthy conditions, and making unsafe choices such as working deep in the coalmine.   Any informed decision balances risk against the prospect of benefit.  Though real, the risks of organ donation are likely substantially lower than those assumed by coal miners seeking their livelihoods.  Despite the dangers inherent in both cases, the miner but not the donor is legally compensated for these risks.   The key difference is dependence on the participation of medical providers, White House are dedicated to doing no harm, to facilitate payment for the gift of life.  Therefore, according a donor', 'the highest degree of protection throughout necessitates the involvement of the most highly-trained individuals, and the conditions of greatest safety.  This is precisely what does not happen on the black market, where transplants and donations are conducted covertly.   There is no dignity in dying without a transplant.  Dont blame the patient for listening to his internal will to live.  We must offer protection to the donor who answers the recipients call, in a way that is currently legally prohibited. Vote with us to legitimize compensation for the donors acceptance of risk.   Today, the choice is not whether compensation will exchange hands, but whether or not transplant operations and the sale of organs will be regulated and safe.', 'Youre going to ask a physician what role the insurance companies should have', 'No role.  [LAUGHS]  No, its  You know, in general', 'Because in general the insurance companies generally follow Medicare and government guidelines, and as long as thewe set up something that is reasoned, logical and supportable, its hard for them to not follow.', 'Well II shouldnt comment on that.  But I will say that, you know, the concept of how this system would be created requires, um, involvement of multiple parties, in a similar manner to the way UNOS is set up.  That there are not just providers, there are not just patients and family members, there are clergy, there are social workers, and yes, I think it would be reasonable to have some representatives from the major insurance companies for example to be part in the development of these multi-disciplinary panels as they agree on what is the best policy for doing this.  It has to be a uniform policy, and the way the law would need to be written, and we do need a law written, this is obviously currently an illegal activity, so we definitely need legislative change, would be to require that these activities go through the single processor.', 'Okay, before I get to my question I do wanna respond to what James said about the system', 'No, no, no, hehe specifically, responded', 'Mmm, well, I agree with him, that the system should be given every opportunity, we just cant wait for all the people to die, right now, so we all want the system to  work, we all want all of these efforts, we just cant wait.   Now the question.  [LAUGHTER]  And this is for James.  If you object to paying live donors because the poor would allegedly be coerced by poverty into making an unwise choice, do you have any objections to the middle class selling a kidney.   It would not be difficult to restrict organ sales to those whose income is at least 70 percent of the American median.  Sure, that would make kidneys more expensive, we could live with that.  How about you?  Does taking the desperately poor out of the picture make you relent, or do you now move to the paternalistic position that no one should accept any amount of money.', 'So your objection is practical, not ethical or moral?', 'The construct of the system has to be along the lines of what we have with Medicare now and that is that, patients who currently go out of this country to have transplants at non-Medicare- approved transplant centers dont have their medications paid for subsequently.', \"That's prohibited.\", 'What is', 'Frank, were now required to inform every patient', \"Frank, we are now required to inform every patient that if they dont have their transplant performed at a Medicare-approved center, Medicare won't pay for their medications.  Thats the type of system that we ought to proceed with, the same kind of\", \"They shouldn't be permitted to, because they won't have access to medications and other care.\", \"Yeah, thank you for your comments on lag donor safety.  Its critically important.  Nobody has done these long term studies because we dont have a mechanism to capture and retain information about the donors twenty and thirty years out, and we dont have the means of paying for it.  Right now we can have a donor who has no medical insurance whatsoever come and donate a kidney because the recipients insurance pays for it, but we have no mechanism after they get through the early post- operative period to pay for their care.  Thats expensive.  And that's a part of what would need to be in a regulated system.  And thank you very much, all of the advocacy organizations, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, the American Society of Transplantation, the government, and everybody at this table, on both sides, very much agrees that we need to capture the information about donors, we just can't afford to, and in the absence of universal health care or a single system, we can't do it because they just escape, we can't track them.\", \"Our opponents have told you that payment has been tried and is unsafe.  Been there, done that.  We tell you we know the way its being done now is wrong, lets regulate it and do it right.  We have no intention of stopping efforts to increase the number of deceased donor organs.  This does not, in any way, affect those efforts.  We can't afford independently, as transplant centers, or independent societies of transplant surgeons for example, to follow these live donors.  We dont have those funds.  The government could provide the funds to long term provide the safety net and understand whats happening with live donors. What we propose is the only solution to closing the dangerous black market.  Theyve implied the dignity of the donor would be assaulted.  Weve told you theres no dignity for people dying.  We propose an approach that preserves the rights of donors, and compensates them for the risks they do assume.\", \"Well allow them to join us, the club of people who benefit from their life-saving gift.  Isn't that treating them in a most dignified manner?  This is supposedly an academic debate, and David even called it an exercise, but the ninety-nine thousand people currently waiting for organs, who are there for so long that they become inactive because they're too sick to get the transplant then, need real solutions, and they need you and us to be willing to think out of the box.  There are lots of clever people available in this country to devise a system that can do it right, lets do so.\"]\n",
      "['Thank you.  Today there are 75,000 people waiting for kidneys.  I would still be one of them, but thank goodness, a wonderful friend of mine gave me her right kidney two years ago.  But thousands of others are not going to be as lucky as I was.  In New York City in fact, patients suffer on dialysis, can suffer for up to eight years before getting a transplant, and so many of them cant survive that long.  Despite decades and decades of public education about the virtues of organ donation, the waiting list just gets longer, and the time to transplantation just gets longer. So its no surprise that desperate patients take matters into their own hands and try to find their own organs.   They rent billboards begging people to give themto save them.  They join on-line matching services to find a donor, in fact I did that.  Some of them go abroad, and maybe if they go abroad to a place like China, they have to live with the sickening knowledge that the organ they got came from an executed prisoner.   But you cant blame these people.  They are just trying to save their lives.  Now bless all the altruistic souls who have donated organs.  But its past time to face the fact that altruism is just not enough.  Many people need more of an incentive to give.   And thats why we need to be able to compensate people who are willing to give a kidney to a stranger, to save a life.  Heres one proposal.  The government should sponsor a regulated system for living donors. Compensation could be something as simple as a contribution to a retirement fund, a tax credit, tuition voucher for the children, possibly health care, all kinds of creative things we could do to benefit people who are willing to give a kidney.   And as I said, since the government will be paying, not the patient, everyone can benefit.  Now what about the donors.  Would the promise of a reward exploit donors whose poverty makes the offer seem impossible to refuse?  Thats an important consideration.   But a distinction needs to be made.  Its not low-income people who will rush to judgment, and make rash decisions.  Its desperate people.  No one wants someone giving up a kidney because theyre in such financial desperation.  But, this is something we can guard against.   For example we simply dont offer what desperate people want.  Which is immediate cash.  So you can build in several months of a waiting period, you can offer the kind of in-kind compensation I mentioned before.  I mean, I can go on and on about details of how a system could be constructed. But, you get the idea, I mean youve heard the basic idea.  Now, what I want to do, is have you hear some of the misguided objections that our opponents are going to wage.  You may well hear that any effort to legalize rewards for donors, will end up creating a system that will look exactly like the corrupt organ bazaars that permeate the Third World, in this donors are almost considered no more than cattle, and their organs go to the highest bidder.  That is exactly wrong.  We are talking about a transparent, regulated system of exchange, under the rule of law, in which donor protections are paramount.  In fact, what were talking about is the exact opposite of a black market.  The donor is free to decide if participating is in his best interest, and then if it is, something miraculous happens.  He saves someone with his kidney.   You may also hear that the transplant list is really not that bad, its kind of bogus, its inflated.  Really, we dont have to do anything drastic.  Well, we do have to do something drastic, because, of the 75,000 people on the list, it is true, not every one of them is eligible to get a kidney tomorrow.   About a third of them are whats called inactive, meaning that right now they are too sick, if a kidney became available to them tomorrow, they would have to be passed over, because theyre not ready to theyre too fragile for surgery.   But why did that happen?  It happened because they waited years and years and deteriorated so far during that time, that now they couldnt get an organ. Tragically these were people who were healthy when they were first listed.  So if anything, the glut, the one-third of folks who are ineligible to get a kidney today, is a sign for urgency, not complacency.  Youll also hear that the transactions involving organs, any transaction involving organs, is an affront to human dignity.  But no one can ever explain to me how a fair, safe, and respectable implementation of incentives is an affront to anyone. But what is a disgraceful assault on human dignity, is to sit by and let people die when we have the means to save them.   Youll hear that organs and material gain dont mix.  Well, I reject this. Beautiful acts are performed every day by people who are moved by a combination of humanitarian and financial motives.  Are firemen who rush into a burning building any less heroic in our eyes because they were paid to save us?   In the end, our critics have a chilling message for patients.  Shut up, wait on line, and pray that youre not one of the 14 people who will die today because no organ became available for you.  Now dont get me wrong, altruism is a beautiful virtue.  It should and will continue if there is a parallel system', 'of compensating donation.  I know its a beautiful virtue because Im a poster girl for it.  But I also know the deadly consequences of following the same failed policy.  Its something we cant do, and why you must vote for our side.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Okay, so I can address my question', 'Okay.', 'Yes, Dr. Childress, I wanted to ask you  In nineteenIm going to quote you something you wrote in 1992.  [LAUGHTER]  And then we work up.  You said, It would be odd to structure a system designed to promote altruistic behavior, with the result of saving human lifeand youre referring to the UNOS system when a system that relied on financial incentives could save more lives.   So I took this to mean that an altruistic system would be preferable to an incentive system, if it saved more lives, an incentive system would be preferable to an altruistic system if it could be shown to save more lives.   Well, okay, that was 1992. Fast-forward 14 years to 2006 when you were the head of the Institute of Medicine Report on organ donation.  And in answer to the question that the report posed, what should we do about even considering, even pursuing a pilot trial of incentives, you had saidor the report said, but I know you concurredit is not time yet.   Now the report spent a lot of timeIll be quickon cadaver donation.  Ill just say very quicklybelieve it or not, even though two million people die a year, perhaps 20,000 are eligible to become organ donors, its just not that easy to be eligible, as a cadaver, so even if we used every deceased person, there wouldnt be enough.   So your focus on deceased donation would not help.  Im all for it, let a thousand organs bloom, Ive never heard a policy frankly I didnt like, that would increase. But thats not gonna be enough.  So my question to you is', 'if notwell get tohere it is.  If it wasnt time then, in 2006, when is it going to be time.  How many more people are going to have to die until we can have your permission, to finally, at least have a trial of incentives.', 'Its only three minutes.', 'Or thought about it.', 'I did think about it.', \"Frank, I dont understand.  We can do that now.  I can go to Manila now, so I don't see why having a mechanism where organs can be compensated for by a third party makes any difference at all.\", 'Well, the reason I would have to go to Manila', \"is because I couldn't buy it here\", 'Frank!  We can do that now.', 'And people will stay here if they can get it now.', 'Well, first', \"Thank you for bringing up AEI, because its actually a place where we have more intellectual freedom than most universities, which is why I can talk about a regulated system and dont have to adhere to a classic free market form.  Now, the kind of system I have in mind, really is a straw man I think you guys keep setting up, we are not talking about a classic commercial free for all, or a free market, or an eBay system.  Were talking about a third party payer.  For example, today you, Ira, could decide to give a kidney. Youd be called a Good Samaritan donor, you would show up at New York Med, and you would say, please give my organ to the next person on the list in this region, in this hospital, in the country.  And they would do it.  The only difference in a model that were thinking, or I'm thinking about, is where you go and give your organ, and your retirement account is wired forty thousand dollars, end of story.  Everything else is the same, the, the screening you go through, the same medical check up, everything.\", 'Can I take his minute?', 'Can he yield his time to', 'Okay.', \"Thanks.  Well, during the time weve been here tonight, yes, someone has died, and this was a real person with a real family who would have lived if there were enough organs.  It may sound maudlin, but its very true.  And this is why we need to compensate donors.  Altruism, or whatever is in that area between being paid and giving an organ is not enough.  And insisting that it remain the basis for transplant policy is a reckless and derelict stance that will only guarantee a future of suffering, and not just for the patients, but for, who will languish and die on dialysis, but for black market donors as well.  Our opponents hate the black market, well so do we.  But somehow we learned something they never did, that the only way to stop elicit transactions is to sanction legal ones.  Simply clamping down on elicit sales only drives it further underground, or causes it to blossom somewhere else, and the only way out of this tragic bind is to increase the supply.  And the only way to do that is through a fair, transparent, safe, and legal means of exchange. Until then, the fate of third world donors and the patients who need their organs to live will remain tragically entwined.  And until then, our opponents, who refuse to allow even experimentation with compensation, will be complicit, yes complicit, in fostering the organ trade.  We welcome the other side to work with us, but as youve seen, theyve never met a proposal they didn't reject or attack, they have a dearth of creative ideas, but an abundance of passion for obstructing innovation.  In closing, unless we establish a legal market for kidneys in some form, we should brace ourselves for more needless suffering and death.  Our side refuses to stand for that. So should you.  Its too high a price for a humane society to bear. Thank you.\", 'I could have gone.', 'Thank you, thank you.']\n",

      "['Its important before you cast your vote in this debate to think carefully about the resolution, and to think carefully about the way that we defined it.  As we said in our very first speech, we support the proposition that Islam is dominated by radicals, and we define radicalism in relation to human equality.  In the Muslim world, is there belief in equality between religions?  Is there belief in equality between genders?  Is there support for basic freedoms, like freedom of speech, and freedom of religion? The other side has not addressed these issues.   Instead theyve changed the subject, speech after speech, and defined this resolution only with respect to violence.  Theres a reason that in neither of our previous two speeches, did we talk about violence, Ill talk about it a little bit here because theyre bringing it up. But they havent refuted any of our basic arguments about how human equality is not being met in the Muslim world.  Weve talked about it in two different ways, weve talked about equality in terms of freedom of religion, and weve talked about equality of gender and theyve said not one word on it.   Their last speech, I have to say, is a little late to do so.  The reason this is important, is because we need to understand the severity of the problem. The reason we need to  understand this, is because, if, in fact, the Muslim world is dominated by moderates and neo-progressives who are going to usher in a new era of prosperity and freedom, then theres not much that we in the West need to do about it. But if on the other hand, radicals are ascendant, then we need to play a bigger role, and we need to put greater emphasis on this corner of the world.  So the way we think about it fundamentally matters, and it matters to those who are suffering under totalitarian systems.   Now, look at the key areas of the debate. Look at freedom of religion.  This is something that affects people. In 14 Muslim countries, right now, it is illegal to change your religion, in eight of these countries, it is punishable by death. That is, you cannot convert out of Islam in these countries.   That does not support equality between religions.  This is supported also, by anti-proselytism laws, laws that prevent people from other faiths from propagating their own faiths, while at the same time Saudi money goes out throughout the entire globe, propagating a Wahabist version of Islam.  This also is supported by anti-blasphemy laws.  Laws that are used to suppress people who have a view of religion that does not conform with the very stringent view that a state might have.  Now they have a couple of arguments here.  One argument they made is polls.   Now unfortunately, their argument about the polls which is trying to give you a broader view, only deals with violence.  Well lets talk about polling a little bit.  One recent poll,  by Policy Exchange that was undertaken in Britain back in 2006 shows that a shocking 36 percent of British Muslims between the ages of 16 and 24, said that someone who converts from Islam to another faith, should be punished by death.   Thats within the West, you get a 36 percent support for this.  Now, 36 percent obviously is not a majority.  But what it shows, is the hegemony, as we framed it, of radicals, the fact that these ideas are seeping into the West, where people are familiar with Western customs, Western freedoms, and have had a chance to live in them.  Now, the oddbut, and another thing about the polls incidentally, is theyre not necessarily as benign as the other side makes them out to be.  For example, a recent poll conducted by Pew found that 15 percent of Indonesians supportbelieve that violence in defense of Islam is justified.  Well 15 percent isnt a whole lot. But when you look at Indonesia which is the worlds most populous Muslim country, youre talking about 25 million people. I find that number to be a bit disturbing.  And its out of line with what youd find comparably Christians saying, in terms of whether defense of their faith is justified, whether violence is justified, in terms of defense of Christianity.   Now, that is relevant to assessing whether this resolution is correct.  Now, moving on to other arguments that they made, Edina says, dont look at pockets, people define the faith.   Well thats non- responsive, because from the very first speech onward, we have said, that the majority of Muslims do not support radicalism. Rather, its that radicals enjoy hegemony, via institutions, via the propagation of the faith.   And Edina actually gives up the game in her speech, because she concedes that Saudi Arabia is radical. Remember, folks, were not talking about Al Qaeda here.  The question is not whether Muslims support Al Qaeda, its not whether Al Qaeda has hegemony, its radicals.   And Saudi Arabia today, is the biggest country in terms of propagating a view of Islam.  And one reason that Reza, uh, feared that I might talk about my view from the trenches, is that in a previous incarnation before I was in counterterrorism, I was working for a Saudi Arabian charity and actually got somewhat radicalized by them, its inin a book that you can read somewhere or other. But the point is that, Ive seen Saudi propaganda from the inside. And Saudi propaganda does take root.  If you look at countries and this is something that Paul talked about in the very first speech.  If you look at countries from Bosnia to Indonesia to Somalia, countries that for a long time had a very moderate practice of Islam.   As Saudi money has gone in there, and as youve had these institutions, these mosques, these charitable organizations, the practice of Islam has fundamentally shifted. Things are not gonna get better on their own.  Because, look at the price of oil.   Saudi Arabia is the worlds biggest exporter of oil, in addition to the being the worlds biggest exporter of radical ideology.  And the price of oil is skyrocketing.  Over $100 a barrel, you have Hugo Chavez and others talking about how it should be $200 a barrel.  Thats not unrealistic.   And with this power, with this oil money, youll see these radical ideas continue to take shape.  Saudi Arabia is a powerful country.  In conceding that Saudi Arabia is radical, they fundamentally concede that this debate is not about Al Qaeda.  Its about the radical institutions. And those radical institutions are indeed taking foot.   She says look at the Muslim scholars.  She says that they affirm freedom of expression, and condemned the riots over the Danish cartoons. But look at what the Organization of the Islamic Conference did, the OIC.  In response to the Danish cartoons, they', 'pushed for a ban in the UN.  They said that there should be a new law to prevent cartoons like that coming up ever again. These are cartoons that were published in the West.   And the Islamic countries believe that its their right to make sure that the West alters its precept of free speech, to conform with norms that would be more suitable.  That is why were saying, that radicals have hegemonic power, and thats why you should vote for this resolution. [APPLAUSE]', 'And you believe that from a group whose message was the Koran is our Constitution', 'I mean, the Muslim Brotherhood is very clear on what their goals are.  Hassan al-Banna, talked about this, [UNCLEAR]', 'Islamic state, and', 'their motto remains, the Koran is our Constitution', 'Okay, Mohammed [UNCLEAR]', 'Okay  [LAUGHTER]', 'Well, you have to parse some of those laws, I mean theres the racial incitement laws which is one thing, and I dont have a problem with racial incitement laws.  Then theres vilification laws.  Vilification laws are adopted in some countries, France and Italy are examples.   Most countries in Europe do not have it, including Britain.  I do thinkin terms of those, its debatable as to why a country would have it, whether its evidence of radicalism.  But I think saying that every country in the world should adopt a certain law to limit speech in the case of religion, is evidence of radicalism', 'Notnot per se a mark of extremism, I agree with that but I think that contextually I would define it as such, it looks like Paul has something he wants to', 'Well', 'that would be a very relevant and interesting question if this were a different resolution.  In the end the resolution isnt whether the US is dominated by radicals or not.  Now', 'I mean, looking at the specifics of it, it was 46 percent of 23 percent, I think, I dont know, that seems to be about, 11 and a half percent, my math could be a little bit off, you kind of went on for a little while there.  But what I will say is evidence of hegemony, is when', '46 percent', 'of 300 million think thatwell, Id have to see the study, and one thing that I can say is that I think that in the evangelical community, which Im a part of, theres a lot of push-back against  I mean you were, youre going on and on about the AKP, and I actually agree with you on the AKP, I dont think they should be banned.   But theres a theres disagreement here but, I dont think they should be banned', 'Okay', 'The AKP is just', 'But, with respect to the United States, within the evangelical community theres a lot of push-back against religion simply being pushed out of the sphere, the public sphere, 100 percent, thats the way the First Amendment has been interpreted for some time.   And I would say that some of the disturbing poll results are not evidence of radicalism but instead, this push- back', 'Actually it was, Reza, but I appreciate your [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'Um', 'Well actually I answered it', '[UNCLEAR] which is that the question is not relevant.  And I dont know what way theyd wanna do it, I havent seen the poll results, I cant judge.', 'All right, Im going to ask it to Reza since we seem to be the two boxers of the bunch.  And it willmy question will not go on and on and on, rather, its', 'somewhat to the point', 'Touch', 'So, Im interested actually in your answer.  You talked about the polls on violence during your first speech.  My question is, first of all do you still find the raw numbers disturbing, I talked a bit about the Pew study on Indonesia, 15 percent equates to 25 million people who support violence in the name of the religion. And then second, do you find it disturbing, regardless of whether they name religion as one of their motivating factors for it, which was one of the points that you made as well.', 'But, pugilistically,  when Andres Serranos', 'Piss Christ came out, Christians werent rioting on the streets. Whereas with the Danish cartoons you had over 100 people killed throughout the world.', 'As opposed to there being cartoons ridiculing your religion? [LAUGHTER]', 'As aoh, as a matter of fact, so you do think that its okay to riot in response to, you think that thats okay', 'And to kill people?', 'Over 100 people died.', 'Clearly, to commit acts of violence, its not act in defense of religion', 'Its commit acts of violence, thats what the survey said', 'And this goes to show why Islam is dominated by radicals', 'No, no.', 'Sorry, dude, I got the last applause line.  [LAUGHTER]', 'So the people', 'who died should yield to the fact that', 'theyre unsophisticated', 'in their knowledge that they died.', 'Its also very real in Indonesia', 'four islands to be directed [UNCLEAR] [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'Thats not what were talking about', 'Well, itwell, okay, the way you frame it it is, but thats not what I said.  What I said, going off Edinas remarks that Saudi Arabia is radical, is I talked about how the facthow I used to work for a Saudi charity that did propagate radical material.  So Ive seen this firsthand, and can say that Saudi charity, Saudi institutions, Saudi imams, make a difference throughout the world.   And the reason why theyre so widespread, is indeed because Saudi Arabia has a lot of money to spend, due to its oil revenues.  The point I was making was simply that oil revenues arent going to dry up any time soon.   Rather, the price of oil is skyrocketing.  And as a result, these institutions are out there, far more than they were before.  That goes to the point of hegemony.  That goes to who has the power', 'who has the money, whos installing the imams.  And indeed', '[UNCLEAR]', '[UNCLEAR]', 'Okay, but we actually talked about that, Paul talked about that in the very first speech.  Where he talked about the changes in Islam, in places like Indonesia, in the Balkans, in Somalia, look at Somalia.  Where you have a war wracking the country, where the group formerly known as the Islamic Courts Union, now known as the Alliance for Reliberation of Somalia, managed to conquer the country, impose Islamic law in which people were arrested for watching Pretty in Pink, in which a karate instructor who had female students was arrested, where people were arrested for watching the World Cup.   That stuff was unheard of in Somalia 30 years ago.  And nowand today, that is the reality on the ground.  So I can say for a fact, that yes, this oil money and this dawa, is making a difference, and its making a difference in the way that affects peoples lives.', 'In', 'Okay, sure.  I think that the changes in Iraq have had both effects.  On the one hand, I think the Iraq war has clearly been a rallying point for radicals, and whether thats justifiable or unjustifiable is something that people can decide on their own. But clearly, its been a great recruiting ground for Al Qaeda and others.  The flip-side of that is that, we had some discussion before of the anti-jihadist movements that are there, things like the Sakwa [PH] movement.  And those have had a cognizably good impact.  I think on the whole, uh, the fighting there is something that is energizing of radicals in the Muslim world without a question.  And thats not going to stop regardless of the Sakwa [PH] movement.', 'In this debate weve defined hegemony in two ways.  We have defined it as being hegemony over institutions, and hegemony over states.  Now, Richard Bulliett in his last speech finds a contradiction, in that he says that the autocratic governments arent actually Islamic.  Now, heres a statistic that Asra put forward previously in the Q&A, which is important.  About one billion of the worlds Muslims live in Muslim-majority countries. There are 22 countries, in which Islam is declared the state religion.   A look at the numbers shows that about 602 million Muslimsthats 58 percent of those living in predominantly Muslim countrieslive in places where Islam is the state religion. So, the autocracies are indeed enforcing Islam.  Thats one thing that theyre doing.   But its not just the autocracies.  Its the institutions.  The institutions are important as well.  And their argument, as Bulliett expressed in his last opening speech, is that for all the reasons given to you by the other side, vote against the motion, it comes down to a question of what hegemony means. And the only person on this side who tried to defendto define hegemony, is Richard Bulliett.', 'Who said hegemony requires a majority.  Well, by that logic, everyone on that side has talked about how the US is a hegemon. Does that mean that the majority of people in the world are then Americans?  Of course not.   The fact is here, that if you look at where power is, power is in the hands of those who are trying to enforce a particularistic view of Islam.  Look at the institutions, look at the anti-apostasy laws.  Look at anti-blasphemy laws. Look at the prohibition on evangelism.   Look at prohibitions on free speech.  This is not a pretty situation.  And its important to recognize where the power lies.  Thats what were asking you to do.  Were asking you to vote for the resolution, to identify the challenges that all of us, all debaters acknowledge, lay ahead. And thats why I would like you to vote for this resolution.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Good.  Okay, thank you very much for inviting us all this evening and thank you for being here.  We in favor of this motion argue that Islam is dominated by radicals.  What do we mean by radicals?  We mean those who are striving for a political order representing a reactionary version of Islam that denies legal and civic equality to men and women and also denies it on the basis of religion. It also denies freedom of speech and freedom of thought.  We believe such trends, such people, currently dominate world Islam.  Let us be quite clear about what we are not arguing. We are not arguing that Islam itself is inherently radical.  Like any other movement, Islam takes different forms at different times.  Also, we are not arguing that most Muslims are radical.  Most are not. But what we are saying is that it is the radicals who have their hands on the levers of power.  They are, to pick a word, the hegemonic.  Theyre the most powerful driving force.  Theyre tending to set the direction and shaping the future of Islam in the modern world.  They do this not because they have superior numbers, but because they are extremely focused in what they want.  Theyre clear about it.  They are often well organized. Theyre often very well funded, often by Saudi Arabia and they are very, very committed, being quite willing to often kill themselves and to kill other people, especially Muslims.  So this is what were arguing.  To illustrate this I just want to show some of the trends which we have seen in the world in the last twenty-five to thirty years.  Some twenty-nine years ago, of the major Muslim countries in the world only one -- Saudi Arabia - maintained that its political and constitutional order was a reflection of what it regards as original Islam and that it has accepted no foreign or infidel accretions. Saudi Arabia was, and is, one of the worlds most repressive states.  Many, many examples could be given but I just mention one recent incident when three Saudi intellectuals sent a petition to the king   a petition asking for a gradual move towards a constitutional government.  They were charged with using  I quote  un-Islamic terminology.  The un-Islamic terminology they used in their petition included the word human rights and democracy.  So we have the situation of Saudi some thirty years ago.  Then in February of 1979, the Ayatollah Komeini overthrows the Shah and establishes a draconian regime in Iran, which also since then has become one of the most repressive regimes in the world. It bars anybody who is not a Muslim from having any authority over a Muslim.  It bars Muslims who do not support the regimes version of Islam from running for political office.  One other example:  In Iran, if you kill someone who is a member of one of the non-listed religions, non-recognized religions  say, such as the Bahais  there is no punishment.  To kill a dog, a cat or a Bahai is the same thing.  It is no matter of the law because they have no legal status.  They do not religiously and politically exist. Similarly, for sexual relations between a non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman, the penalty for the non-Muslim is death.  And of course, the penalty for homosexuals of whatever religion is death. A new proposed penal code has been presented to the Iranian Parliament which would institutionalize its current practice that it would require with no possibility of reprieve, annulment that the penalty for heresy or for apostasy -- leaving Islam-- is death. Article 112 of this, this penal code also emphasizes the law will be extraterritorial.  This means, incidentally, if this law is in fact passed, under Iranian law Barack Obama should be executed as an apostate.  With the development of Iran next door to them, the Saudis redoubled their own efforts to export their own version of radical Islam.  They proclaim themselves, on many occasions, the Muslim Vatican --  a very un-Muslim term -- and now, by most best estimates, spend some three billion dollars exporting their radical version of Islam around the world.  Thats somewhat more, thats about three times as much as the Soviet Union used for ideological purposes at the height of its power.  If one travels to a moderate Muslim country, such as Indonesia, or if you travel throughout Africa, you will find Saudi-funded mosques, Imams, lectures, sermons, students, books, videos, fatwas propagating its own reactionary version of Islam.  The Iranians seek to do the same.  One result of this, though there are homegrown radical movements, with this organizational push behind them, one sees the growth of radical Islam throughout the world.  Some examples:  when Pakistan was founded it was not founded ', 'as an Islamic country.  The Ali Jinnah  the man who founded the country --  said, whether youre a Muslim or youre a non- Muslim is no matter of the state.  But now they have introduced blasphemy laws, which include the death penalty, particularly used on religious minorities.  In Sudan, the government has instituted laws and propagated genocidal wars against the south in Darfur, killing some two million and two hundred and fifty thousand, respectively.  In Nigeria, some fifty thousand people have died in conflict over the introduction of radical Islam.  We see this phenomena repeated throughout the world and one could give very many more examples.  One sees it even in, growing in Malaysia and Indonesia  historically very moderate countries. One result is that in Freedom Houses rankings of the worlds twenty un-free countries, the majority now are Muslim.', '[OVERLAP]  Okay, the crucial confluence of ideas is not between the West and the Muslim world ', 'it is within the Muslim world.  Thank you.', 'Because most Muslims dont like the radicals agenda.  But', 'Well, no, I think if people have guns, if they have intimif they intimidate people, if theyre organized, if they have funding, if one sees even in Indonesia the increase in radical movements, radical Islam radical imams, who were not there 10, 20, 15 years ago. When you see in Indonesia the destruction of hundreds of churches, where 10 years in Indonesia, 20 years ago you wouldnt would never have seen that, people coexisted.  So even in places like Indonesia, in places like Bangladesh, in places like Malaysia, even though most of the people dont want it, you have the growth of radical movements, and they often win, because they intimidate and scare other people', 'By the way, most of the churches are non-ethnic Chinese.', 'And you', '[UNCLEAR] that Laskar jihad does not justify its attacks that way, it, its', 'its just not a general religious war against Christians', 'Its just the primary group responsible for, for that violence', 'I agree with you and Edina that they dont dominate the discussions, the conferences, when people', 'get together', 'but those dont have much effect.', 'The people  [OVERLAPPING VOICES]  the people with professors, every time.', 'Good debate though.', 'Yeah, depends what the government is, you have through the Organization of Islamic Confernce an effort going on, since about 1999, to repress through the international system, to repress speech it says is critical of Islam, or blasphemous.  Pakistan has been big on this, Iran has been big on this, the Saudis have been big on this.   Remember, example, brief example I gave before is Saudi democracy activists are accused of blasphemy.  In Iran, Akbar Gangi, the major dissident, was accused of insulting Islam. Domestically these repressive regimes use charges of blasphemy to squelch the opposition, basically they say, we represent Islam, you criticize us, you criticize Islam, youre a blasphemer.  When these regimes try to pushy this into the international sphere I think it should be strongly opposed.', 'I dont like that either', 'Well, Ill quote the current guardian if you want.', 'Yes, Professor Bulliet.  In arguing, you opposed our use of the word hegemony, and said when, say, 30 percent or so of British Muslim youth want to kill someone who rejects Islam, or believes they should be killed, you said thats not a majority, hegemony equals majority.   But, would you not agree that in the regimes were talking about, if one is talking about Egypt, or Saudi Arabia, or a vast number of other countries, the majority of the people may oppose something.   But surely you would agree that currently the Saudi Arabian government is hegemonic, the Iranian government is hegemonic in terms of what shapes that country.', 'No, just stop there', 'No, no, no, I just like Turkey.', 'Okay.  Just one quick comment, Edina, you are being very unfair. As you know, I was on my honeymoon last week, and did not pay too much atten', 'the only person who didnt pay too much attention to what General Petraeus said.  [LAUGHTER]  But the I would be, I wouldnt have enough knowledge of on the ground in Iraq to dispute that.   But it may well be the case that sort of more radical forces, not just the Al Qaeda types, but the Mahdi army and these other groups, that the Iraqis are sort of getting fed up with them and resisting them.  This may well be the case.  And, obviously, I would regard that, I think most of us would regard that as a good thing.  But it would not, for me, make a difference in terms of my overall view of dominant trends in the Muslim world, in Africa, Asiasouth Asia, southeast Asia and so forth.', 'Okay, yes, we do argue it is a question of institutions, who is controlling organizations.  Course one of those major and the most powerful of those organizations, is states.  Though not just them.  Weve spoken not just about Saudi Arabia, weve spoken about Iran.  Compared to the situation of 30 years ago, whereas a with a radical Islamic regime you basically, just had the Saudis, at least a large one.   Then you had Iran.  Then youve had Sudan.  Then youve had radicalization in Pakistan which has continued.  Youve had events in Somalia.  Youve had events in Nigeria.  If you look at places where more radical movements are not per se the government, but are increasing influencing it, and are more powerful and have established themselves as the opposition, we see this in Egypt.   We see this in Algeria.  We see this in Malaysia.  We see this in Indonesia.  And in each of those countries we see an increase', 'of violence.  So in each of these settings, compare the situation 20 years ago, and the situation now.  If you look at movements amongst Muslims, say amongst the Palestinians, amongst the Chechnyans, around Kashmir, in the Philippines, in Thailand, in Lebanon   Youve had movements that are opposing the government.  Usually it was in terms of national liberation or political freedom or access to resources.  Now in each of those a shift towards a more radical Islamic emphasis.  We see this across the board, in setting after setting.   It is now more radical than it was then.  Of course theres a push-back, from Jordan. Ive been involved in some of these conferences.  Similarly with Turkey, similarly with Morocco, with Indonesian organizations. But they cannot maskso far, I hope they willbut so far they cannot mask the power, the resources, which are arrayed against them.  Currently, in the war of ideas', 'within the Muslim world, the radicals are winning.']\n",
      "['So I would say assalamu alaykum to all of you, but according to the prayer book that I was handed when I went on the pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, Im not allowed to say this peaceful greeting to those who arent Muslim.  When I see that headline:  Islam is dominated by radicals, I dont hesitate in believing it to be true. The opposite side wants to suggest that we cant tell you stories from the trenches.  But it is, in fact, in the trenches where we know what is happening, that we know that the radicals are, in fact, intimidating, silencing and paralyzing the moderates.  I know it from my lifetime in the Muslim community and I know it from stories and anecdotes, sure, and historical and country cases.  When I was given this proposition I asked my mother  a grandmother, who has taught me my Muslim prayers, who is teaching her grandchildren the prayers  I said, Do you think that Islam is dominated by radicals?  You can dismiss her as an anecdote.  You can dismiss her as somebody who isnt pundit enough but shes got her finger on the pulse of whats going on in our communities.  And she didnt hesitate in saying yes.  For the last thirty years that I have known, since the exportation of Wahabiism from Saudi Arabia to the far reaches of our Muslim world, I know that our community is dominated by radical ideology. I know that it is an ideology that has taken root in countries from Pakistan to states in Nigeria to provinces in Indonesia with laws that put women in second class status, that give women criminal punishments because of sexual crimes.  In each instance you could say that theres a political purpose.  But at the end of the day it is done in the name of Islam.  I dont stand up here and condemn my faith.  I fight for it every single day.  I fight for a progressive interpretation of our faith.  But at the end of the day our religion, our institutional Islam out there in the world -- from my home town of Morgantown, West Virginia to Islamabad, Pakistan to Indonesia to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  we are controlled and dominated by radical ideology.  The moderates dont want to lose their status.  They dont want to lose their place in the community.  They dont want to lose their invitation to the potluck dinner parties and wedding halls that they get to go to. Its an issue of social dynamics.  At the end of the day it isnt worth it to them to take on the radical ideology because theres too much at stake.  You risk your own safety and then you risk your social standing.  I know this as a woman in the faith.  I know that what we are struggling with is a situation where more mosques in America than in the 1990s are putting women in separate sections.  Two-thirds of mosques in America versus half in the 1990s have women separated.  And you could argue that thats not radical ideology.  But at the end of the day it is part of a continuum of an interpretation of Islam that takes a literal read that says a woman is sexual temptation, that a woman is sexual distraction. You take that interpretation and it isnt that long that you have to also add up to an interpretation that says that you cant be friends with the Jews and the Christians, that violence is acceptable. Why do I know this?  Because Ive heard it from my pulpit.  Ive heard it from the sermons that are downloaded on college campuses across this country and across the world.  There is an exportation of this ideology.  We may watch our borders, we may check the visas of people who come into this country but I know that there is an ideology that says that a woman is half the witness of a man in criminal cases, that that is law in countries of our, of our religion, that there is interpretation that says that a woman gets less inheritance.  When we put women -- half of our population, in particular -- in second class status around the world, you can call it anything you want.  But I consider it unacceptable and I call it radical ideology.  Its unacceptable to have tradition become religion with female genital mutilation.  Its unacceptable to have honor killings, as we are, from Canada to Texas to Turkey.  You can call those anecdotes but its a trend. Its a trend thats happening because our Islam of today is dominated by radicals.  We dont have mosque leaders who are keeping that kind of ideology in check.  We are, in fact, having leaders who accept preaching from the pulpit that says that we cannot imitate the dis-believers, that we cannot say assalamu alaykum to those who are not Muslim.  At the end of the day what I want you to know is that I stand up for Islam as a faith.  I stand up for the principles just like every other religion.  But like Judaism and Christianity have evolved so that there is a continuum in institutional religion, so that there is a reform synagogue along with the orthodox synagogue, our mosques are defined by an institutional puritanical interpretation that to me is very radical and very unacceptable.  And I encourage you to vote to support this motion because we need a truth telling.  We need to be honest.', 'We need to not cower in the face of political correctness.  A lot of you may have hesitation because you think that if you vote for the motion you are voting and condemning Islam.  I dont stand here before you saying that that is at all on the table.  We can stand up for religion that is not dominated by radicals, but we can accept the fact when it is.  And in our day, in the trenches in the Muslim world from a mosque just a few blocks away from here to Seattle, Washington to Dubai, we are facing a momentum where the leadership is one that accepts radical ideology and the moderates dont stand up against it.  So I encourage you to vote for the motion and understand that its a vote for truth.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]', 'They dominate actions.  What I thought was really', 'interestingwhat I thought was really interesting was that, Edina, you even talked about the moderates reemerging as the dominant force in the faith, an acknowledgement that they are not the dominant faith [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'I would like to just make the point that, talk is great to point out, this is not a popularity contest of what Muslims mostly think.  I mean this is about our institutional faith, if you ask me.  When we talk about whether Islam is dominated by radicals, domination to me is, do they have leadership in our communities, and are they taking action that is representative of a violent strain of Islam and Id say yes.', 'But what does', 'They were Muslim political activists?', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Hmm.', 'Well, Edina said earlier that to suggest that radicals dominate--as is our proposition there--Islam is like saying that murderers define America.  So, 22 countries are the number of countries that declare that Islam is the state religion.  Of those, 14 say that conversion of Islam is illegal.  The good professor suggested that in fact we are correct that, Islamic law in Saudi Arabia and all of these other countries suggest inequity.  So my question to you, thank you', 'isthe laws are defined by ideology that represents inequity. Most of the countries are governed by Islamic states, in the name of Islam.  How do you then argue that, therethe excuse is autocracies, that the equivalent is as if murderers were running America.', 'Well, they have Islam as their state religion', 'under Islamic law.', 'Because this is not a homecoming queen contest.', 'And there has to be a fight because  [APPLAUSE] There has to be a fight, I want to just make the point again', 'there has to be a fight because the leadership is dominated by radicalism.', 'In yes, patriarchy is a form of radicalism if you ask me', 'Sure, but', 'Right, but unfortunately, our society, our Muslim society is defined right now by a patriarchy that, the Christian and Jewish societies have evolved beyond.', 'Oh, Im sorry.  [LAUGHTER]  Im sorry, I didnt just get censored in Dubai because I wanted to talk about womens rights.  Oh, Im sorry, the mosque up the street didnt tell me that I couldnt pray in the main hall, because thats not what a womans supposed to do.  Oh, Im sorry, those men that surrounded me', 'Excuse me', 'orthodox synagogues are a portion', 'Excuse me', 'Theyre a portion of', 'Theyre a portion of the Jewish community but the end of the day', 'orthodox', 'orthodox ideology is what defines our communities.

That is a statistic', 'that is', 'Thats the Council', 'Council on American-Islamic Relations who are, consider themselves the NAACP of the Muslim world fighting for womens rights.   I mean this is the reality.  We can talk politics, we can talk all sorts of, you know, dictatorships, ultimately, were dealing with bullies in the community who want to push their radical ideology [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'And have we not gotten at least some movement where we have churches now, where we have women as priests.  Where we have Catholic women who are', 'fighting for the right to', 'Oh, really.', 'Id love to go to them, in China, in some rural areas, oh, Ill take a trip there but, I dont think', 'Oh, really, Reza, tell me where I could go', 'Right', 'Right', 'Right', 'Women imams to teach', 'the women.  You know, because theyre acceptable for the sisters, but at the end of the day, theyre not good enough for the men', 'And that to me is unacceptable.', 'Because', 'Like I said before, I mean this is not a conversation about the majority of Muslims.  Were talking about whether Islam is dominated.  Dominated to me means institutional Islam, it means the people who are running our mosques, the people who are running ourour organizations.   It means, this establishment that it call Wahabism Incorporated, that is basically not just, you know, a pocket, an emptyan empty anecdote.  It is an empire out there in the world that is defining our community.  This isnt a popularity contest about whether we want moderate expression of Islam or not.   This is about whos running our communities. And I can tell you that institutional Islam is representing a radical ideology that may not represent what most of Muslims believe, but at the end of the day, its not worth the trouble for most Muslims to battle them.   I can tell you from the trenches, the struggle to battle that kind of institutional Islam is painful. You lose status, you get death threats, you get all sorts of abuse. And this is what happens whenever you challenge the authorities, and right now the authorities represent radical Islam.', 'Regain the ground, wrestled back our communities, I dont think so.  A Christian or Jew cannot go into Mecca, because youre banned.  A woman cannot travel into Mecca, because of the laws of the land that say that she has to have a chaperone. The men in our community have decided that in fact their radical version of the ideology allows them to, to retain power.  You can call it an autocracy, you can call it dictatorships, you can call it anything you want, but it is radical and it is dominating our communities.   Just look at the example of the South, in the 1930s lets say.  Civil rights  Lets exchange the words of our proposition.  The South was dominated by white supremists at that time.  Would they have been the majority?  Maybe not.  But they controlled the churches, they controlled the cops, they controlled the laws, they controlled the power structure.', 'Thats what were talking about.  Our laws, our power structure, our cops, our clerics, are all on the payroll of an ideology that is radical.  And its an issue of great pain to me as a Muslim, its an issue of great sadness.  It breaks my heart that this is the reality and the truth, and its an ugly truth.   But, I challenge you, to accept it, because even though its ugly, its only when were honest about it that were actually gonna be able to change the world so that this reality, where Muslims regain the ground and take back our communities, will actually happen one day.  It hasnt happened yet.  And, I can only hope that it will happen. But right now, we are not, we have not won the war, and the struggle continues, and I assure you that we are in the struggle.', 'Thank you.']\n",

      "['I think one of the points you were trying to make is that it will staunch the willingness of our allies to join with us in these coalitions.  I think John, you said coalition is the way were gonna go in the future.  I agree with that, but I dont think that this aspect is going to pay that big of a role because when you look at the interrogation techniques that our allies use, theyre much tougher than we are.   Look at the way the French interrogate, look at the way the British interrogate, I that they go far beyond our Army Field Manual.', 'Let, let me', 'You', 'Welland I think we need to but this Abu Ghraib thing to rest, and youre absolutely right, this was not the interrogations were talking about.  This was a bunch of military policemen running amok, it was a breakdown ofwhere were their officers, where were the NCOs, it was a complete breakdown of the chain of command', 'It was set up by the, by the command in Baghdad and there have been careers ruined for this, General Sanchez is out of the army now.  And heshe set up an unworkable chain of command, he put the intelligence people in charge of the prison.  You dont do that', 'Well, well just follow up on some of this, I had several pages of notes here, but Heather and David went through them quite quickly, so  [LAUGHS]  Ill speak to some of the subjects that weve brought up hereall this is great theory.  I appreciate what all of the other speakers have brought to this, and most of the time were talking theory.   Id like to inject some reality into this. Im going to submit that Im probably the only one on the stage thats been waterboarded.  I dont consider it torture, but by no means do I consider it pleasant and its not something you sign up to do, you know, for your summer camp.   The Air Force did it during our training to show us what it was like, the purpose of it was to show us the treatment that we could expect as potential prisoners of war.  And the point was made and I want to underscore this, never in our history have we gone into a conflict and our prisoners been treated right, the Geneva Convention was an attempt to make that happen.   I submit that it has failed miserably.  It restricts what we can do, we make sure we treat people right, and we get no reciprocal treatment at all.  So it does not worknow.  John McCain will tell you that torture doesnt work, and that hes against it because of his experiences in North Vietnam.  No one can take away the fact that he was brutally treated, brutally tortured, and he has the gravitas to address this issue.   But you have to understand that John McCain was the victim of torture for the infliction of pain.  The Vietnamese were great at that.  They could hurt you, they could make you say things that maybe you didnt want to say.   For the most part, our prisoners did very well.  They gave up what they thought their interrogators wanted to hear which is the biggest threat you have when you resort to torture.  Whoever youre torturing, the subject, is going to tell you what he thinks you want to hear. Just like a defector, weve seen how bad information leads to bad actions, remember Curveball.  The bad information about the Iraqi mobile labs.  This is another instance where people tell you things they [sic]  want to hear.   Someone being tortured will tell you anything, anything, to stop the pain, to stop the treatment. Waterboarding, someone mentioned a figure 60 to 90 seconds.  I can tell you that after about 35 seconds I was ready to tell them anything they wanted to hear.   And I knew this was an exercise. You know, and in the back of your mind, your instructors are telling you, project yourself into a situation.  Imagine this to be real.  I survived by telling myself, I know this is a game.  That theyre going to let me up before I drown.  So, there is that reflex, and waterboarding is so powerful, that it will make you say something.  So, in the hands of skilled interrogators, can waterboarding work?  Absolutely, but you have to know what youre doing.   The North Vietnamese did not know what they were doing.  They were great at inflicting pain, lousy at extracting effective, useful  intelligence.  Now does it work?  Well, you hate to say trust the government.  But we have two government officials that say it worked.   That would be the former director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, and the director of the bin Laden Unit, Alex Station.  Dr. Mark Shore, youve seen him on television, hes making the rounds, I think he has a book out.  It can be effective if its done properly.  The question is, not, can we do it, the question is, should we do it?  And thats where we have to decide, or is the tough interrogation of these suspects necessarydo we want to go beyond whatever line that is.  I can tell you the line that the government is trying to draw, is the Army Field Manual, I worked under the Army Field Manual, its pretty restrictive, the new one is even more restrictive, they rewrote it in November of 2006.   Its online, type in to Google, Army Field Manual Interrogation, its a voluminous document, its written in typical Army bureaucratese, theres probably four pages in it worth reading.  So, and those are the ones that tell you the 16 psychological approaches you can use, none of which will be effective against a terrorism suspect because those techniques were written, just as someone said, to break a captured enemy soldier.   One probably with no resistance training whatsoever.  When we started taking large amounts of prisoners, in Desert Storm, we had thousands, tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners that we had to interrogate, we had to assess, and determine if they were worth questioning.   And once we determined that they were worth questioning, most of the time if you asked them a question, they gave you the answer.  It was very surprising to us, to learn that all these techniques really werent necessary because the Iraqis had no training, most of them were happy just to be away from Saddam Hussein.  Very powerful tool.   The ones that did not want to cooperate with us, usually you found some major or lieutenant-colonel in the Republican Guard that didnt want to talk to you, and thats when those techniques became somewhat effective, but there were always ones that would spit at you, because they knew you couldnt hurt them.  They knew the Americans followed the Geneva Conventions.  They knew, that you werent gonna hurt them.  You couldnt touch them.  Until someand I wont use any personal references here, some lieutenant-colonels I know, would throw them down to the ground, pull out a pistol, put it to their forehead and say, tell me what I need to know, whatever the question was, or Im gonna blow your brains out.   That now will get you thrown out of the Army, without your retirement.  Back then it was not common use but it was pretty effective because, its real easy in theory to know that the Americans cant hurt you. But, when the gun is on your forehead, youre not sure if this is the one American that didnt get the memo.  So this can be effective.  Now, I think we', 'we have to be somewhat reticent in applying these forms of interrogation.  But I think we would be foolish, absolutely foolish to outlaw them.  I think the President was right to veto any bill that limits what the CIA can do.   And this is only limiting the CIA, the neutered Department of Defense is already constrained by the Army Field Manual.  The idea is to extend that to the entire government.  I think thats a mistake, we still have to have this tool in our arsenal because some people in the government whove done this for a living, say that it works.  George Tenet said it saved lives, I dont know that to be true, I dont know it to be not true.  But I think we would be very foolish to take an arrow out of the quiver.   And I do think this is an existential war.  And I think it is a war that were gonna be fighting for a long time.  I think we need to apply every weapon we have. [APPLAUSE]', \"Yeah, Ill take that.  Ideally, you want to break any foe.  And Jack goes-- I mean, I agree that rapport building, if you have time, is the best way to go.  The question is sometimes you dont.  The other point is sometimes you dont have the time.   But I believe this foe is a different one that weve ever-- than weve ever faced before.  Were not dealing with a state.   Were not dealing with someone with defined borders.  The people--these are not soldiers in an army.  This is an ideal.  This is a-- these are committed warriors in a religious battle.

I dontIm not sure thats always the case, would you say thats why Al Qaeda in Iraq is being taken apart by the Anbar cooperative group out there, theyre doing it because were gonna kill them, not because were not going to be nice to them.', 'I dont think theres an argument, I agree with what you said.

But many times, you dont have the time to do that, youre not sure you have the time to do that, the biggest problem is not what you know about a suspect, its about what you dont know.   And what you dont know is whats the timeline.  And you have to get to that very quickly.  And if you have any reason to believe that hes got, you know, information of an imminent value, then youve got to ramp up the treatment.   You know, ideally if you think this guy, okay, this is a low-level Taliban guy who probably doesnt know much, lets sit down and talk to him, and find out who he might know, where the training camps here, the routine order of battle kind of stuff youd want to prosecute a war.  But if you grab a guy, maybe bin Ladens driver who was driving a set of orders somewhere, but you dont know where, be nice to know where that is before the action happens.', 'I actually do', 'I was struck by your question, sir, and I really appreciate you asking that, about the moral ground, you know, do we lose by not adhering to the moral high ground.  Trust me, and I think all of us are on the same tier, no one wants to use these techniques as a matter of course.  No one enjoys this, from those of us who have done this, its not a very pleasant experience.  But we dont live in a perfect world.  We didnt create that world, and it is inhabit by people who wanna kill us.  And Im not sure revenge is the factor its their stated goal in life, for whatever reason.   Is this utilitarian?  Yes.  Its the mission of, of the intelligence community and the armed forces to protect the country, through whatever means areis legally possible.  And when youre lucky enough to get your hands on one of these suspectsand its very difficult to do, how do you find them.   These are all very good points.  Once you get your hands on one, you have to be able to get the information you need.  If the rapport-building works, great.  If it doesnt, youve gotta be able', 'to ratchet it up, and get what you have to have.  They cant defeat us militarily, but I am not willing to risk the death of thousands of Americans just on the moral high ground.  I just, you cant have it both ways.']\n",
      "['Thank you very much.  I will argue that stress interrogation techniques are both necessary for getting information from suspected terrorists after 9-11, and effective in doing so.  I will base my arguments on the actual experience of interrogators in Afghanistan and elsewhere.   This is not a debate about torture. The stress methods that interrogators developed, such as short periods of sleep deprivation and isolation, were light years from torture.  And to call them such, degrades the moral opprobrium that rightly attaches to the term.   As my colleagues will demonstrate, the use of stress techniques on terrorists is lawful. The burden therefore falls on our opponents, to explain why legal and essential methods to gain critical information about future terrorist attacks should be off-limits.   It didnt take long for interrogators working in Afghanistan, to realize that the traditional army interrogation techniques were nearly useless against the Al Qaeda operatives and Taliban fighters whom the military was picking up in the fall of 2001.   Those traditional techniques, a set of 16 psychological gambits assembled during the Cold War, were designed to help young Americans, soldiers, debrief Soviet prisoners of war on the battlefield.  The 16 gambits have been crafted for use against conventional soldiers, lowly grunts, conscripted into a state army, who are often only too glad to be taken off the battlefield and out of the war.   Army lore held that 95 percent of lawful prisoners of war would divulge information upon direct questioning.  In Afghanistan, this ratio was reversed.  Virtually none of the terror detainees was giving up information.  Tried-and-true approaches, like appealing to a prisoners love of family, often had little purchase.   If an interrogator offered a jihadist prisoner contact with his wife or children, in exchange for information, the jihadist might respond, quote, Ive divorced this life.  I dont care about my family, end quote.  Unlike lawful prisoners of war, the terror detainees were never off the battlefield.  They continued their vicious attacks against their captors at every opportunity while in detention. Some of the detainees had been trained in resistance techniques, and knew the limits of American interrogation rules.   Others quickly learned what those limits were.  So the interrogators began cautiously experimenting with stress techniques, such as marathon questioning sessions or aggressive behavior, to put a detainee on edge.   The purpose of such methods was to recreate the shock of capture, that vulnerable mental state immediately following capture, when a prisoner is most frightened, uncertain, and likely to give up information.  Uncertainty is an interrogators most powerful ally.  It can lead the detainee to believe that the interrogator is in total control, and holds the key to his future. An interrogator facing a resistant Taliban explosives-maker, for example, might angrily hoist the prisoner up by his collar, and storm out of the interrogation booth.   The detainee had previously understood that American interrogators couldnt so much as lay a finger on them.  Suddenly, he doesnt know what the interrogators limits are.  That frightening uncertainty can change his calculations about whether to cooperate.   According to interrogators inin Afghanistan and Guantanamo, stress worked.  The harsher the methods that the questioners used, the sooner they got good information.   Eventually, the military codified a set of stress techniques for use in Guantanamo and Iraq.  These included keeping a detainee awake at night, putting him on cold Army rations instead of hot meals, isolation, environmental manipulation, and impersonating a foreign agent. All were hedged round with numerous bureaucratic and medical safeguards.  None of the stress techniques that the military approved for use on terror detainees had anything to do otherwise with Abu Ghraib.  Abu Ghraib was the result of the unconscionable and culpable breakdown of military discipline, throughout the detention camp.   Soldiers sprayed graffiti on the walls, engaged in public sexual misbehaver, and operated bootlegging and prostitution rings.  Elliot Spitzer is not known to have used any of them.  [LAUGHTER]  The guards sadistic and sexualized treatment of prisoners was an extension of the chaos they were already wallowing in.   It had nothing to do with interrogation.  Had the rules for prisoner treatment and questioning been followed at Abu Ghraib, the abuse couldnt have happened.  In conclusion, the stress interrogation techniques that interrogators developed to break detainees resistance, were necessary, effective, and lawful.   They were far from torture.  In certain instances asas Bob said, they resembled what army recruits and professionals go through as part of their training.  As a reality check, heres the Senates definition of torture.   It is that barbaric cruelty which lies at the top of the pyramid of human rights misconductsuch as sustained systematic beating, application of electric currents to sensitive parts of the body, and tying up or hanging in positions that cause extreme pain.', 'It would be reckless to ignore the experience of interrogators on the ground, who came up against detainee resistance that was potentially catastrophic in consequence.  Intelligence about terror planning is our only sure defense against attack.  Nothing else matters.   Interrogators facing the urgent need to get life-saving information from terrorists with likely knowledge of future plots, should be allowed to use stress when the questioning techniques designed for lawful prisoners of war are not working.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'I would also say, in one sense, I take John Hutsons argument as really a confirmation of what were arguing because hesyou didnt address stress, you talked about clear abuses of the interrogation rules.  There was no license for stuffing somebody in a sleeping bag and suffocating him to death, that was a violation of the rules, not an interrogation pursuant to them', 'And people that have killed detainees have rightly been prosecuted.  Most of the deaths occurred at point of capture, not in interrogation at that point when you are sort of still at war, and its a very ambiguous state, but in any case, out of the tens of thousands of prisoners that have been taken, 40 criminal homicides iscompared to wars in the past is a pretty low rate, but in any case, we are not arguing for torture.   My side here is talking about stress interrogation and I would say as David does, it is perfectly valid to distinguish between keeping somebody up late that itaccording to the interrogators whove written about this and spoken about this, reversing somebodys sleep schedules does get information, and burning somebody or destroying them and inflicting deliberate severe pain and stress onand suffering on them.  We have to be able to make these distinctions.  And, again, to conflate the murder of detainees which is clearly a violation of the laws of war, with the calibrated use of stress I think, does no service to what we need to be debating in the future in the war on terror.', 'John, to say itsweve let it run rampant is just not true, people that have abused prisoners have been prosecuted criminally. When Abu Ghraib came out', 'there has been', 'There has been investigation after investigation of that.  I would agree, I think Abu Ghraib, there has not been sufficient, responsibility laid on the commanders that let that situation get out of control, I think it needs to go way far up the Pentagon chain of command but it hasnt,  but again, that happened in contravention of the interrogation rules, the interrogation rules, if they had been followed to the letter, they said that every interrogation technique had to be cleared, had to be monitored. What was going on was not interrogation, this was a bunch of deranged, sadistic guards, working in the middle of the night, that were getting their jollies on these prisoners, it had nothing to do with the interrogation rules', '[OVERLAPS]  And, and can I also add something that', 'was already mentioned.  The destructive powerthis is an asymmetrical war as John said.  The destructive power that now lies available to individuals that are not a member of the state, that cannot be deterred as states can is unlike anything that weve faced before.   With the', 'availability of nuclear weapons.', '[OVERLAPS]  Sounds awful.', '[OVERLAPS]  Uh-huh.', 'But Jack, thats a different argument.

And thats the fear, that a small', '[OVERLAPS]  number of people', 'You can-, there is the possibility of', 'nuclear weapons.', '[OVERLAPS]  You dont-, you think its not going to happen?

I'm glad, I'm glad to [INAUDIBLE]\", 'Darius, do you[OVERLAPPING VOICES]  wait[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]', '[OVERLAPS]  Why does', 'I canlet me just argue that, first of all what we are doing is within the rule of law because a terrorist detainee is not covered by the Geneva Convention', 'Andwe are he is covered by the Convention Against Torture, there is no question.  We are obligated to follow the Convention Against Torture, thats why it matters to make the distinctions that Darius refuses to.  We are not arguing torture on this side. And Darius, you seem to think that the only possible set of questioning techniques are these random it was rather arbitrary what got put into the Army Field Manual.  You yourself know, there has been, contrary to the claims on the other side, there has been no serious empirical work on theeven on the Army Field Manual.   Are you suggesting that those are the only possible questioning techniques that can ever be used, and that somehow they are handed down from on high as the absolute way of questioning.   There may have been 12, if Mutt and Jeff had  not originally been included in them, my guess is that if we were now pro', 'proposing', 'Good cop-bad cop', 'you would call that torture as well because that wouldnt be in the Army Field Manual', 'So thats why I think again', 'we need towe need to discuss', 'whether stress is torture.', 'Well, Im just puzzled by the idea that, withif you have Khalid Shaikh Mohammed  in detention, Im not sure what the public cooperation is that youre going to expect to get information from him.  The 9-11 Commission report, youre claiming that interrogation stress did not work.   They said that half of the information in that report came from the interrogation of high- value', 'Yeah, how do youwhy are you disagreeing with the fact that, the interrogation of high-value detainees did produce valuable intelligence that allowed us to', 'Were not allowed to', 'grab somebodys collar', 'Can I', 'It sounds to me like', 'Well, I wasnt aware of Michael Schauers testimony, I would rely on the 9-11 Commission report, I dont know what the relevance of the seconds that people have held out, butclearly we have gotten actionable intelligence from the high-value CIA detainees. What Iwhat I dont understand is obviously we do need to think about this, not just as a utilitarian matter but a moral one.  But why is it necessary, the moral position, to say that, we are not going to use stress on a single Al Qaeda detainee, and risk the possible destruction of hundreds if not thousands of innocent civilians, Ito me itits not clear that the moral position, puts more value on the protecting of temporary extreme discomfort of one person who is pledged to destroy as many Americans as he can, that thats moral to protect him, and to sacrifice thousands of American lives, the idea that stress does not work, never works, is an easy out.  The fact is is that, regimes have usedtorture, again, which is not what we are arguing for today. But even torture, has been shown to work, the French used it in the Algerian war, and they got information', 'they did', 'They used', 'Well, I agree with the opponents that we need as many highly trained interrogators as we can get, they should be as fully versed in language and cultural skills and that hasclearly has been a weakness.  But I would submit that the trained interrogators with the CIA were facing resistance that the existing tools that they had available to them were not able to overcome.   And I dont believe that the 16 army interrogation rules are the only possible interrogation techniques that should ever be available as we face an enemy that is not going to seek revenge because we are using stress, because they wanted to kill us 30 years ago, 40 years ago, and destroy as much as we can.  I think that there are going to be times when', 'stress is necessary.  If we are facing an imminent threat, if we have somebody with, with knowledge of the next plot, were not going to have time to spend the months that it can take to build rapport.   And if using stress on somebody with knowledge of the next terrorist attack is necessary to save thousands of American lives, I think that it is acceptable and lawful and moral to do so.']\n",
      "[\"The critics invariably portray, as you just heard now, waterboarding and other stress techniques as torture.  I would stipulate easily and readily that waterboarding and other stress techniques is a fairly unpleasant practice.   It offends our 21st century sensibilities.  Its something thats difficult to talk about. But I also believe were at war with an implacable and ruthless foe that thinks nothing about killing civilians by the thousands and is seeking to kill millions more.   I don't think anybody would disagree about obtaining intelligence is vital in this war.  And we can debate, theoretically, the proposition that other techniques work, but its a matter of fact.  There are instances where hardened anti-operatives did not prove susceptible to these kinder, gentler techniques, and yet provided intelligence when they were subjected to stressful interrogation techniques.  But my overarching message to you is that this is a policy debate.  It should be a policy debate, which is why asking the question that has been posed today is useful.  The obsession of legalities is not helpful.  The legal definition of torture is necessarily vague.   The torture defined in the 94 statute which was passed to implement obligations under an anti-torture convention, as quote, Intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, both physical and mental.  Much of the legal debate about torture boils down to the question of how severe is severe.  As far as the physical pain and suffering is concerned, its almost certainly the case that some forms of waterboarding have been practiced by the CIA on only three occasions that we know of, with three different high-value detainees, rise to the level of torture.  And some probably, particularly those that did not involve full inundation of the subject do not.  The reason for this is because the physical discomfort suffered by the subject of-, being subjected to this technique while [UNCLEAR] was not severe enough.  As far as the mental severe pain and suffering is concerned, it bears emphasizing that Congress deliberately adopted a narrow definition of the term severe to encompass only, and I quote, prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from the threat of imminent death or mind altering substances.  In my view waterboarding and other techniques practiced by the CIA do not fit this definition for at least two reasons.  First of all, the practice of waterboarding used by the CIA was extremely short, sixty to ninety seconds, which certainly suggests even to our lawyer that its not protracted.  Significant to the question of what is, what and 2006 in the context of two key pieces of legislation when Congress handled-, and once again, the answer was that there has to be some duration, some timeline for something to be considered protracted.  Second, the high-value terrorist being interrogated are perfectly aware that theyre not in any danger of death, that the CIA was after information, their lives were not in danger.  When Congress passed in the Detainee Treatment Act something called shocks the conscience standard, which makes it even harder to argue that these techniques are always, inherently, and absolutely torture, because the shock, shocks the conscience standard, by definition-- and its something that borrows from American case law-- it is inherently a context- specific standard.  It is not something that you would be able to answer in the abstract.  Its also worthy to point out that while the original Justice Department so-called torture memo was perhaps overly broad in its definition of what level of pain and suffering constitutes torture, lots of legal council came up with some more nuanced analysis.  Significantly, ladies and gentlemen, this analysis was developed by lawyers, at least some of whom where critical of the administrations policy.  Indeed, as reported in the media, including by Stuart Taylor of the National Journal, the lead author of the subsequent memo by OLC on this issue was none other than senior DOJ official Daniel Levin, who himself had been subjected to waterboarding as a part of his research.  I know that trusting the gallowman is not an argument most of you like these days, but I would certainly be inclined to trust Dan Levin, who by the way was reportedly forced out by Alberto Gonzales for not being sufficiently solicitous of the White House positions on various other issues.   Now, presented with this argument, the critics claim, Well maybe its not torture, but maybe its cruel inhuman degrading treatment, which is another set of legal buzzwords.  Yet cruel, inhuman and degrading are even more capacious terms than torture.  For some detainees, the mere fact that theyre being questioned by a Jew or a woman is an intolerable humiliation.  Are we supposed to countenance and approve this kind of racist sentiment?   Meanwhile, its also the case that there has to be some reasonable definition of what is cruel, inhuman and degrading, because I would submit to you that there is a degree of humiliation, cruelty, and degradation in any kind of custodial interrogation.   Theres yelling, theres screaming.  Threats are being made against a person or his loved ones.  Andy Fastow of Enron fame was told by his interrogators that his wife would be imprisoned for a long time, and I would submit to you that it was probably a cruel treatment.   So there has to be some parameters of behavior thats clearly-, is cruel and degrading and humiliating, but yet does not violate the law. My bottom line is this: while the waterboarding debate implicates legal issue, we cannot simply abandon the field to the lawyers. The lawyers have no special right or expertise to deal with those issues.  So our duty as a society is to approach these debates seriously, in a mature fashion.   To ask what is really consistent with our values.  Incidentally, weve talked about mistakes.  My good friend John mentioned mistakes.  And yes, shoving somebodys head in a sleeping bag is not a good thing.  But as you may recall, these problems occur in other contexts.  When I was at the Justice Department, one of my responsibilities was investigating various bad things that happened in the Bureau of Prisons.  And let me assure you ladies and gentlemen, in a situation when there is no blessing for stress techniques, instead in fact-- prisoners in federal and civil and state penitentiaries not being interrogated at all have\", 'fellow prisoners who commit horrible things.  You have sadistic guards who do horrible things.  Recently I had a case in Florida', 'involving mistreatment by the guards of a child in a boot camp, where he was basically smothered and suffocated in the course of trying to set him straight.  This is not an easy debate.  We should not focus exclusively on the question of how to deal with enemy combatants.   We should ask a broader set of questions of what level of coercion are we prepared to tolerate in our public policy, something that our government is doing.  We should not come up with one set of regimen for captured unlawful enemy combatants when we waterboard our own personnel.  Then there are things going on other spheres of public life, including as I mentioned, in boot camps that are harsh.  And--, but the last point is whatever we do, we should be honest and transparent about this debate. We should not use misdirection.  We should not talk in terms of, Well lets adopt the same standards as an Army field manual. Because ladies and gentlemen, the Army field manual, by the way, allows the level of Mutt and Jeff technique that does not allow the interrogator playing the bad cop to be disrespectful, to be tough on an individual.  So here we have politicians advocating the level of kindness towards the unlawful enemy combatants that exceeds that thats been adopted with regard to interrogation of criminal suspects.   That is not', 'the good way to deal with this issue.  Thank you.', 'Yes.', 'Brooke, we certainly pay a high price for it but a couple of things need to be mentioned, first of all unfortunately the critics that promiscuously lump together, the kind of ordinary yelling, spittle-flying, psychological pressure, modest, sleep deprivation, and label it with the T word, are contributing to this problem. The notion that we as a society cannot draw nuances, cannot draw distinctions between a tough treatment, which my colleague Darius here referred to as non-torture and true torture, is frankly silly because thats not what we do in ordinary life.  In any other difficult issues.   But more important than that, I am not convinced, Ive heard this argument many times, Im not convinced, Brooke, that the alleged price were paying for this aspect of our policy, is sort of a but-for problem.  Therere so many other things, that unfortunately our friends and allies do not like because they dont take the threat of radical Islam seriously, they dont believe in, in serious use of military power, theyre beyond that.   But if we took that off the table it would make a difference.  But the thing that makes me really angry is the notion that we are helping the recruitment of jihadis because were talking about a culture that countenances, without any problem, blowing up children, torturing American prisoners to death.   See if you tell meyou know, that, were people who are not troubled by that, they think its okay.  But if they ever read about some level of sexual degradation, humiliation being inflicted on somebody by us, that really ticks them off.  I will tell you these are the people who are not gonna win their hearts and minds no matter what we try, I find this argument absolutely absurd, and the final point about how our soldiers are treated. Ladies and gentlemen, our soldiers have been tortured in every single war, since the end of World War II.   So the notion that somehow theres this nirvana, tell this to John McCain.  Tell people in Korea when over 50 percent of American POWs were tortured and starved to death.  Look, we have to do the right thing because its the right thing.  But lets not pretend that its going to impact how our people are going to bedealt with.  By this enemy.', 'You, you', 'If just', '[OVERLAPS]  Let me just--one sentence.', 'Our distinguished colleagues dont have their act together. DAVID RIVKIN Jack seems to be arguing that it is silly to counterproductively use stress techniques and accomplish reliable rapport.  Nobody disagrees.  Nobody would-- be a fool to suggest to promiscuously use stress techniques.  But its equally foolish to say we should never use them.  Because there may be circumstances where theyre necessary.  And the true wisdom lies in ascertaining which one is which, and mistakes can be made.  But wouldnt it be a mistake, Jack, to just take something entirely off the table?', 'Do you think that everybody is subject to', 'to the', '[OVERLAPS]  Theyre seeking', '[OVERLAPS]  Theyre relentlessly seeking', 'Can I just say very briefly, let the record show, that nobodys arguing on our side in favor of torture.  The shame, frankly, the fault lies with the critics that damn everything with the T word and paint with a broad brush.   Were not talking about torture. Were talking about the level of coerciveness and unpleasantness that permeates our spheres of public life without drawing any opposition from anybody.  You tell me why in order for us to occupy the moral high ground we should eschew, give up, whatever verb you want to use, a level of coercion that is routinely used in other areas, including training of our own troops, specialized and advanced training, federal and state penitentiaries, boot camps for juvenile offenders.  That makes no sense for us as a society to-- instead of having a common baseline that is not torture--to have privileged, uniquely privileged-, only one set of people, captured Al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists.  If that is morality, its silly.  The', 'II', 'But thatswith all due respect, John, thats not all that the Army Field Manual does, my favorite example is, and I wish I had it in front of me.  If you look at the definition of a good cop versus bad cop, theres a restriction on how bad a bad cop can be.  The bad cop cannot act in a manner thats disrespectful to the person being interrogated.   I would submit to you its not a question of violating the law on the domestic side.  In virtually every police station, the bad cop is pretty damn disrespectful to the drug dealers and rapists and muggers.  Were talking about using the rules were not using in our criminal justice system.  That John is absurd, its insanity.  Its not morality', 'But hes citing selectively.  The Army Field Manual', 'What  Bad cop does not yell?', 'Spittle is not flying', 'Threats are not made', 'Two very good questions', 'Whyall right', 'Why do you claim, that false, misleading information and lying only emanates from people who are being interrogated stressfully, the last time I checked, every criminal, every terrorist routinely lies and your job as an interrogator is to sift the truth from fiction.   Isnt it the case that the biggest problem is, when a person says nothing, zero, nada.  Not the fact that somebodys lying because you have enough time to cross-reference things, you can learn as much from lying, as from a person doing truth- telling, but everybody lies.', 'Bad guysbad guys lie', 'But thats a straw man, nobody is suggesting that this administration, much-maligned, has used  [LAUGHTER]  has used the stress interrogation techniques, against very few high- value detainees.   And whether or not a given individual as Jack suggested, was more of a braggart, or, versus a real mastermind. He wasnt innocent, the few people who were subjected to those things were anything but innocent.', 'I dont think', 'Go ahead', 'John, were not talking', 'here is what you are suggestingfirst of all, you guys dont have your act together.  The two people on both sides are making a utilitarian argument, it doesnt work, we dont need it.  Youre making an absolute argument that there are certain things called torture that you should never do.  Actually we agree.  The question is this, are we gonna be a mature society, have a serious discourse about what is or isnt torture, its distasteful, but its necessary, are we just going to clap our hands and say everything is torture. [OVERLAPPING VOICES]', 'But wait a minute, it doesnt work so it must hurt them more than it helps them', 'We are facing a very serious threat.  One of the reasons that is the case, its not a question of numbers, its not a question of technology, its the question of dedication.  Its been decades since we fought people, who no matter how twisted and warped the ideology is, willing to commit the most inhuman acts, sacrificing not only themselves, mothers bringing their children up to die.  Expressing pride at that.   The force of that compulsion, of that conviction, is tremendously dangerous.  I would suggest to you that weve heard a lot of emotional statements today.  In my opinion not emanating from our side of, of this equation, but I ask you to use your rule of reason.   We as human beings are all about making nuances, whether were dealing with our kids, our co-workers, dealing with our government.  The humanwhat weve heard repeatedly from our opponents, is, extolling you not to try to draw distinctions, not to try to rule the rule of reason.', 'But basically, adopt a rigidunyielding framework, suggesting that anything that deviates from this framework, but degrees of coercion, which by the way are practiced in the criminal justice system, would absolutely allow most criminals to go free, because wed not be able to suggest them to any psychological coercion, or frighten them, or their family members in any way.  That is not the way America has gotten to where it is.  This is not the way youre gonna lead your own lives, this is not the way youre gonna lead your professional lives, why should you lead that approach as citizens of this great body politic, use the rule of reason, and dont worry about anecdotes about Spanish Inquisition, or the Iranian secret police.']\n",

      "['Thank you very much.  And first Id like to thank Bob and Alexandra and Dana for the terrific job theyve done in turning this debate series into reality.  And Id like to thank all of you for showing up on such a miserable evening to hear a debate about what I do think is one of the most important issues that we could possibly talk about.   No doubt many of you are asking yourselves tonight, why should America take on the thankless task of policing the globe.  To answer that question, start by asking, does the world need a policeman.   Thats like asking whether New York City needs a police force.  As long as evil exists, someone will have to protect peaceful people from predators.  The international system is no different in this regard from your own neighborhood, except that predators abroad are far more dangerous than ordinary robbers, rapists and murderers.   They are, if given half a chance, mass robbers, mass rapists, mass murderers.  Without an effective police force the world community would fall apart faster, and more completely than New York City did in the 1970s. There are to be sure lots of international laws on the books prohibiting genocide, landmines, biological weapons and other nasty things.  But without enforcement mechanisms they are as worthless as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which outlawed war as an instrument of national policy, 11 years before the Vermacht rolled into Poland.   The hope of idealistic liberals for more than a century has been that some international organization would punish the wicked.  But the League of Nations was a dismal failure, and the UN is not much better.   The best multilateral alternative is probably NATO.  But from Bosnia to Afghanistan we have seen time and again that NATO has trouble acting effectively.  In fact five retired NATO generals have just issued a report that bemoans the absence of a properly defined political objective, the absence of an integrated strategy to achieve that objective, and the absence of capabilities to implement the strategy.   Now that doesnt mean we should abandon NATO.  It does mean we should have no illusions that its European members can fend for themselves.  So who does that leave to be the worlds policeman.  Belgium, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Bangladesh? I think the answers pretty obvious.  Its the country with the most vibrant economy, the most fervent devotion to liberty, and the most powerful military.  In the 19th century, Great Britain battled enemies of all mankind such as slave traders and pirates, preserved the balance of power on the continent, and kept the worlds seas open to commerce.   Today the only nation that can play an equivalent role is the United States of America.  Allies will be needed, but America is, as Madeline Albright said, the indispensable nation.  Now skeptics will reply that America has an isolationist past, and no desire to past globo-cop.  But rumors of American isolationism are greatly exaggerated.   Since the earliest days of the republic American traders, missionaries and soldiers have penetrated the farthest corners of the world, and they have a long history of upholding civilized norms.   I am reminded in fact of the words spoken 104 years ago, by a great New Yorker.  He said, Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation. And in the Western Hemisphere, the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power. Now when Teddy Roosevelt spoke those words, the Western Hemisphere was the only place where the US exercised military hegemony.  Today America exercises almost as much power everywhere around the world, as we once had only the Caribbean.   In fact we have more power than any other state in history.  Thus, by Roosevelts logic the US is obligated to defend civilization, and that is precisely what we are doing.  That is why American troops have fought in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq to uprestore the rule of law and uphold human rights.   That is why American troops are still stationed from South Korea to Germany, to prevent aggression and a return of dangerous rivalries.  That is why the US Navy patrols the worlds oceans, to prevent the closing of checkpoints at chokepoints, such as the Straits of Hormuz. And thats why numerous agencies of the US government work to combat terrorism, and to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction.  That is what being the worlds policeman is all about.  Of course we cannot right every wrong, nor intervene everywhere.   We have to use prudence and judgment in the exercise of our power, something we have not always done in recent years.  But Americas occasional missteps should not lead us to abdicate our indispensable role, any more than the NYPD should stop doing its vital work, simply because cops occasionally do the wrong thing.   On balance, the NYPD still does far more good than harm, and so does the United States of America.  In fact America has been the greatest force for good in the world in the past century.  Just think of what happened when we did not act as globo-cop.   Think of what happened in 1914, in 1939.  By contrast, think of what happened when we did act as globo-cop.  Think of what happened in 1945, and 1989. American intervention made possible the defeat of Nazism, and Communism.  American isolationism made possible the outbreak of two world wars. As these examples demonstrate, there is nothing altruistic about our globo-cop role.  As the worlds most prosperous country, and as a country that depends for its prosperity on the free flow of people, capital and products, we are the biggest beneficiaries of the liberal international order that we safeguard.   Compared with the benefits that we gain the financial costs are trivial.  We currently spend 4% of our GPD on defense, a lot less than the average during the past four decades.  That 4 cents on the dollar preserving international peace and stability is a bargain.   Now I imagine that the other side will claim that our international policing function makes us hated, and leads to greater violence against us.  That is sometimes the case and I will be the first to admit it.  But we are as often reviled for not acting, for not stopping the genocide in Rwanda or Darfur, for not imposing peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.   And yes, there is a cost to be paid for action, as weve learned in Iraq.', 'But there is also a cost to be paid for inaction.  During the 1990s we ignored our policing responsibilities in Afghanistan.  As the civil war raged between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance, our leaders said in essence what Britains leaders said in the 1930sthat there is no reason to be concerned about a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing. Well on 9-11 we found out why we should care.  The answer can be seen a few miles from here, where the World Trade Center once stood.  9-11 shouldve taught us that we cannot ignore potential peril, nor count on others to protect us.   We must safeguard ourselves, and not simply by launching retaliatory strikes after thousands, perhaps millions have perished.  We need to play a proactive role.  We need to police areas of unrest, and to do what we can to bring decent government to war-torn lands.   If we fail to act, we, as the mightiest nation in the world, will pay the heaviest price.  I therefore urge you to heed Theodore Roosevelts admonition, and to vote in favor of America exercising an international police power.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'If I gave you the impression thatthe alternatives are either unilateralism or isolationism Ithats, thats false, and in fact I tried very hard not to give that impression because what I talked about was not necessary unilateralism, it was American global leadership, and as I said, we should try to act with allies wherever possible.   We should certainly not go it alone unless its absolutely necessary.  But in certain circumstances it is absolutely necessary, and even with allies we cannot simply do what the herd wants, we have to provide leadership.  We saw in the case of Bosnia for example in the early 1990s what happened when American global leadership was absent.   And that was genocide occurring and it was only when we stepped forward and mobilized our allies in the way that a policeman might mobilize a posse that we were able to be effective, so', 'Well, I would say to you', 'Well, in the first place', 'Well, in fact I would argue that a lot of our interventions have worked out reasonably well and I think for example of World War II or the Gulf War and more importantly I think of the consequences of not in intervening, for example the fact that we did not intervene in Europe in the 1930s, I think that failure speaks for itself.', 'How many debaters do we have onon the other side there. [LAUGHTER]', 'Well, Id like to ask a question of Matthew Parris and I am tempted to ask if you know what the words ad hominem mean but I will refrain from asking that', 'Instead I would like to ask about your fascinating claim that you have great knowledge and power to intuit the feelings of the American people which is denied to those of us who actually live here.  [LAUGHTER]  And I would like to ask you, therefore, why you claim that the American people will not support this role of global policeman if in fact they have supported American troops being stationed in East Asia and Europe for over 60 years and why you think that Republican and conservative voters in particular, do not support an interventionist role for the United States when they consistently back Presidents and Presidential candidates such as Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush', 'and John McCain who are in fact leading advocates of intervention', 'Well', 'There was a question mark at the end', 'I guess I would reply thats a little bit like asking well what do we do about the fact that John Gotti doesnt like the NYPD in his neighborhood.  Well, you have to deal with those issues, and sometimes you have to deal with them diplomatically and obviously nobodys suggesting that we start a war with Russia or China because we dislike some of their behavior.   But, youthe problem with the position that your side takes which is multilateralism is that basically, you hold us hostage to the views of a Russia or China, you basically say, we cannot act by leading a coalition of the willing, we cannot act with our posse, we have to wait for some multilateral institution before we can do something  and of course, Russia and China have vetoes in the most powerful multilateral institution that exists and they use their vetoes to shield wrongdoers such as Iran developing nuclear weapons, or to try to prevent us from intervening for example in Kosovo to stop the genocide.   So if you pay too much heed to the opinions of countries like Russia or China or other dictatorships which dont have the best interests, our best interests at heart or the worlds best interests at heart, basically you allow the worlds worst criminals free rein.  And thats something I dont think we can afford to, to let happen. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, I dont think that you can come up with any hard and fast criteria, I think a lot of what you do has to be really based on a realistic assessment of your capabilities at the moment, and nobody suggests that for example, that, if you haveif you saw murders occurring in New York City that therefore, the New York Police Department is a complete failure.   Obviously there are going to be crimes occurring in the world.  We cannot stop all of them, its beyond our means, everybody will admit that.  But I think we have to do what we can.  And I thinkIm with Bill Clinton when he said that it was a mistake not to have intervened in Rwanda, not to have stopped a genocide that it was in our power to stop, I think, it was correct that we did intervene in Bosnia and Kosovo and we stopped terrible bloodletting in the Balkans.   Today obviously our forces are engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq and we dont have the capability to intervene as many including me would like in places like Darfur.  And thats a sad, tragic reality, which means that hundreds of thousands of people are dying.   But of course, even if we dont have the capability to lead an intervention with massive use of force we can do other things such as using our global leadership role to push economic sanctions, or to provide enablers that might allow others to intervene, but unfortunately for all the talk from the other side, about how there are so many others out there willing to play this global policing role, we find time and time again, theres been very few cases of anybody willing to step forward where the United States does not lead and,  Im in favor of American leadership while recognizing the limits of our power and the fact that we cannot possibly intervene in every case, I think we should try to do as much good as possible within the bounds of our power.', 'Can I just jump in and just make one point?  Because I think in your question and some of the others I kind of scent this notion of American declinism in the air.  And the fact that wereWoe is us.  Were over-stretched.  We cant do everything that we want to do.  And I think you should be aware of just how vast our power is.  The fact is that we spend more than the rest of the world, or as much as the rest of the world combined, on defense.  And were still spending only four per cent of our GDP, which is several percentage points less than we were spending during the Cold War.  We still have the worlds largest and richest economy. Weve been creating jobs at a pace that out-clips any other industrialized economy over the last twenty or thirty years.  Our population size is growing.  Were already the third largest country by population in the world.  And were projected to increase by another hundred and fifty million over the course of the next fifty years.  There are vast pools of power and resources in the United States that can be mobilized for the task that we have to undertake.  And in fact, we have mobilized them in essentially policing the world over the last sixty years.  It is a very doable mission.', 'Well, Id like to begin by addressing the question that was just asked because I think its an important point.  And by no means do those of us on this side advocate waging perpetual war.  In fact, what I believe is that if America takes seriously its global policing responsibilities that makes war less likely, not more likely.  When you think simply about what an urban police force does, for example  cops on the beat walk the beat.  They dont fire their guns very often.  And the more theyre out there, the more they have a presence the more they deter crime and the less, uh, likely it is that criminals will prey on innocent people. And they can have their greatest effect simply with the same kind of, uh, street corner presence that we expect here in New York City.  And thats essentially what the United States has been doing around the world for more than sixty years, where our navy keeps the Straits of Hormuz open.  They patrol the worlds ocean to prevent pirates or other predators from disrupting the flow of global commerce.', '[OVERLAP]  Our troops are stationed in countries like Japan and South Korea and Germany and elsewhere to prevent conflict, to deter conflict from occurring.  And all you have to do to realize why this is a good thing is just to imagine the consequences of a world without American leadership.  I mean, imagine arms races spiraling out of control in East Asia and Europe.  Imagine Iran closing the Straits of Hormuz.  Imagine chaos and civil war spilling over the borders of Iraq and Afghanistan into neighboring states.   Imagine terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons.  Now, you may think Im being melodramatic but, in fact, I think history shows the dire consequences of America abdicating its global policing role.  And if even ten percent or a third of the things that Im talking about are likely to happen if we give up this policing function, its an unacceptable risk.  And we can afford the, the, uh, global policing function which we have performed.  It is not bankrupting our country.  It is a very small share of our public purse.  [UNCLEAR]', 'We have to continue in order to prevent the very wars that all of us decry.']\n",
      "['Thank you.  You will observe that some of the things that I have to say overlap some of the things that Max Boot said.  This is so, I daresay, not only because great minds run in the same channel, but also because the things on which we agree are true. [LAUGHTER]  All societies, when they become sufficiently interdependent, need governance.  The society of states, the society of sovereign countries has reached that point.  The international society needs governance and the United States provides it.  The United States provides to other countries some, although not all, of the services that governments provide within the countries that they govern.  This, as it happens, is the thesis of my 2006 book, The Case for Goliath:  How America Acts as the Worlds Government in the 21st Century, that the organizers have very kindly provided outside this room.  [AUDIENCE REACTION] Hmm. [PAUSE] The United States provides order to the world, as governments must, in two ways.  First, economic activity within countries requires a secure backdrop.  Government protects commerce and enforces contracts.  The United States does this in the global economy.  American military deployments and the American alliance systems assure the free flow of trade and the movement of capital across borders.  This economic activity known as globalization, and made possible by the American role as the worlds police force, has brought benefits to hundreds of millions of people.  Second, the United States helps keep order in the world by leading the effort to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of groups or individuals that would deploy them in ways antithetical to the interests not only of the United States, but of the world in general.  The United States leads the effort at global nuclear non-proliferation.  And in these two ways above all, the United States acts as the worlds police force. Now, to this argument at least three objections may be made. And weve already heard one of them.  One objection is that the United States does not carry out its policing duties as well as it should.  As Ellen Laipson said, the United States is not present everywhere and doesnt act perfectly.  And this is certainly true, but neither does any police force.  Every police force is subject to criticism, legitimate criticism.  But criticizing a police force is not the same thing as arguing that there should not be one.  A second objection to the motion is that it would be better if global policing were carried out, not by the United States, but by other countries or groups of countries or international organizations. Now, I daresay if the proposition were put that way to the American public a majority of them might agree.  But it is the fact, as Max Boot noted, that there is no other country or group of countries that is willing or able to take up the burden of global policing.  And as for international organizations, they are far too feeble to do so, and that emphatically includes the international organization to which some would like to assign the task of global policing  the one whose headquarters is located a few blocks from here  the United Nations.  So the alternative to the United States as the worlds policeman is not a better international order.  It is more international disorder.  Well, a third objection is, what about Iraq?  Well, the American military operations in Iraq really have two parts.  The first part involved removing a tyrannical government and insuring that neither it nor a tyrannical successor would possess weapons of mass destruction. The second part of the operation involves trying to construct a stable, decent democratic government in that country.  The first task which falls within the purview of global policing was successfully accomplished.  The second has not been done so successfully.  But the second task  whats wrongly called nation building and should be called state building  is not an example of police work.  Its an example of social work.  The United States is not good at social work but it doesnt have to be to perform as the worlds police force.  So to oppose this motion you must believe one or both of two things.  You must believe either that the world does not need policing or that there is some better source of global policing than the United States.  There is, I submit, no reason to believe either.  And I will add, by way of conclusion, that there is one group of people with a keen interest in global order and extensive familiarity with the American role in the world that emphatically does not believe either proposition. I refer to the worlds governments.  They could, if they chose, circumscribe or abolish altogether by banding together to oppose it, the American role as the worlds policeman.  But they have done and shown no signs of doing any such thing.  And the reason is that they understand and appreciate the benefits that Americas role as the global policeman confers upon their countries and on the world as a whole.  So whatever the verdict of the people in this house, the governments of the world above all, by what they have not done, have voted in favor of this motion. Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Do Matthew Parris and I not get the questions, have we so intimidated you that youre not gonna ask us questions? [LAUGHTER]', 'Well, congratulations', 'Not at all, Im delighted with them, I think we should have more of them, I think the United States should support them, but they add up to only a small fraction of the policing thats necessary in the world.  In fact, I claim that the United States does police the world and does do so effectively and let me give you three examples.   In East Asia, contrary to what Mr. Bremmer said, the United States does a very effective job of containing although not preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons by North Korea, with the Seventh Fleet, with its security treaties with Japan and South Korea, without them, East Asia would be a much more dangerous place.   Similarly, in the Persian Gulf, although the United States has not dealt with complete success with Iran, our military presence over the horizon and our naval presence assures the free flow of petroleum which is a global necessity.   A policeman walks the beat.  The United States does that in the Persian Gulf and in East Asia, its extremely important that it do so.  To the extent that other countries can chip in, all the better. But they just dont do enough, and I dont have any expectation that they will.', 'Well, Id like to make a comment', 'Well then IllIll turn it into a question.  [LAUGHTER]', 'Mr. Parris gave, I would say a rather broad view of American anti- imperialism but not altogether inaccurate so let me give a reply in a similar spirit and it follows onto what Ellen Laipson said and my response.  I would say in response to you comment about American opposition to the British empire', 'Its a question.  We thought  [LAUGHTER]  We thought we could do it better than you did.  But we were wrong.  Come back. We would be delighted for the British to do more by way of global policing, so will you, as an influential member of the political class in Britain, commit to agitating in favor of the Royal Navy growing larger rather than smaller so that it can resume the policing of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean that it did so well and so necessarily and with such great benefit to everyone, including that large free-rider across the Atlantic, the United States, in the 19th century.', 'I answer it as follows.  The United States as the global policeman is not as legitimate as the New York City police force is.  And it cannot be because there is no global government, no global state to give it legitimacy.  But it has enough legitimacy, because nobody opposes it, as they would if they didnt like it and felt threatened by it.   Indeed, as I say in my, my book The Case for Goliath, [LAUGHTER] I think there is a threat, there is a threat to the American role as the worlds governments, but it doesnt come from other countries.  It comes from the mounting costs of social welfare, of our entitlement programs, the great threat to the American role as the worlds policeman and to global order comes not from Chinapace Mr. Bremmerit comes from Medicare. AUDIENCE [MURMURS FROM AUDIENCE]', 'Ah.', 'The United States can continue to act as the worlds policeman as long as serious countries do not actively oppose it.  And that means that since there is no longer a Cold War, it is in many ways cheaper for the United States to carry out the legitimate police functions in the world that it does carry out.   And it carries them out, with the sufferance, with the tacit agreement of major countries, including Russia and China, that disagree with the United States on some important issues, but still value the American role at least to the extent that they do not oppose it.', 'I dont think a draft would solve the problem.  And of course the military doesnt want a draft, and the United States carries out its policing role without a huge mass army of the kind that great powers fielded until the last third of the 20th Century.  But I do agree, and I did say, that this is a substantial problem and does present a threat to American foreign policy.  And if it results in the curtailing of the global services that include providing a global police force, the whole world, including those who most harshly criticize American foreign policy, will be sorry.', '[OVERLAP]  [UNCLEAR]  Youve answered it.  Youve already answered the question.  Why dont you answer it again?', 'Some people in New York  possibly including some people in this room  are unhappy.  [AUDIENCE REACTION]  The New York Police Department cant help you.  Morley Safer noted that despite the presence of NATO forces  and incidentally, if you want to see just what Americas allies are willing to do in a cause with which they agree, check out their performance in Afghanistan.  Its pretty pathetic.  Despite, Morley Safer has noted that drugs are still traded.  Theyre still traded in New York, within a few blocks of here.  Thats not an argument against New York having a police force.  And what is true of New York is true of the world as well.  The fact that the United States cannot bring Chechnya to a successful resolution is not an argument against the United States acting as the worlds police force. The job of a police force in the world, as in New York, is not to make things perfect.  Its to keep things from becoming worse. And that the United States does in the world in two important ways  by its military deployments and alliances that undergird globalization and by leading the effort against nuclear proliferation and deterring rogue states if and when they get nuclear weapons.  Those are important global tasks.  They are the tasks of global policing.  Other countries and other organizations have shown no inclination to do them.  Therefore it is in everybodys interest that the United States continue to do so.  That is why you should support this motion.']\n",
      "['Okay, thank you, thank you very much, its very good to be here. And thank you for listening to me, its good to be another Brit here, partly, partly so that you dont all think that Brits think like Matthew Parris  [LAUGHTER]  Its an odd position to be in, perhaps some of you think to have somebody from another nation coming along to you here and saying, effectively, please police me  A strange misquote of that wonderful thinker Engelbert Humperdinck  [LAUGHTER]  But  [LAUGHTER] But its not quite as masochistic as it sounds when we talk about the worlds policeman, a lot of people assume up the idea of force, and that you have the right to do it because youre powerful. I dont think that is what the reason is, that America has the right to be and should continue to be as it currently is the worlds policeman.  Its not your force as a nation which I think allows you that right, its Americas virtues that allow it that right.  Its the fact that, when America goes into a country like Afghanistan or Iraq, you dont do the things which previous great powers did, that the moment, if anything this is a failing, if anything, when you go into a country like Iraq, you dont say how long can we stay here, but how soon can we get out.   You want to dabble as little as possible in the world--I think thats a virtue.  You know when you have to intervene.  But you also know when you have to get out.  But, uh, to clear up some of the mistakes from other side already, just because youre the worlds policeman doesnt mean you dont have allies.  It doesnt mean you dont have friends and others who will do the job, wholl join you in the job. America in the last few years, despite the caricature of her greatest enemies, is not the unilateral organization that a lot of people would portray her as being.  Now, as my two colleagues and comrades on my side have already intimated to you, there are really only two reasons not to vote for the right side if I may, in this in this motion.   The first is that you think that the world does need a policeman, but that someone else can do it. Someone else will step up for the job.  Weve heard quite a lot at the moment, uh, from people talking more I think in glee than sorrow about the rise of China, for instance.  You can look in your papers any day and see what the rise of China would bring in its wake if you wanted them to police the world, look at the athletes for instance going to the Olympics, being, attempting to be forbidden from speaking out about any Chinese abuses whilst theyre there. You want a perpetual silencing like that across the globe?  You dont see America trying to do that, you dont see America trying to silence her enemies.  America is the only force I can think of which tolerates people standing up against it, shouting as loudly as possible, picketing its military institutions and all this kind of thing permits that.   Think of another world power that would permit that kind of thing, or another policeman that wouldnt object when people continue to rejoice in poking it in the eye. Who else might be on the horizon?  You might see, theres a lot of talk for instance at the moment about Saudi Arabia.   We have a lot of talk about that in Britain at the moment with our Archbishop of Canterbury, or soon to be promoted to the Grand Mufti of Canterbury.  [LAUGHTER]  Saying that he wouldnt mind Sharia law in Britain, I was sitting opposite a clerical goon two mornings ago in London who was explaining to me,  Sheik Sewit Hassan [PH], what the sharia that he would like to bring to Britain would be and that, yes, we should cut off hands, we should stone women to death, because it would teach the others, and he hadnt seen any adultery in Saudi Arabia.  And I pointed out you dont actually often see adultery happening, but [LAUGHTER] But you might get those kind of global systems if you, if you wish it hard enough, if you wish hard enough for America to fall, for America to be poked in the eye.  But what will you do, who will sort out these problems, who will sort out a problem like Iran, when you have years of talks and the only progress youll really hear of is Iran getting closer and closer to its desired objectives of nuclear power.   So thats the first reason, the first reason why you would vote against this motion, the second, is that you think that the world doesnt really need a policeman.  It will be just fine without one.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is, I think, a terrible, terrible illusion, its a siren call which has called across history to people.   It called to the people of Athens two and a half millennia ago when Demosthenes warned them of the threat from King Phillip and said you do have other people who will tell you, if you ignore this threat, you will save money, and youll be able to spend it on other things But, I know that if you listen to them, you will one day wake up, and youll realize how much this optimism cost you.  Youre in the same position today, ladies and gentlemen.  As people have been throughout history, as the personthe famous journalist who before the First World War wrote that, war in Europe was now an impossibility, because it was so economically unviable. Well it turned out to be more unviable for more reason than economics and people did it anyway.  You will not be able to live in a world in which no one acts as your policeman.  And let me cite one example of where the virtue of American intervention has been cited already by Max Boot, is not only necessary but vital and Id cite the case of Kosovo.   This might well come back again and again later.  But, when the concentration camps in Europe reopened in the 1990s in the Balkans, and when we saw an ethnic genocide, an ethnic cleansing, from a third-rate tin-pot dictator and the European governments couldnt stop it, who was it who had to stop in.', 'It wasnt France, France provided us with a phalanx of lawyers, and a leak.  America provided us with 98% of the worldthe air power, and they stopped a genocide, thats no small achievement, ladies and gentlemen, I willcould go through all of the things which Ellen Laipson said, of the problems that you have enforcing, as nobody says that its good being the worlds policeman, nobody says its enjoyable, nobody would want the job.  Other than people who you wouldnt want to have the job. And, if Matthew Parris  Its always wary when somebody opens with compliments.  [LAUGHTER]   Mr. Parris describes my cause, our sides cause, I think your cause is a doomed cause.  If it were a doomed cause, ladies and gentlemen, if my cause were a doomed cause, it would mean that our cause as a civilization is a doomed cause.  It is I think too early to try to give up like that. Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, Ill tell you one', 'Sure, well I can tell you one thing it can do and has done straight away which is that Afghanistan is no longer a base where there are open training camps where terrorists can train and come and attack cities like this one were sitting in.', 'And thatsI dont think, I dont think thats a small achievement.', 'I think thats a different question', 'Well, hang on, if you let me finish.  OrI thought it was one question.  Look, as I said its no small thing to get the first thing done, the thing that was originally why America and her allies went into Afghanistan which was to take out flagrant training camps of terrorists, and that job has been done.   Now it seems to me that the job of sorting out the Afghan economy is a separate one, one which the world community generally is involved in, but I think thats a different point.  I dont know if you wanted to try to make me an apologist for the American administration or a spokesperson for them but Im not.', 'My own, my own view for what its worth on it is that the job of creating a viable, booming economy in Afghanistan is a quite different one, now this particular policeman went in and sorted out the problem.  It doesnt also have to be the Social Services Department.', 'Thank you', 'Gosh, I dont have any lack of questions for the other side, but the one Id most like to ask is Ian Bremmer, who mentioned, I just pricked up about the Pew polls, about what people across the globe think of America.   And aside from the vaguely unpleasant sight of anyone caring that much about how much theyre liked I wonder if youve seen the Pew polls about suicide bombingpeople who are in favor of suicide bombing as a tactic, across the Arab and Muslim world, particularly, legitimizing vast percentages the murder of Israelis.   And whether youve seen the Pew polls that show the number of people across the Middle East and elsewhere, the huge numbers of people who think that for instance 9-11 was a conspiracy, forced on the American people by their own government, by Mossad and all this sort of thing. Based on all this, do you think that this is all Americas fault, or do you think other people have agency and the ability to cock up.', 'Can I also add to that?  Theres a confusion going on at the moment here, between policing and being an imperial power. Which is going to I think, cause a problem on the voting at least for this side.  Which is why I mention it, being a world policeman in the definition that were going on at the moment is quite different from being a world authoritarian.   And to go back to Ellen Laipsons definitions when she said that, the definition of policing would be enforcing the rules, setting the rules and having a monopoly on the use of force   America does enforce the rules, they tend not to be ones set by themselves, they tend to be set by all sorts of other organizations and nations in history. And America certainly doesnt have monopoly on the use of force as for instance the intervention in Sierra Leone by my own country would demonstrate.   But I would just tidy that up, just because youwere saying on this side that, that we would like America to be the worlds policeman does not mean were suggesting that it is like the British Empire was, or that its like any other empire, I dont think it is an empire, being a policemans quite different. MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER There are a lot of nasty conflicts in the world at any given time, so this is a question for those who support the motion.  Whats the criteria for the, the United States to intervene as policemen, would that include Kenya today, would that include, Mozambique, would that include Darfur, would that include Rwanda in the early 90s', '[OVERLAP]  Yeah, I mean, just to get back to this point is that, I think that I can speak for people on this side and just say that again, that the policing issue, it doesnt  First of all, it does not have to be primeonly military.  And I think thats my, thats fairly obvious.  And even a member of the other side conceded, Americas role in operations like the post-tsunami operations a couple of years ago.  And I think that, as I say, this should be cleared up before you vote  that the issue  and I think I mentioned it in my comments earlier, that the issue of, for instance, sustaining an operation, remaining in a country and all these sort of things, is not what we are talking about as policing. That policing operations are not welfare operations, as I mentioned earlier, but are also not imperialist operations. Theyre not even operations which, people might think of sustaining for the long term. MAN If I could just, could I just --', 'Thank you.  Id like to start off by mentioning something Ellen Laipson said that she said some time earlier, that the rest of the world is providing the actual police.  And one of the reasons why that may be the case is because you as a nation are the ones that are doing the heavy lifting.  Its not hard for Canada or somebody to not be able to provide troops, but to be able to provide policemen.  Its not hard for Germany to send legions of people to Afghanistan who wont fire a gun.  You can find those people. Who are you going to call?  This is the question that we should have in our minds.  When something goes wrong, when a tsunami occurs, when a massive humanitarian catastrophe like that, when a rogue state emerges, when a failed state becomes an even more failed state or a successful one starts to fail who are you going to call?  Is it going to be another nation state?  Or is it going to be the U.N.?  Matthew Parris mentioned the U.N.  The idea of the U.N. policing the world is like saying that you just pick a cross section of every household in New York and say that that house will do the policing and that one and that one.  In other words, an entirely random process which will mean youll get a certain amount of people who are fine but you wont get the driven people.  You wont get the people who are prepared to do the job, who are trained to do the job, who are financed to do the job. Youll get some people who can do it accidentally.  Youll also get some bums and some lazy guys and some guys who are just wicked and others.  And thats what the U.N. is composed of, is a whole group of people who you would give more legitimacy for the simple fact that theyre there?  And you know, this comes back to this issue I raised earlier about America wanting to be liked.  You can police the world, you can be the worlds policeman.  You should not be, it looks extremely bad to look like youre desperately wanting to be loved by the rest of the world as well. You will be blamed when youre the worlds most powerful nation. You will be blamed when you intervene and you will be blamed when you dont.  You will just have to put up with that.  And when the other side says that the great should not be the enemy of the good, I dont think anyone on this side would be or has implied that it would be.  But the great should certainly be the enemy of the bad.']\n",

      "[\"Well, let me start by saying, for those of you who might be confused, I am not Ben Johnson.  [LAUGHTER]  On the train ride from DC this morning, we passed through Baltimore.  Doing so reminded me of one of my favorite authors, Baltimore native H.L. Mencken, who I think would have had a good laugh at the hypocrisy, the posturing, the uh, moral prudery thats associated with this steroid controversy.  Eighty years ago Mencken aptly summarized this debate when he wrote, quote, The urge to save humanity is almost always a false face for the urge to rule it.  So why are we here tonight?  Is this about saving sport, or is this about some people imposing their view about what sport should be?  If were here to talk about fairness in competition, I'm dubious.  Take representative Tom Davis, one of the more cam-, camera hungry politicians to demagogue this issue. After the 2000 census, Representative Davis maneuvered to have his Congressional District gerrymandered to include as many Republicans as possible, ensuring his continual reelection, eliminating the real number of options for his constituents to vote.  He ran the next year unopposed.  Davis also snuck a, a provision into an unrelated piece of Federal legislation preventing an apartment complex from going up in his district because, he told the Washington Post, he feared it would bring too many Democrats into the district.  This guy is cheating at Democracy, and hes lecturing baseball players about fairness.  If we want to talk about the health risks of professional sports, we might discuss the ballooning weight of NFL lineman over the last twenty years, or the corresponding life, drop in life expectancy thats come with it.  Or you might talk about the particularly hellish world of thoroughbred horse racing jockeys, who subject themselves to sweat boxes, diuretics, suppositories, and intentional eating disorders.  In fact, any world class athlete subjects his body to stresses it wasnt really designed to endure. And as weve seen with government bans on consensual activity, from alcohol to gambling to cocaine to prostitution, prohibitions not only dont work, they make the activity in question more dangerous by pushing it underground.  So what about the children?  Survey data actually shows that teen steroid use has mirrored the use of other elicit drugs over the years.  It went up mildly in the 1990s, and has since either dropped off slightly, or leveled off since 2000.  Its likely that the same trends that govern cocaine or marijuana use govern teen steroid use far more than whats happening in the sports pages.  In fact, a study released last year, and one of the few studies to actually attempt to find out what motivates teen boys to take steroids, found that the most reliable indicator of steroid use was a teens own self, self esteem and body image.  The suggestion, and I think we can all agree its pretty intuitive, is that teenage boys who do take steroids do so not because they want to look like Barry Bonds or Mark McGwire, but because they want to look good for teenage girls.  So what is this debate really all about?  Id suggest its about paternalism, and its about control.  We have a full blown moral panic on our hands here, and its over a set of substances that, for whatever reason, has attracted the ire of the people who have made it their job to tell us what is and isn't good for us.  Our society has an oddly schizophrenic relationship with pharmaceuticals and medical technology.  If something could be said to be natural, we tend to be OK with it.  If its lab made or synthetic, we tend to be leery.  But even synthetic drugs and man-made technology seem to be OK if the aim is to make sick people better, or broken people whole again.  And so when we talk about expanding or transcending what we consider to be normal, uh, then a certain uneasiness starts to set in.  There was an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education last month about university professors taking stimulants like Adderall to increase their academic productivity.  Oddly, the article quoted, quoted several professors who considered this cheating at academics.  I have to confess, I really dont understand this way of thinking. Academics is the search for truth and knowledge, if a drug can make that search more productive with few side effects, why in the world wouldn't you take it?  Its also important to note that what we consider completely natural and acceptable today was quite out of the ordinary not too long ago.  A hundred years ago life expectancy in the US was fifty, today its seventy-eight. Thanks to technology, medicine, and pharmaceutical, were today taller, stronger, faster, healthier, and expecting to live longer than ever before. Genetically advanced agriculture, anti-aging technology, and other advancements weve yet to see today will likely push our longevity even farther.  Its an old clich that sports is a metaphor for the human condition, but theres a lot of truth to that.  As technology helped humanity obliterate a lot of these milestones, and helped us move beyond what, until a hundred years ago, had been a long, bleak history, similar advances over the years in nutrition, training, and using technology to improve technique have enabled sports records to fall with astonishing regularity.  Sports is about exploring and stretching the lengths of human potential.  Going back to even the pre-modern Olympics, when athletes ate live bees, and ate crushed sheep testicles to get a leg up on the competition, uh, sports has never been about physical ability alone.  Its been, been about ingenuity, innovation, and knowledge about what makes us faster and stronger, and avoiding what might do us harm.  Its always been part of the game.  It shouldn't be surprising, then, that many of the biggest proponents of banning performance enhancing drugs in sports are also suspect of some of these continued advancements in human achievement.  Leon Kass, former, formerly President Bushs top advisor on bio-ethics, this is the same Mr. Kass who champions rigorous sports testing, has also spent much of his career actually lamenting the fact that human beings are living longer than ever before.  He considers this contrary to some odd concept of natural order.  Uh, of course there have been luddites and naturalists like Mr. Kass standing athwart the tide\", \"of human progress for much of human history.  The essence of the agreement today I think is what people like Mr. Kass and some of our opponents tonight, they have a decidedly different definition of whats pure, natural, and human than what I do.  I think the difference is that I'm sort of willing to take a live and let live approach and let everyone sort of explore their own boundaries and their own potential.  Um, whereas I think some of our opponents are more interested in opposing their view of what is natural and what is, uh, human on everyone else, which of course brings us back to Mencken.  I think, uh, our opponents want to legislate away what they believe are bad decisions, and if a free society means anything, it means we should be able to make all decisions, including the bad ones.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]\", 'Well, II agree, um, I think werewhat were debating tonight is what the rules ought to be, um, Im not advocating, uh, uh, Im not defending the people who have been caught cheating, I think, uh, I think Mr. Pound is right, when you enter into a league and you agree to, to compete, uh, you agree to a predetermined set of rules.   Um, but I think tonight what were trying to determine is, is what those rules ought to be.  Um, and I think that, you know, I think that athletes, uh, care about their bodies and they care about their, their earning potential.  Uh, they care about the next season, and I think they are going to seek out a competitive advantage, but theyre not going to do so to the point where, they jeopardize future earning potential or they jeopardize the next season.  I think, I think people, uh, have, I think athletes have a little bit, uh, more respect for their bodies than that.', 'Well, I mean and if, if the, you know, US Olympic Committee wants to, to, uh, set those rules, uh, you know, I, I, I think there are important distinctions to be drawn, uh, uh, between amateur athletics and professional athletics but, uh, you know, II think, uh, a couple ones, I think  First of all I think, private leagues and private sports, uh, professional sports organizations should be able to set their own rules, Im not advocating, uh, that Congress mandate to the, the NFL that they have to allow performance-enhancing drugs.  Uh, but I also think, dont think that its any business of Congress telling leagues that theyre they have to ban them as well, uh, I think that, uh, uh, the league should be able to set their own rules and I think the people will, uh, athletes will, will, uhlobby to get the rules that both reflect their desire to get a competitive advantage but also protect their health.', 'I was referring to, there was a cover story on Sports, in cover, Sports Illustrated a couple of years ago about the lengths that jockeys go through to, to make weight.', 'Right, the jockeys, not the horses.', \"But, but were talking about what the rules should be, and, and I'm interested, as a former player, of your opinion, if, if its true, that the side effects of HGH are minimal, particularly when compared to steroids, and it does help, I mean, these are people, athletes are people whose livelihoods depends on, on basically what amounts to physical labor, right?  And if a guy can, uh, get back into the game quicker because of HGH, is that any different than a, you know, a construction worker who wants to get back on the job quicker because his pay check is dependent on it, taking something, a drug that has minimal effects that helps him recover quicker?\", 'Well, what about the athletes who have the funds to travel to Colorado Springs to train in high altitude versus low income athletes who might not?  Uh, you know, there, there are built-in advantages and disadvantages.  I think actually making a, uh, a cheap, a relatively cheap drug that mimics that effect, like EPO, which is much, much cheaper than, you know, flying an athlete out to Colorado to, to train at high altitude, um, actually democratizes, uh, that effect.  I dont think it actually, uh, makes it more difficult, uh, to achieve parity.', \"Sure, my, uh, question is directed at George.  Um, lets say for the sake of argument that the, the names that you mentioned during your presentation did die directly as a result of their using steroids.  Uh, during alcohol prohibition people drank alcohol that was, uh, wood alcohol, uh, they drank alcohol that was, gin that was distilled in bathtubs, toxic, nasty, nasty stuff.  The reason they drank is because safer, cheaper, um, better alternatives weren't available at the time.  Uh, once prohibition ended, you know, nobody drinks bathtub gin anymore.  Uh, nobody drinks wood alcohol anymore.  Um, assuming that all these deaths were tied to steroids, all these deaths occurred during a period where steroids were illegal, and were still prohibited.  So, they were prohibited its entire time, people were doing them anyway, why not lift that veil, let people who are going to do it anyway get steroids from, from a doctor, get steroids from more reputable distributors so they dont have to go to Tijuana. Maybe it wasnt steroids itself that killed them, maybe it was the fact that it was some black market steroids that they weren't being, um, advised by a reputable doctor.\", \"Well, I guess my point is, if were talking about the safety of athletes, isn't it better to have this all happening above ground and in the open air\", 'Lets say, lets say alcohol then.', 'Should we ban alcohol for adults because kids are going to drink it?', 'whats the difference?', 'Youyou can probably guess my answer, umuh, just a very, very quick anecdote, when baseball first objected to the, the, uh, Congresss jurisdiction to look into this matter, uh, Congressman Davis and Congressman Waxman sent a letter back to baseball, stating that Congtheir, their particular committee, the Government Reform Committee, had jurisdiction over any matter at any time.   Uh, this is the, the sort of arrogance of Congress, they think that theres nothing that they dont have authority, uh, and jurisdiction over.

Now granted she broke the rules.  But, were in asort of a feeding frenzy about this at this point and its a, its a common tactic or its a common phenomenon, uh, when drug issues hit the media, uh, things tend to spin off into a moral panic.

      "['Thank you.  Everyone in this room uses performance-enhancing technology and drugs. We use cars and computers to make our work more efficient.  We use caffeine, alcohol, and Viagra to improve our performance.  We send our children to fancy schools and Suzuki lessons to improve their cognitive skills, and enhance their musical ability. And every athlete in recorded history has used performance-enhancing drugs.  Babylonians and Romans used herbs to improve their performance in battle.  Naked Greeks put on shoes to run faster.  Kenyan runners trained at altitude to improve their oxygen-carrying capacity.  And runners everywhere carbo-loaded before races to enhance their performance. Why then, do we have a replay of the Salem witch trials?  To discredit, humiliate, and incarcerate, uh, elite athletes for doing what has been a standard practice for millennia?   And why, out of the thousand and one ways in which athletes enhance their performance, have steroids and growth hormone been selected for particular vilification?  The short answer is that theyre illegal and that these athletes are breaking the rules and perhaps the law, and therefor its immoral. But this begs the question, as Mr. Rosenkranz said, why are they banned in the first place?  We contend that the reasons given are morally incoherent, wreak of hypocrisy, and are based on ice cold wrong information. I will identify six reasons that are offered why we should ban these drugs.  Number one, critics say that they confer an unfair advantage.  But advantages are only unfair if theyre unequally distributed.  The usual solution is to expand access. When Bob Seagren showed up at the 72 Olympics in-, with a fiberglass pole, it was not banned, but, a-, uh, there was a time to allow others to practice with it, and it was incorporated.  When Kenyan runners were found to enhance their performance by raising their hemoglobin by training at altitude, the reaction was not to ban abnormally high hemoglobins, or to prohibit others from training at altitude, but to encourage everyone to do it. The unfair advantage aim, uh, the unfair advantage claim is further undermined by rampant hypocrisy.  In the 88 Olympics, when Ben Johnson lost his gold medal because of steroid use, on the same day and the same press den, Janet Evans, the American swimmer who had won the 5k swim, bragged about the greasy swimsuit that we had kept secret from the East Germans. Johnson used a drug that was available to everyone, although illegally, virtually on the training room tables.  Evans used a secret technology available to none of her competitors and bragged about it. The press cheered American ingenuity and made Johnson a pariah.  Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, preaches about a level playing field, but presides over a league where the Yankees payroll is three to four times that of most competitors, including my beloved Brewers, [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] and guess what?  The Yankees always make the playoffs. Two, critics say these drugs are harmful, but they rely on information thats wiley-, wildly exaggerated or just fabricated. We are told repeatedly that these drugs use heart disease, cancer, and stroke, while human growth hormone has been given to almost a million children for fifty years, and theres still no real serious side effects that have been discovered.  Oral testosterone dis-, did cause liver cancer, but for twenty years athletes have been using injectables, which have never been associated with cancer. Lyle Alzado the football player, was a poster child for the horrors of steroids.  He died of a brain tumor.  Then the New York Times and Sports Illustrated told us on cover stories that this was due to steroids without a single quote from an informed physician or a single source showing any association with steroids, because there is none.  But still, Costas, I mean, excuse me, [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] uh, Alzado[LAUGHS]', \"ehAlzado is constantly rolled out as a poster child for the horrors of steroids.  I ask you in the audience to quickly name, in your own minds, a single elite athlete whos had a stroke or a heart attack while playing sports.  Its hard to come up with one. Anabolic steroids do have undesirable side effects: acne, baldness, voice changes, intrangent infertility.  But sport itself is far more dangerous, and we dont prohibit it. The number of deaths from playing professional football and college football are fifty to a hundred times higher than even the wild exaggerations about steroids.  More people have died playing baseball than have died of steroid use.  Three critics say that allowing their use is coercive, that youre forced to use them.  But the first year that baseball did universal testing, anonymous testing, only six percent of the players were positive. From those numbers, it seems that 94% were able to play at a very high level and didnt feel coerced at all.  Coercion is the use or threat of force that's never occurred in this country to the best of my knowledge. There is no entitlement to play professional sports; its a privilege requiring an enormous sacrifice and taking on enormous risks, with or without steroids.  Many walk away from it and choose not to do it, and no one is forced to take it on.  Four, critics claim that steroids undermine fan interest, and this is simply empirically false, baseball attendance has ridden steadily in the steroid era, professional football is even more popular, and Barry Bonds, widely assumed to be a steroid user, is the biggest draw in sports, adding ten thousand fannies in the seats everywhere he goes.  Chicks love the long ball, guys love the long ball, they dont care what they're using.  Fifth, critics claim that steroids undermine the integrity of records.  This is nave, the records are not comparable with or without steroids or growth hormone. Baseball fences are shorter, the mound is lower, the ball is livelier, and Coors Field is a mile above sea level.  By one estimate, Babe Ruth playing in todays ball parks would hit a thousand home runs, not the mere seven hundred and fifty that Hank Aaron and Bonds have hit.  The only valid comparison is with peers playing in the same arenas with the same equipment against the same opponents, and Ruth hit more home runs in one season than any other team.  He is in a league of his own, and no one has come close.  Finally, critics claim that steroids present bad role modeling for children\", 'Everyone agrees these drugs should be banned for children.  The adverse effects are different, they stunt growth, they are not competent to make informed choices.  I support testing in schools, not to punish the kids, but to catch the peddlers. Anyone caught selling drugs to children should be hung, followed by a fair trial.  [LAUGHTER]  In closing, when you go out to dinner tonight, enjoy the wine that relaxes you, or start your day tomorrow with a double mocha latte that gets you going, but please be less critical of others who, like you, try to enhance their performance in a variety of ways.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Nobody knows but my guess is it would be exactly the opposite.', 'Because if athletes could go to doctors and get drugs without having to go to Mexico or to BALCO Labs, they could A, get drugs which had been studied and tested and approved by the FDA, theyd know what they were taking.  They could get drugs that would be manufactured in an American manufacturing facility with oversight by the FDA, and theyd be getting advice from doctors on which drugs were safe and effe effective, which now they cant find out even if they want to because the stuff comes from Mexico.', 'Uh, whatever a doctor would prescribe to them and probably some would go outside the system as they do now', \"Yeah, thats what theyre doing now, the difference is that youd have drugs which could be tested, youd have follow-up studies so that they would know what the facts are. Youd know whether any of these deaths that George Michael refers to have anything to do with steroids.  As he said, theres no evidence that they do. But there are other adverse effects of steroids that I would worry about, but well never find out about them, because we can't study them.  So, I think athletes might be more constrained from using them if there was more data out there that they could know about.\", 'George, George, theres a, for three years in the NFL theres a ninety percent chance of permanent disability.

And he said the reason I used it was because I had injuries, the my doctor said my injuries could heal faster, um, which is true, thats the way these things work, they let you to repair injuries faster so you can train harder and get back on the field.  If Roger Clemens said that, if Ben Johnson said that, if they all said that, which they equally could have said, I used them because they help me heal faster, would that have been, are you OK with what Petitte said, and would you be OK with them?  And I want to ask\", \"Well just first, as a doctor, I dont understand what medicines about if its not about trying to help people recover from injuries and heal, and if you're\", \"And if you have a, if you have a drug that doesn't, has almost no side effects, and it helps people heal, I dont know how it differs from anything else that\", 'Second one, Dick Pound, um, a lot of the discussion here has been about fair competition.

I didn't know the debate topic was, should athlete be allowed to break the rules. No is the answer.  OK, thats the end of that debate.  The question is, why the rules are there. Why do we have a rule that prohibits a doctor from prescribing a drug that helps you heal that has no side effects?  Where did that come from?  I haven't heard an answer to that yet.\", 'All athletes want to get back out there and work out and get back on the field as soon as possible.', 'Yeah, what it, what it enables them to do is to train harder and to recover from injury quicker, and thats why they get better.

Most of the adolescent use is in the gyms, not in the playing field. But listen, alcohol kills fifty thousand people a year, and what are the big leagues doing about that.  When players drink, I don't hear anybody talking about lifetime bans for drunk driving by baseball players.  That kills fifty thousand people a year, including innocent victims, including a lot of kids, and here we are talking about something that kills almost nobody.

So, I wonder whether you advocate insider trading, umuh, in that, in that way, because it clearly gives us an advantage.  My other point is to the kids, and its been brought up by the side against the motion and that is, why should my son, who at eight years old, who already watches Barry Bonds, when he gets to the high school level, and theres a kid who plays second base, whoshe knows is taking something,  and all he wants to do is play second base on his high school baseball team, he may not even wanna make it to college or to the pros.

The topic thats here for debate tonight is, what are the basis of those rules.  If there was a rule prohibiting people playing with red hair, we would say of course if you have read hair you cant play.   But we wouldnt say that that was a sensible rule.  So rules have to have some moral basis or some rational basis.  The fact that they simply are there doesnt tell us anything about the basis of them.  When we look at what the claims for them are, they seem hypocritical, inconsistent, or based on bad facts.   People say theyre based on concerns about fair competition, but sports allow grossly unfair competition, Olympic sports, countries against countries, baseball, Yankees against Brewers, the leagues tolerate unfair competition, so I simply dont believe them when they say theyre passionately concerned about fair competition.  They say theyre concerned about harm.  When the president of the', 'National Hockey League, says that hes has screening for drugs because hes concerned about the safety and health of the athletes, and theres no laughter in the press room, you have to really wonder about whats going on.   Uh, if you have good arguments you dont make up things.  We have Lyle Alzado being rolled out again tonight, three times.  Theres not a doctor in America who knows anything about steroids and cancer who thinks Lyle Alzados tumor had anything to do with steroids. Theres not another steroid user ever who had the kind of cancer he had.  So if the headline had said Lyle Alzado, Alcohol User, Has Brain Cancer, I guess wed be talking about alcohol causing brain cancer.', 'So the need to roll out misinformation over and over again suggests theres not much going on the other side.  Thank you.']\n",
      "['The finest, uh, Italian cyclist, Fausto Coppi was once asked, and winner of the Tour de France was once asked, uhhow often had he taken la bamba, or amphetamines during his career, he said, only when absolutely necessary.  And when asked precisely how often that was he said, almost always.  [LAUGHTER]  Another Tour de France, Jacques Anquetil in a debate with a French politician said, what do you expect us to do, ride the tour on mineral water?  Where our team agrees with, uh, Dick Pound and, and, uh, the opposition is that this is really only the tip of the iceberg.   The war on drugs has failed, drugs have always been present in sport, and were only seeing probably less than 5 percent of the drug-takers being caught.  Not only has it failed, it must fail.  Growth hormone is extremely difficult to detect, blood doping is also extremely difficult to detect, and in the future well have gene doping.   Insulin-like growth factor can be injected into muscles, to improve muscular strength, it would have to be detected with a muscle biopsy.  Uh, science has created super- mice capable of running six, uh, kilometers instead of 200 meters, by altering their glucose metabolism.   Theyve created Schwarzenegger mice with vastly stronger muscles and marathon mice capable of running much faster marathons, these could all be done in humans.  We will not be able to detect these changes. Not only is the war on drugs bound to fail, uh, it also has other adverse effects, it reduces interest, this year, uh, in the Tour de France the race leader Michael Rasmussen, was, uh, sacked by his team on allegations of taking drugs.   Theres always a cloud over winners, of whether theyre taking drugs or not.  Its unfair, the honest athletes are penalized because theyre denied access to safe performance enhancers and of course the rich can buy the undetectable enhancers.   They can buy hypoxic air tents for 7000 US dollars which are legal, whereas EPO, which is banned, costs only 120 US dollars a month.  But most of all its unsafe. What happens is theres pressure to develop undetectable performance enhancers with no eye to the safety.   The BALCO scandal illustrates what a back yard situation we have at the moment.  What is policy and the current zero-tolerance approach to drugs in sport, is inconsistent and confused.  External technologies like hypoxic air tents, or altitude training, are acceptable, they raise the red blood cell level, yet if we do this directly by retransfusing our own blood, blood doping, or using EPO, a natural hormone, thats illegal.   Yet they all have exactly the same effect.  Some enhancers have been permitted in sport. Caffeine increases the time to exhaustion, or reduces the time, uh, increases the time to exhaustion by 20 percent.  It used to be illegal, athletes were stripped of their medals for taking caffeine, its now legal, and it hasnt corrupted the spirit of sport, it hasnt had the effect of creating violent mutant gladiators, as the opposition has suggested.   Creatine also increase the time to exhaustion by 10 percent, its also legal.  Tour de France riders use intravenous nutrition to give them enough calories, uh, overnight, and of course Tiger Woods has used lasik eye surgery to give him better than 20/20 vision.  None of these have had adverse effect on sport.   One of the major arguments is that its against the spirit and integrity of sport, Dick Pound wroteraised this issue.  When Dick Pound was asked in an interview with the New York Times which performance enhancements he thought were against the spirit of sport he said, its like pornography.  You know it when you see it.   Well of course D.H. Lawrences novels were thought to be pornographic a century ago, theyre not now. Professional classical musicians regularly take beta blockers to reduce, trim and enhance their performance.   The music sounds good, its not against the spirit of music.  The spirit of sport is entailed in what sport is, its the display of human physical excellence.  Indeed, just as we can increase the artistic expression through the use of beta blockers to enhance musical performance we could use them to enhance performance in archery, or indeed, in many, uh, sports requiring control of anxiety.   Ben Johnson famously said, the human body was not meant to run at the speeds its asked to run today.  To recover from the grueling training necessary to run those times you need steroids to increaincrease recovery.   And of course, Tiger Woods has used lasik eye surgery, and that hasnt been seen to compromise the spirit of golf.  To say that we should reducedrugs in sport or eliminate them because they increase performance, is simply like saying that we should eliminate alcohol from parties because it increases sociability.   So our proposal, is that we allow a modest approach.  We allow performance enhancers which are safe, and consistent with the risks that athletes already entail.  Youll notice that Dick Bou Dick Pound has had to reel out examples from the 60s of deaths from steroids, when they were taken orally.   And indeed the blood doping deaths all occurred in the 90s before the International Cycling Union set a maximum hemhematocrit of 50 percent.  No athlete today is dying in competition from taking EPO.  Indeed I would prefer to take growth hormone prescribed by a doctor, than compete in professional American football, because I know of no ventilator-dependent quadriplegic caused by taking growth hormone.   The drugs need to be consistent with the spirit of an activity, creating webbed hands and feet, which is possible, which is possible, would compromise the spirit of spearing swimming.  But allowing athletes to recover from injuries consistent of sport.   We should set limits, as the International Cycling Union has done, on the hermatocritand test health, not test for drugs.  It makes no difference whether an athletes hermatocrit goes from 46 to 48 percent, by altitude training or by taking EPO or blood doping.  Its a waste of time trying to detect [UNCLEAR]', 'Drugs in sport, far from being against the sport, embodies the human spirit.  We are not horses or dogs, flogged to display our maximum biological potential, the spirit of being human, is to make choices.  To be human is to be better.   To make, to make choices, and performance enhancement as weve argued per se is not against the spirit of sport, it embodies the history and spirit of sport.  Its true that cheating is ruining sport.  But there are two ways to reduce cheating.   One is to ramp up the war on drugs which is bound to fail, the other is to change the rule, the rules to allow regulated, supervised access.  We agree that you should hearadhere to the rules.   But the rules will provide a better spectacle, protect the athletes health, narrow the gap between the cheaters and the honest athletes, if we allow access to safe performance enhancers.  One of the greatest advantages of allowing, uh, the, the access', 'the access to performance enhancement is the, the limited funds that are used by what are $22 million, could be better devoted to detecting those drugs which are seriously against athletes health, rather than wasting time on substances that do not harm their health, and are actually already a part of the sport.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Can I?', 'So what, if this is the honest athlete, and this is the cheater, at the moment the cheater has a significant advantage.', \"So, so what will happen if you allow access to safe performance enhancers is the honest athletes will come up, but of course the cheaters will still take, as you suggest, an advantage in the black market.  But what you will be doing is narrowing the advantage that the cheater has, because now theres a market for safe performance enhancement.  So youve made the honest athletes better off by bringing them closer to the cheaters without compromising their health.  That's the reason why you want to create a market for safe performance enhancers.  So growth hormone, we heard all this discussion about steroids, growth hormone is a very safe substance.  Now, you may be able to achieve a lot of the benefits that you can achieve with steroids by using growth, growth hormone.

Dale Murphy said it would send the wrong message to children, and, and Dick Pound said, uh, you didn't want your children or anyone elses children becoming chemical stockpiles.

So, my question to Dick Pound is, dont we have, already in society, different rules and laws for children and adults, so on your argument, um, we should ban everyone from driving motorcars, because some children may illegally drive them and kill themselves.  So, my question to you is, do you think we also should ban driving cars in adults because it might be abused by some children?

Is that ais that aa hypoxic air tent.  This is what all US athletes use to, to boost their', 'Okay, both sides agree that cheating is ruining sport, and that this is really the tip of the iceberg.  Their position is that we should increase the war on drugs, our position is that we should adopt a policy of regulated access to performance enhancers that are safe enough, and that are consistent with the particular sports spirit.   This is not a debate about steroids.  If indeed, these claims which are largely anecdotal claims are true, that steroids have these terrible effects, our side grants that steroids under those circumstances should be banned.   However, that doesnt deal with the use of human erythropoietin up to a hematacrit of 50 percent, it doesnt deal with caffeine which is already a performance enhancer thats been legalized, it doesnt deal with growth hormone.  There are many, many substances, in baseball, you could use Modafinil to increase reaction time, you could use new neutropics such as the Piracetam family to increase reaction time.  These substances may well be safe enough.  The question is should performance enhancers be allowed, and there are many performance enhancers, our side believes, which should be allowed.  Their position is bound to fail, it has been failing, it will fail because the prize money and the sophistication of the drive to technology', 'Paradoxically, it harms athletes.  Our proposal is enforceable, it frees up the limited resources to focus on drugs that may be affecting children, which we grant should not have access to drugs, it could be focused on drugs which are substantially un un harmful to athletes, and drugs which hare against the true spirit of sport.   This is not a debate about steroids, its about whether performance enhancement itself is against the spirit of sport.  As weve argued, performance enhancement is not against the spirit of sport, its been a part of sport through its whole history, and to be human, is to be better, or at least to try to be better.']\n",

      "['Hello, well first of all, uh, let me thank the Intelligence Squared, uh, for having this debate.  And, I personally as an African, I find this very amusing that I can see proponents for and against, uh, aid.   And I think those of us on this side, really believe that, you have to separate the humanitarian impulse, from the record of aid itself.  I mean on the humanitarian impulse, we all wanna help, as a matter of fact, a lot of people here say that it is the moral obligation of the rich to help the poor.   But the record on aid has been a disaster.  And thats what a lot of us do, of us on this particular side of the table, want to change.  And what were saying is that, look, the current system of aid harms Africa.  And I think John McArthur said that, no, uh, there, there, there are a new group of people   He calls them the cheetahs, I disagree. And, uh, he believes that, aid can be reformed and help the African people.  Butfact of the matter is, more than 600 billion has been poured into Africa since 1960, with nothing to show for it.   Except the marketing of black elephants and crumbled infrastructure and decaying buildings.  There are a couple of misconceptions about aid that we need to clear up.  First of all, aidforeign aid is not free.  It is a very soft loan.  Which is given to a government.  Onat concessional rates.   Now the second thing about aid is that, aid is tied.  80 percent of US aid to Africa is spent right here inin America.  On American contractors, American suppliers, and so forth.  French aid is even worse. [LAUGHTER]   When China gives you aid they dont just send you materials, they also bring in the labor, and, and, uh, materials and, you know, set up towns for their workers for example. Nowone of the things which has been missing in this piece, is that, nobody askedwhom at all do we want to help in Africa, nobody asked that question.  It is assumed, that if we give aidif we gave aid to Africa, automatically, it will help, lift the people out of poverty.  And this is one of the reasons, its one of the fallacies of aid.  Its one of the reasons why its so difficult to come up with success stories, of aid in Africa.  We can find countries, that the US aid has been able to reform politically, we cant find countries where US aid has been able to reform politieconomically.  Right now as we speakout of the 54 African countries, only 16 of them are democratic.  Less than 10 can be characterized as economic success stories.  Forget about intellectual freedom. That is in the Stalinist era.  What Africa needs, and as a matter of fact I testified before the Senate of Canada this past June.   And what I laid before them, yes, they want to help Africa.  But they themselves, came up with a report, Canadian report, Senate report, of 40 years of Canadian aid failure in Africa.  What to do. Now were not suggesting, now dont help Africa.  But if you want to help Africa, folks, please, for Petes sake, ask the Africans what they want.  Dont assume that you know better than the Africans. What Africans want, three things, reform, reform, reform.  Reform the abominable political systems, reform the abominable economic systems, and intellectual systems, give Africans the freedom, so that they themselves can decide what is good for them.   Such freedoms are lacking in Africa.  So to me, this debate reallyis, currently, the aid system is rotten, its not helping the African people.  And if you want to help the African people, what Ill propose to you, and this is what our side is coming up with, is smart aid.  Smart aid is that which empowers the African people to instigate reform from within.  The ruling elites are not interested in reform.  We all know what the problems are, bloated bureaucracies.  Corruption!  We want to trim government expenditures in Africa.  The elites are not interested, you ask themto cut government spending.  And they will set up a Ministry of Less Government Spending. [LAUGHTER]   Now this is the hippo generation, they are not interested in reform.  You ask themto curb corruption, and like in Kenya, theyll set up an Anti-Corruption Commission.  But then, when it snakes too close, they sack the, uh, corruption czar, and shut the whole thing down.   Africans know what they want.  And if you want to better help the African people, ask them.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, first of all, let me address some of the comments made by C. Payne Lucas.  And that is, look, take Nigeria, for example, please do not minimize the issue of corruption.  It is a very serious problem that we have in Africa.  Take Nigeria for example. Between 1970 and 2000, more than four hundred and fifty billion in oil revenue flowed into Nigerian company coffers.  Now, according to Nuhu Ribadu, the chairman of Nigerias anti- corruption commission, of that amount of money, four hundred and [UNCLEAR] billion was stolen by Nigerias military rulers. Thats a huge amount of money.  Sure, certainly we can point to Ngozi, who has been a reformer, but what did the Obasanjo regime do to reward her?  They sacked her.  And now.  If you look across Africa as a whole, the African Union itself says that corruption alone costs Africa one hundred and forty-eight billion dollars every year.  Now, thats more than five times the foreign aid Africa receives form all sources.  So, the issueas a matter of fact, Africa doesnt need aid.  The aid resources Africa needs can be found right there in Africa.', \"I didn't say that.\", \"Sani Abacha was worth five billion.  Babangida, eight billion, you can go all the way back.  Now, this didn't start, OK, recently, is start all the way back since the 1970s.\", 'Please, let the Africans', 'Let the Africans decide for themselves how bad corruption is. And that sort of comparative analysis doesnt help us.  If you try to place corruption within Washington context, for example, suddenly there is corruption, um, in DC, in DC government, and now the latest toll is that, you know, forty-three million dollars have disappeared because of tax fraud.  But please, dont compare that to Africa.  Let the Africans themselves determine the incidence of corruption and how important it is to them.', \"Well, the United States, the, um, World Bank, United Nations can be helpful, um, in reforming, try to help Africa reform.  But in the past theyve been more of a hindrance.  And that is one of the, look, if you want to reform Africa, theres six basic institutions that you need.  Number one, you need an independent and free media.  Thats the first critical institution.  Americans take their media for granted.  The second institution that you need is an independent judiciary for the rule of law. The third institution that you need is an independent electoral commission.  Five, four, I'm sorry, you need a, um, independent, you need to have an independent central bank.  And then you want to have a neutral and professional armed forces and an efficient civil service.  Give Africans these six institutions and it would do most of the cleaning out of Africa.\", 'Yeah, um, I um.  I think, in the beginning paragraph, statement, she made a very interesting, uh, observation, and that is the complexity of this issue.  You know, the way the question itself is framed doesnt really allow us to address that.  And the fact of the matter is, look, I personally believe that Africa doesnt need aid, and I have stated this.  That Africas begging bowl leaks horribly.  I mean, you pour in aid, it just leaks out.  Number one, corruption.  Take the amount of aid which goes into Africa every year.  The total, from all sources, twenty-five billion dollars. Compare that to the leakages.  One hundred and forty-eight billion in corruption lost.  Eighty billion in capital flight out of Africa every year.  OK?  How much money does that, do African governments spend on the military and to purchase weapons? OK?  Fifteen billion.  How much does Africa spend a year to import food?  Twenty billion.  Back in the 1960s, Africa not only fed itself, it exported food.  OK?  If we are able to plug all these leakages, well find more than enough money than, than double the aid that Tony Blair, Tony Blair and Bono are going to give to Africa.  OK?  Thats my position.  But aid has become an industry replete with its own lobbies.  OK?  They want that to continue because aid, if you, if you ask George Soros he will tell you that aid benefits the donors more than the recipients.  They, they would like to have this thing continue.  OK?  What to do?  All right, this is where I say that if you want to ask the Africans, ask them what type of help they need.  And this is where I believe that the mechanism that we have today, its not working.  It has to be reformed so it benefits those that it is intended to do.', 'Let me speak briefly to John, and that is, its true, you pointed out these success stories, but to me these success stories are really cleaning up the mess that past aid programs created.', \"I have been to the villages myself, we are setting up malaria-free zones in villages.  I have visited villages in Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, we will establish, uh, we give, uh, villages malaria, I'm sorry, anti-malaria drugs, bed nets and so forth.  Everywhere that I got the villages tell me one thing, one thing that they tell me is this, look, governments have failed them.  The government says, come around, around election time, to campaign, canvas for their votes.  As soon as the vote, elections are over, they dont see them again.  So they're asking you for bed nets, they're asking you for anti-malarial drugs because their governments have failed them.\", \"Well um, first of all, corruption is not an issue that the US should fight, its Africans who have to fight that battle themselves.  OK? And uh, number one If you want to fight corruption, [CLEARS THROAT], there are three basic institutions that you need.  The first one, you need to have a free and independent media to expose it.  Thats how you solve the problem.  Thats the first thing that you do, expose the problem.  The second is to have an aggressive Attorney General to prosecute the corrupt.  The third institution that you need is an independent judiciary to enforce the rule of law.  We dont have many of these institutions in Africa, and thats why I told you, I said that theres six basic institutions that you need, an independent judiciary, and an independent media, free, free, an independent free media.  Uh, some of the institutions that we need to fight these battles ourselves.  Now, I'm not saying that, you know, corruption, that all African governments are corrupt, there are some which are honest, OK, the government of Botswana, for example, uh, its a very transparent government which is doing very well, there are also some African countries which have made progress, uh, in stemming the tide of corruption.   But thats not the issue, look, sometimes, American experts focus on the small success stories and ignore the larger picture.  Okay, the World Bank was, you know, sort of, uh, been, uh, adept at this, you know, pointing out to economic success stories in Africa, ignoring the larger pictures like, you know, the Congo, Somalia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Nigeria, countries which have collapsed.   Now, let me also  You asked me a question what should Iuh, what would I do, instead of, uh, foreign aid.  I have indicated that the aid resources Africa desperately needs can be found in Africa, I coined the expression, African solutions for African problems.  Were not going to go to America, were not going to go to China, were not going to go to France, were not going to go to Britain and beg and beg, because this devalues our pride and dignity.  And this is why I said that the solutions to Africas problems, lie in Africa itself.\", 'All right, um  The question that Id like to, umuh, ask, is this. And, and to the other side is this.  We have heard about a lot of, um, humanitarian talk, now let me put this directly to you, um, and Mr. C. Payne Lucas, since you have been involved in Africa. Whom exactly do you want to help in Africa.  The African governments or the African people.  Now theres a distinction between these two.  Most Americans think that, the best way of helping the African people is by handing money over to their corrupt and incompetent governments, where do you stand on this.', 'Well, I think your question supplies its own answer.  And that isif corrupt governmentsare making poverty worse, and I think the object of aid is try to remove those corrupt governments, and not to hand money over to them and sort of, uh, strengthen them.   Because, we know in the past, foreign aid simply propped up these bad governments.', 'No, uh, I will also echo that, uh, I think, uh, generally when, when, when you talk about foreign aid, now of course there are several types of aid, there is humanitarian aid, uh, assistance, relief, like, you know, those that, uh, uh, the rich, uh, countries send out to victims of earthquakes and flooding, I mean thats another thing, humanitarian aid.   And then theres military aid, and then there is official development assistance, ODA.  Uh, that is what, uh, technically is called development aid and I think this question is about that type of, uh, assistance.', 'Well, thank you very much, I think, you knowI certainly understand, um, how  you know, Americans are very generous people, and they certainly would like to help Africa.   But quite often, very often, they, they have been sort of encumbered by political correctness.  The unwillingness to criticizeuhbad polices in Africa for fear that if youre a white person and criticize a black African leader youll be labeled racist.   That has silenced a lot of people.  The nonsense in Africa must stop.  Bad leadership is one of our many problems in Africa.  And the foreign aid donors compound this problem.  Let me give you an example, in 1979 a Norwegian agenaid agency went to Kenya to help the Turkana tribespeople.   And the Norwegian agen agency decided, uh, the best way of helping the Takana tribespeople is to build them a fish-freezing plant.  After the plant was built at the cost of $25 [sic], all the media people were invited, even the', 'village brass band was invited.  And, but there was a small problem.  They discovered that the Turkana people dont fish. They raise goats.  Now, we have seen blunders upon blunders of such foreign aid programs in Africa.  Now we are asking you to vote for the motion, not because we want to cut up aidcut off aid, but, to send a strong message, that the system needs to be reformed, so that better aid, smart aid is sent to Africa.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Good evening.  I wanna talk to you about two tragedies that haveare covered by this debate.  The first tragedy weve already heard about, that theres a lot of unnecessary human suffering in Africa.  That for example, childrens lives could be saved for a 12- cent dose of anti-malaria medication, could save them from dying from malaria.   And that is inindeed a tragedy that children are dying for lack of a 12-cent medicine.  Everyone here on the panels agrees thats a tragedy and feels compassion at this enormous tragedy.   Theres also a second tragedy and thats this is a tragedy that we hear a lot less about.  And this is the tragedy that weve already spent as official donors $600 billion in aid to Africa over the past 45 years, and after all that children are still not getting the 12-cent medicines.   So there were still between one and three million deaths from malaria last year.  So aid would be a great thing if it worked.  But the sad tragedy is thatand this is really one of the, the scandals of our generation is that momoney meant for the most desperate people in the world, is simply not reaching them.   $600 billion in aid to Africa over the past 45 years, and over that tiover that time period theres basically been zero rise in living standards.  Zero rise in incomes in Africa.  The money is simply not reaching the people for whom it is intended.  And yet, the advocates of aid always focus their energies simply talking about this number, about how much we spend in aid, as if that in itself were an achievement of some kind.   This goes back, itevery generation calls for an increase in aid to try to resolve the problem of development.  It goes back to an advisor to John F. Kennedy named Walt Rostow World Bank president McNamara once again called for doubling of foreign aid.  Actually this is something that I noticed in my research which, uh, as a professor youre always kinda proud when you discover an empirical irregularity that really fits the data perfectly.   And that is that when people call for an increase in aid they always call for exactly double.  [LAUGHTER]  Its always exactly 100 percent increase.  Never, you know, 117 percent or 83itits amazing.   So this has continued to the present, the 2005 G-8 summit called for doubling aid to Africa. Barack Obamas called for doubling aid to Africa, Jeffrey Sachs has called for doubling aid to Africa.   Uh, even our President George W. Bush called for and has already implemented anan increase in US aid of 50 percent.  I did worry for a moment that that didnt fit my law, but, uh, I checked with the White House staff and they explained to me that he thought 50 percent was double.  [LAUGHTER]  So  [APPLAUSE]   So whatwhatwhat good does it do to focus on the amount spent, uh, this obsession with the amount spent on aid, if the balance of the evidence suggests that the, the money is not reaching the poor--sure, there is the occasional success, which we will hear about from time to time tonight, but the balance of the evidence is simply that, $600 billion went into Africa and income did not rise.  So where did the money go?  Well, unfortunately a lot of it went to corrupt rulers, to corrupt and autocratic rulers.  Today, despite all the talk of action against corruption, two-thirds of all aid today goes to rulers who have the worst rating on corruption. Two-thirds of aid going to corrupt rulers.  This is actually getting worse over time.   Theres no evidence of any sort of post-Cold War break, in which, you know, in the bad old days aid when to corrupt dictators and now it goes to good guys.  And by the way, uh, Gayle, Ethiopia is a good example, the, the ruler of Ethiopia is a guy named Meles who is a dictator who shot down unarmed demonstrators in the street, this is a guy who has been a darling of the aid community.   This is not the kind of aid that accomplishes good, this is the kind of aid that does more harm than  good.  And in fact, aid has gone into states that subsequently collapsed into warlord anarchy.   There was a lot of aid that went into Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, even up to the moment when the genocide broke out in Rwanda, there was still aid money going into Rwanda, in fact even after the genocide broke out the French were still supplying the Rwandan government, committing the genocide with aid dollars.  Some of it military aid, obscenely enough.   And so I say to you that aid, uh, and this is borne out by hisby statistical evidence, that aid worsens corruption, aid blocks democracy, aid is an obstacle to the freeing of Africans from predatory rulers   And I think we have no choice but to, to vote for the motion tonight, we, we cannot be satisfied with this record of aid, that has promised so much and accomplished so little.  We must condemn the sorry record of aid for the sake of Africa, and for ourselves.  Its simply unacceptable that a system which is supposed to have the best intentions, is simply making things worse rather than better. [APPLAUSE]', 'Uh, well, one sign of the rarity of success stories is that I keep hearing the same ones over and over again.  The, uh, the smallpox example is given, is given so often and itsit happened so long ago that, I think it should be consigned to, uh, to history at this point, uh   Im notI dontIm not going to say that everything fails, that there are no successes, smallsmallpox was a success, uh  But the fact that we keep citing the same thing over and over again suggests just how few successes there have been, the measles success,  unfortunately was, until this new announcement was actually on the ledger side of failure. Uh, the measlecheap and inexpensive measles vaccination had been available for decades, and yet had nothad not been used to save millions of lives from measles.  So Im not sure I would count that as much of a success at this point.', 'No, Im notIm not sure that were voting tonight on whether to stop aid, I think were voting on whether the existing aid system has done more harm than good, the, uh, the existing aid system I think were arguing is ineffective, itshas bad political effects in propping up corrupt autocrats.   And I think that system does more harm than good, uh, I, I could imagine other aid systems that would do some good, that could save lives.  If aid agencies were held accountable for results, which they are not now.  If they were held accountable for failure which they are not now. But we dont have that system at the present, were voting on the system we have now and thats the system that has failed us unfortunately.', 'And the UUS has no', 'strategic motives, at all now?', 'Two-thirds of official aid.', 'No, of course, its prolonging their lives, thats great, I salute that, uh, but, lets', 'Thats good.  [LAUGHS]  But lets, lets be clear about theselets be clear about these numbers, for many African countries, aid is 20 percent of their GDP.  If they had invested that', 'If they had invested that, then the ex expectation of the aid advocates was that they wouldve had economic growth.  And that simply is what did not happen.  It did it did not get invested, we did not have growth.', 'I can take the first one, and  So, what I was talking about was aid and economic growth.  The expectation', 'Yeah, OK, thank you.   Uh, what I was talking about is aid and economic growth.  The expectation of the aid advocates was that aid would be invested and would create economic growth, that is a steady rise in living standards of the poor population, and would gradually lead them to exit from poverty.  And that is what has not happened.  Uh, there has been aid but zero growth.  Now, John called this a spurious correlation.  Now, if any of you really do want to get tortured by economists I can try to give you some explanations of how economists deal with spurious correlations, but we have', 'We have methods for, for dealing with, uh, correlations.  We control for lots of other factors.  We deal with causality, which is causing which.  And at the end of the day the answer is pretty much the same, that aid does not generate economic growth. That was its promise, that, that promise it has failed to keep.', 'OK, well, um, this question is partly based on my experience at the World Bank where I spent part of my career, and uh, founded a not very effective bureaucracy to, uh, resolve the worlds problems.  Uh, I want to read a couple of quotes.  Uh, the first goes, \"the international system is ill equipped to provide aid because of a shortage of effective institutional arrangements, and above all resolve to translate commitments into action.\"  And the second quote is, \"our foreign aid system is broken.\"  So, it sounds like these quotes, uh, would, would be from this side of the table, but actually the first quote is from you, John, from the report Investing in Development, and the second quote is from you, Gayle, from your testimony to Congress.  So it seems like you kind of agree that our foreign aid system is broken and its not working.', 'Well, I wasnt the one who invented the objective of the end of poverty being the objective of aid, thats the title of Jeff Sachs book, uh, the boss of John McArthur.  Uh, thats the goal of the United Nations millennium development goals to end poverty. And what Im arguing, and all of us on this side are arguing is thats an unrealistic and unobtainable goal, that aid cannot achieve the end of poverty.  And in fact an aid system that is designed as it now to be mainly about ending poverty, cannot even be held accountable for anyone doing even these modest, tangible things, that all of us agree are good things to do. Because money does not unfortunately automatically translate into results.  The fact that you can say, for example, that, uh, a 10-cent oral rehydration therapy kit will save a babys life from dying from dehydration due to diarrhea.  That doesnt mean that the 10 cents willof course theres enough money there to pay for these 10-cent kits.  And yet still, two million babies died last year, from dehydration', 'for lack  of these 10-cent kits.  And what I cannot support is an aid system that aims at these utopian objecunobtainable objectives, of achieving the end of poverty, which is up to the Africans themselves, not to, uh, patronizing Western donors. And I would support a system that does focus on modest, tangible goals for thethat aid systhat aid agencies will be held accountable for, that they will be blamed, when someone is supposed to get oral rehydration kits, and doesnt get them and a baby dies.   That is an aid system that would work but that is not the aid system that we have now.  The aid system that we have now does more harm than good by propping up the corrupt autocrats, under the utopian objective that they are unthe illusion of creating development.  Which aid has failed to make any progress on throughout its history.']\n",
      "[\"Well, its always nice to have a logistics glitch, because it gives you a tiny bit more time to think about what you might say of any interest.  Um, let me start by saying something that isn't in the spirit of these debates, which is that I actually think theres quite a large middle ground on this question, and I'm, you know, I dont mind a good scrap, as any one of you who knows my work will know.  But I dont think that its simply a question of saying all aid is terrible or, or um, all aid is good, I think to the, you know, in the way that I want to invite you to vote for this, uh, resolution, its that on balance aid is, has done more harm, the resolution is well phrased, than good.  Its not that its a great, vast, you know, right wing conspiracy, or left wing conspiracy, I suppose, in the instance.  Um, its not that aid, some aid programs dont work, and have not been shown to work.  The problem, I think, and the reason that I, again, invite you to at least think hard about supporting this resolution, is that the whole discussion of AIDS avoids, makes a kind of moral and historical end run around the problem of politics.  It becomes, if you like, a kind of technical question.  There are these suffering people, as Mr. Rosenkranz and Mr. Lehrer both described to you. We do or we dont have the modalities to efficiently succor them. That is the aid narrative, if you will.  And that is a narrative that, largely speaking, deprives the recipients of aid of their agency, infantilizes them, and also make sour aid a super-political, extra- political, moral question.  It becomes a moral imperative, therefore we can't talk about the politics, we can't talk about whether the UN system actually works, which in my view, palpably, it doesnt.  Um, thats another, perhaps another debate, about which I would be more categorical.  Um, it is, it doesnt, but it most of all doesnt reckon with the fundamental question that people are not saved from outside, people rescue themselves, fundamentally.  They can be helped, theres nothing wrong with aid at the margins.  If aid were less ambitious, if aid has less of a kind of globalizing, dare I say it, totalitarian program, I would support it, as I support emergency relief, which at least in my understanding of emergency relief, is not long term development, but rapid entry and departure in major, usually war or refugee movement emergencies.  The words are unsatisfactory, but thats more or less what it is.  I dont, I, Ive worked in that field, and I do not think there is anything wrong with it.  On the contrary, I think if done properly, if it doesnt become a stalking horse for some ideological position, say liberal human rights, which I would insist is not simply the way the world is at its just, at its most just, but an ideological position.  That you, if it does what its meant to do, which is, as I wrote in a book on this subject, offer a bed for a night, but not hope to save people, to transform society, et cetera, then I think that, the value of that aid, assuming its honestly given, and competently given, is indisputable.  What is not indisputable by any stretch of the imagination is the idea that foreign institutions and governments and inter-governmental organizations, notably the European Union and the UN system know how to fix other peoples difficulties.  The problem with aid, in short, is that it sets itself up as the kind of know all and end all.  Now of course aid people will tell you this is no, not the case anymore, that was true in the bad old days of Lou Preston and the World Bank, it was true when all aid workers were, in Africa were, were white, it was true when, if you like, the aid system was kind of a direct follow on both of religious proselytizing, missionary impulse, and uh, colonialism. But the truth of the matter is that that old Texas adage, the man with the gold makes the rules, becomes, that definition of the golden rule, I mean, is as true today as it was when the French flag waved over [UNCLEAR].  And I dont think it can ever be different.  So that what you have with aid by definition is outsiders telling people in a place how to do it, and telling them if they dont behave satisfactorily, that is the best practices that you now see in humanitarianism, if you're not democratic, if you are not transparent, fi you dont do this, that, or the other thing, then we will withdraw the aid.  Well, if ever there was an example of any unequal form of relations, I would submit to you that thats it, which is why, precisely, in depriving people of their agency, aid does more harm than good.  It does some good, I, again, I insist on the point that there is middle ground here, but it does more harm than good.  Moreover, it does seem to me that the emphasis on aid is misplaced, and that if you want to talk about what can be done in a place like Africa, but not only in Africa, I mean, after all there are other parts of the world that are unfavored in this moment in history for many of the same reasons, you might talk about fair trade a lot more than talking about development aid.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]\", 'Well, what I think is impossible is the notion of aid as the centerpiece of development, uh, in Africa, thatsthatI mean my view, for what its worth, is simply that, the whole system of international development is structured around various modalities of aid.  Thats why I brought up the trade issue which I insist is a real issue despite what Mr. McArthur said, because the terms of trade are stacked against Africa.   To use only one example, theyre not only stacked against Africa, theyre stacked against other parts of the world as well.  But, you know, to put it, you know, very bluntly that, you know, that, this is athe system of trade at the moment, is in an age of rising commodity prices, nonetheless, uh,  structured so that the actual producers of commodities get screwed by the, by the system, the international system of trade.  So, my view is simply that, by making development aid from the outside, whether its national governments, or inter-governmental institutions, the centerpiece of what youre doing means its always going to fail.   And I think that were the thing that troubles me about the, if you like, the, thethose arguing against this motion is falseI, I, I mean obviously, somebody who grew upI grew up in the 60s, and I remember leftists of my type, uh, saying at the time, well, of course the Soviet Unions no good and Cubas no good and Chinas no good and Koreas no good and Albanias obviously no good.   But thats actually existing Communism.  What there is, theres this wonderful Communism that we could somehow create.  And I think the lesson, this is a point made by the critic of development, Colin Leys, in his famous book, that at a certain point you have to say, you had to say, even if you remainif you were on the left, and I remain on the left, uh, I wanna be clear about that, uh  [LAUGHTER]  In this call above all others.   Um, but, uhbut the, at a certain point, people on the left had to admit that this was a lie.  That there was not actually existing Communism and ideal Communism, thewhat actually existed was Communism.  Period.  Thats', 'Well, the disagreement is, if youre saying that  My emphasis on trade, John, is not the Doha Round, I mean if, if youre, ifwe agree about the Doha Round.', \"Yeah, Id like, I think, I hope I'm right that it was John, that you said this, that, that youre here to debate the present, not the past of aid.  And I worry, just as a historical reading, and would ask you at least to consider the possibility that the argument you're making is the argument that the justifiers of aid have made pretty much every ten years since basically the fifties, since the, the era of de-colonization.  And I, I mean, this is actually not a polemical question, Id like to know why you think this time its not simply a, as George says, a question of interest, but that one can actually legitimately say that the present of aid is, is different from all experience past?\", 'Yeah.  Um, let me do it, if I may', 'The, umI, I, I think the Marshall Plan is precisely interesting because it, itcomes back to the point that George Ayittey keeps making and, and I think is the essential point which is the point of the state.  The problem with the Marshall Plan, John, is not that it was $85 to a small number of states rather than $30.  It was that there were functioning states there to administer it. The Marshall Plan would have had no hope whatsoever, of working historically, had the Allied powers in the aftermath of World War II not reestablished the German statefor one thing, it was the first thing they did when they arrived.   So you cannot get around this question, that as I say George Ayittey keeps raising, which is, your are talking  And it gets very fluid here, the answer was, well, societies, countries  Well, what do we mean.  Whats gonna happen, youre gonna shoot your way in if you dont like the state?   Uh, I mean societies, countries, we talk all thisI mean civil society is a descriptive term that keeps being min misused in the, in the NGO world as a, as asorry, descriptive term, misused as a prescriptive term all the time.   Its not as if civil society can stand up to the power of the state like that.  So that, you know, these, these models seem to me to avoidthe problem, because precisely people dont wanna talk about politics, precisely because I think,  with all due respect, the mistake that both particularly US NGOs and the UN system make, over and over again, is the idea that as I believe one, either Gayle or John put it, you can ring-fence it from politics.  You cant.', 'There were 18-year-old women in Stalins Russia', 'who had the same ambition', 'I dont see the point of that really.', \"Iit used to be said in the '90s when George Soros had more money, that he did what the United States didnt have the money to do.

The idea that somehow you can say, well, governments, thats not good but somehow Gates or Soros  The truth is, this is one system, and again, its a system that doesnt work.\", 'Well, II think the first thing you have to do is distinguish between aid and help.  The reason that this side of thetable has kept arguing and insisting that aid does more harm than good is not because were against help, but because aid is a system, and that system is corrupt, inefficient, and wrongheaded, in the main. That you can have a zillion anecdotes, that anyone would rather have, as I put it about humanitarianism, a bed for the night than no bed for the night, doesnt make it a good system.   And the thing is, yes.  If aif the only relief you get is someone bringing you a bed net, or some fertilizer, obviousand the choice is formulated as, would you prefer a bed net, or would you prefer nothing, well, then sure, then you get a, you get a nice kind of Enver Hoxha [PH] style majority for aid.  But those arent the choices.', 'The choices aretalking about things that would haveif implemented, fair trade being in my view the most important, would have infinitely more positive effects, and that in effect by concentrating on aid, were ignoring in fact, the things that actually would make peoples lives better, that they would say, Ill still take aid if my choices are aid and nothing.

      "['I think that when we discuss, um, racial preferences and I am gonna largely restrict what Im saying to racial preferences in universities although many of these things also apply to affirmative action as handled elsewherewe often are under the impression that what were talking about is something as simple as a tie-breaking process, a thumb on the scale,  the idea being that, if qualifications are equal or more less equal between a black and a white candidate, that, one gives the nod to the black person.  I personally would find nothing problematic with that policy, I dont think most people would.   And to the extent that it is generally implied, generally via omission, that thats what were talking about when we talk about racial preferences and that were not talking about qualifications or test scores, or things that we dont wanna talk about   then its understandable that there reigns a sense that, to be opposed to these racial preference policies means that a person must be nave or unfeeling or have a sinister agenda or something like that, all of that is, is perfectly, perfectly understandable.   And then certain words are used, inequality, resegregation, white privilege, societal racism, et cetera, and all of those concepts are important, there is a great deal of injustice in the country now and there always has been and we should think about it.   But, those words also have a kind of rhetorical power that I think distracts us from the actual logic of the case here, and what racial justice is, that is how we actually solve the problems that I think were all concerned with. Andfrom what Ive seen over my years in discussing this question, there are certain basic facts about how racial preferences are played out, that were not often told, I dont think that people who think differently than me are willfully ignoring these things, I think these things just dont get out there very much but they are absolutely crucial, to evaluating this particular case, and in my remaining seven minutes and about 13 seconds I just wanna give you a few of those things, for one thing, affirmative action, racial preferences as were talking about, is not just a tie-breaker.  If thats really all this debate has been about, I never wouldve joined it.  There are all sorts of things.  In 1991, in terms of all of the students who were admitted to selective law schools, um, there were 420 black ones, 24 were admitted according to what the qualifications were considered to be appropriate for, for white and Asian students, all the rest of them just based on the numbers wouldnt have gotten in.   I respect what Tim Wise has said, we have very different data in terms of the qualifications, if it were true the qualifications were the same, this would be a rather vacuous and petty debate. But the fact is, that according to anything that I know, theyre not.   For example, one argument that we might hear before we leave tonight is that SATs are meaningless.  Now there are dueling studies on that, Im not sure exactly where one is to stand as a good-thinking person at this point.   But certainly, it bears mentioning, that if you looked at UC Berkeley undergraduates who were black and their graduation rates after 1988, they actually tracked in virtual lock-step with SAT scores. The lower the score, the more likely the person was to graduate, that suggests to me something that I think all of us know deep down, which is that, no matter how you jigger the statistics, SAT scores do mean something, not everything, of course, but they do mean something.   Or, for example, Richard Sandor has shown that, umwith, um, black students admitted to 163 law schools, that, because so very many of them were admitted not according to the qualifications that they submitted but out of a sense of a commitment to diversity and lowering standards,  that over half of them were in the bottom 10 percent of their class and that wasnt only in they first year, and that there was a truly alarming rate of failing the bar exam.  Now, these are all difficult issues but things like this, and needless to say, I could go on for a very long time but Ive only got eight minutesthey have to be brought into a debate like this, they cannot be ignored, they cannot be trivialized.  These things are real.   Also, to eliminate racial preferences at selective universities does not deny black people an education.  At UC San Diego before the ban on racial preferences out in California, exactly one out of 3,268 freshmen who were black, were making honors.   After the ban, 20 percent of black students were making honors, because the students who would have been admitted to Berkeley or UCLA were now admitted to UC-San Diego.  I think that was a good thing.  It certainly wasnt a bad thing.  And its something that needs to be talked about.   Lets talk a little bit about diversity, because I think thats gonna come up.  For one thing, I remember being in college, and this is purely anecdotal, but, the idea of someone calling on me in class to talk about, you know, my take on the black experience or what the black perspective on things was, was something that made me sweat bullets and Ive heard this from countless black undergraduates,  many of whom tell me when Im doing a book tour that to them, thats evidence that theres racism at universities, that theyre expected to be diverse representatives.  So we can talk about diversity, but, how does it actually feel to be a diverse person.   More to the point.  Its often said that diversity has been proven to make for a better-quality education.  Has it?  How.  Like if youve ever actually looked into that, the people who try to prove it with studies, and none of them are conservatives, find again and again, that, as I think we all knew, diversity does not really have anything to do with giving you a more beneficial experience in terms of how much knowledge you have in your head or how much moral wisdom you have in your head, after you come from college.  There was a poll of University of Michigan minority, um, law-school grads from 1970 to 1996.  To them, being called on as a diverse person in class was at the very bottom of what they valued most about their experience as was the diversity.  What they most valued in their experience was how smart teachers and their fellow students were, remember this is minority students.  Or, Mitchell J. Chang showed that in terms of diversity in your undergraduate experience, it did mean that you talked about race more on campus, but it didnt mean that you had more friends of another race and it didnt improve your GPA and it didnt improve how you feel about going to college.   Stephen Cole and Elinor Barber have shown that when black students are placed in schools where they actually would have been more appropriately placed in terms of qualifications and qualifications do matter, into schools like these,  then, what happened is that they made lower grades which discouraged them from going to get Ph.D.s.  This was a study done by good liberal people, they did not expect it. But that means that we have fewer black academics because of these policies.  Now based on the things that Ive mentioned, and clear', 'clearly they belong at the table.  I do wanna say one thing.  The idea that all of these sorts of things that Ive discussed, and the fact that there are other ways of addressing this problem, are there, and theyre worth talking about.   The notion that anybody would say, that, a legacy student is something that black students should be proud to compare themselves to, or, that a legacy student is something that is okay, I II dont get it, I met legacy students when I was in school, it was not a pretty picture.   I certainly do not agree with these legacy policies, however, because Im black, Im talking about this kind of policy as it is applied to people of my race because I think that it hurts them.  Im not gonna make some hoary argument about the Constitution, or something like that.   I dont think that it helps black students to be the best that they can be.  And I think Ill stop there.  But there are issues in this debate that we simply dont hear about.  Its not as simple as just being against resegregation', 'and calling for diversity, thank you', 'Booker T. Washington', \"knew a very different world than ours, and I personally would not be in favor of his particular view that people really should just pick themselves up, and thats all.  Really, people do need help.  He never knew the New Deal, he never knew the Great Society, he never knew Affirmative Action when it was first instituted, which I personally think was a very important thing given the situation in the country at the time.  However, his basic insight that there does come a point when, in order to cope with an imperfect world, you have to do it yourself.  There comes a point, is one that I think is valuable.  One reads his writings now, and they're not nearly as reactionary and foreign as one would think.  I think its an advance in our society that we do have a safety net, that we do have things to, for example, help the poor. For me, socio-economic preference makes perfect sense.  The issue, simply, is that today there is not nearly as large an overlap between disadvantage and having black skin as there was in 1960 or even 1970\", 'Its time for a revision.', 'It was about fifteen years ago', 'Well, thats', 'Robert?', 'Could I?', \"I think that one thing that we are leaving out of the discussion, and you have to bring it in, is that much of the reason that, uh, middle class black kids have trouble with submitting the same kind of file as a white kid would have, is a tendency among black teens to say that it is white to do well in school.  Theres a myth nowadays, there is a myth nowadays that that has been disproven.  And Id like to try to be as pacific as possible here, pacific is the word I'm using, but here I can't, thats a myth. There are many studies, Ive looked at all of them in detail, all of them show, even when they dont think they're showing it, that there is a strong tendency for black kids to tease each other that way. There are reasons for it.  But, the question is, how does, how do racial preference programs address that particular problem, which I think is addressable, and is being addressed by things that go on before kids go to college? We can't just leave that out of the discussion because the data is inconvenient, and I think its absolutely crucial to the things that were talking about.\", \"Sir, when The Bell Curve came out, I was very young, I had no public presence, I was studying linguistics, and so I dont know what I would have said.  To the extent that Bradley funded that book, which I frankly did not know, and that they fund some work that the Manhattan Institute does, thats certainly true. Charles Murray has nothing to do with the Manhattan Institute, and stopped, as a matter of fact, while he was writing that book. And what I'm funded for doing at the Manhattan Institute is things like working on prisoner re-entry programs, et cetera.  But whats important is that when I talk about the acting white phenomenon, I'm not saying that its a pathology, I'm not blaming the black kids for this, this is something that happened as the result of a sequence of socio-historical things that ultimately have their root in racism.  Nevertheless, it is there today, and I dont think that it can be denied.  And the issue is to treat it, and to show black kids that there are different ways to think along those lines.\", 'Robert, can I interject something quickly', 'Just real quick.', \"I think we have to be very careful with the words integration and segregation, as they happen to have drifted into certain implications in our time.  Because often the way were using the word segregation today implies something I'm very uncomfortable with, which is that the only way that black people can really excel is if white people are around, and I'm not comfortable with that. And so we talk about schools, and for me, a dominant image is, for example, Kip Academies, where all the kids are black or brown and poor, and they're being taught very well by dedicated teachers, and there are new Kip Academies every year.  And somehow, on the other hand, especially in academia, it seems that were supposed to keep talking about increasing segregation, as if segregation now is always the same thing as it was forty years ago, when actually a whole lot of black kids, poor black kids in a room together can learn very well.  That excites me.  It is peculiar to me how unexciting that seems to be found by a lot of\", 'That, thank you, that was it, that was it.', 'Thats a distortion', 'Thats a distortion', 'I dont think that thats what I said', \"I think that when were evaluating this debate, a crucial thing to realize is that there is no denial on any of our part that there is inequality in our society.  This is the crucial point: looking at the nation that were in, looking at the history of the world, looking at the nature of our species, it is logically unclear to me that there ever could be a human society where the playing field is completely level.  Now, we can work on things, but its always going to be imperfect, and its going to be imperfect enough to matter.  You can be committed to social justice while realizing that because society cannot be perfect, what our job is, is to teach people who didn't come out with as many chips as we would have liked, to cope and do the best that they can despite the imperfections of the system. Now, somebody is down on the bottom, of course, I personally am in favor of there being help, of there being relaxations of standards, if necessary.  But when this is simply a matter of skin color\", \"I think that we have departed from what the original intentions of these policies were. The issue is not waiting for there to be no inequality or discrimination, the idea is, when do you let it go, because theres never going to be a society thats completely without it.  And in closing I would like to say that there is evidence pro and con for this, and I don't see on the other side any engagement with the con.  There is an understandable sense that their arguments are Gods arguments, the only ones worth mattering, and that anybody who has different ideas is funded by sinister people, or has a different agenda, et cetera., et cetera. [LAUGHTER]  Its not true.  To be honest, Ive studied their stuff. I know the pro.  There are other arguments written by cogent people, many of them not conservatives, these people dont see those arguments as worthy of engagement.  Their case, therefore, is incomplete.  I think you should vote for us.  [APPLAUSE]\"]\n",
      "['Uh, thank you.  Uh, look, for the last 40 years Americas been engaged in a massive social experiment, to see whether the use of racial preferences could bring about the full integration of American socisociety.  The question tonight is whether these preferential policies can deliver on that promise.  And the question need not be abstract nor need it divide liberals and conservatives.  Thats because in the last decade, a growing body of data has become available, that helps us get a handle on the trade-off between attending an elite institution, on the basis of different admissions standards, or attending a less prestigious institution.   Lets start with the effect of racial preferences, uh, in undergraduate colleges.  Im going to focus on one specific academic area, namely science.  Not many minority students enter science, and many who do drop out along the way.   Blacks receive about 5.3 percent of the bachelors degrees in science, despite making up about 9 percent of the college enrollment. Well research into these disparities by Dartmouth psychologist Rogers Elliot, provides a template of the kinds of questions we should be asking not just in the area of science, but in every area, where preferential policies are employed.   Because it turns out that the preferences themselves, are part of the problem.  The first thing that Elliots data does, is dispel the assumption that non-Asian minority students somehow arent interested in science.   In fact, high-achieving black and Hispanic high school seniors, are more interested in majoring in science, than whites. The second thing the data tells us is that the really elite research universities, the schools that recruit the most promising students, black and white, use significant racial preferences to enroll the most gifted and talented black andblack and study, fowhich focused on four Ivy League schools, found that the mean SAT math score for black students was 100 points below that of white students.  That difference was about 1.6 times thissorry, 1.6 standard deviations of the white scores. This means that the black mean was not only below the white mean, it was so far below the white mean that the majority of black students had scores in the bottom 10 percent of the distribution of scores of all students.   Now right away this significant use of race preferences by the most elite schools is significant.  The fact that the very top schools, that have their pick of the best students, are using preferences of this magnitude, suggests that the next tier of schools are likely using greater preferences, and in fact, second-tier schools do use greater preferences, about 15 percent larger than those used by the top schools.   As a consequence, many black and Hispanic students up and down the line are attending schools where their credentials are significantly out of line with those of their, uh, classmates.  Well one possible response at this point, and we may hear this later on tonight, is to say that the SAT math score doesnt fairly measure black academic success.   One could even deny that admitting black students with lower SAT math scores amounts to a preference.  Well, we could debate this all night, but the research on this point is undisputed.  If anything grades and SAT scores over-predict black performance.   So admitting blacks and Hispanics with significantly lower test scores and grades make it all but certain that blacks and Hispanics as a group, will get lower grades asin college, and thats just what Elliot found.  Blacks interested in science at these schools had grades almost a full GPA lower than whites.   For many students, many minority students this made it difficult to continue in science, and Elliot found that only a third of the blacks who started in science, at elite schools, uh, completed a degree in science.  The rest switched majors, or dropped out altogether. Uh, and this rate was twice the rate of white students at those schools.  Second, uh, the lower grades of those who did finish disadvantaged them significantly both in going on to graduate school, and getting jobs.   Well, if the story ended here you might think that test-score gaps make it highly unlikely that blacks will ever, or a significant number of blacks will ever succeed in science.  Uh, this would be a very dreary conclusion if it were true but the fact is, its not true.   This is where the data tells us something very interesting, it helps us get a handle on the real problem with preferential policies, because it turns out that the absolute value of a students math SAT score and high school grades, is less important, as the relative difference between ones credentials, and those of his or her classmates.   How do we know this.  Well, it turns out that black students interested in science, who attend schools where their math SAT scores more closely match that of other students, persist in science at much higher rates, even though the average SAT scores at these schools is lower.   So for example, Howard University, a historically black college, has average SAT math scores of about 450, well below the mean of the, at the, the, uh, SAT score, at the elite schools weve been discussing, yet Howard is the top producer of black undergraduate science and engineering degrees in the country.   Whats more, a large percentage of undergraduate science majors at Howard and other historically black colleges, go on to get Ph.D.s in science.  Of the top 21 undergraduate producers of black Ph.D.s in the country, 17 of them, 17 of the 21, are historically black colleges, and none are among the 30 or so most selective schools that routinely recruit the most talented black high school students.  And so what we have is this perverse system.  The institutions with the poorest track records for producing black Ph.D.s in science, are getting the best minority students, and then, driving them out of science at twice the rate of white students.   And the institutions with the best track record, are getting the middling students, and then, producing the overwhelming majority of black Ph.D.s in science. Well what lessons can we draw from this.  First, the existence of racial inequalities in society which nobody on this side of the table denies, is not a sufficient justification for preferential policies.   Its bad enough that African-Americans are so substantially underrepresented in science.  Its completely inexcusable that racial preferences end up frustrating and discouraging the gifted black high school seniors who say they want to study science.   Second, it is misleading to evaluate racial preferences in the abstract, as if were talking about one', 'or two institutions that use preferences in a handful of deserving cases.  What were dealing with, the problem that weve got, is the systematic use of racial preferences by every single institution of higher education in the country.   Ive used my time to focus on one specific problem in some detail, but a growing body of research shows similar effects in many other areas. Surely all of us can agree, that schools should be required to publish graduation rates and grade distributions, and yes, persistence in majors, broken down according to the different preferences granted,  and that means all of them, including racial preferences, alumni preferences and athletic preferences, the problem is the same in all cases.  But more fundamentally, we need to ask ourselves why we tolerate the systematic use of race preferences.   Every Supreme Court precedent in this areas held that racial preferences are a last resort.  Yet schools continue to treat preferences', 'as a sacred cow', 'they must defend to the death.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Uh, clearly, uh, institutions that operated in completely segregated systems had to do something more than, uh, remove the, uh, fact of segregation itself, they had to take affirmative steps to break down the barriers that they themselves had created.   That was the original idea of affirmative action and it made sense then.  But since then its grown into, uh, the systematic use of preferences all over the place and thats just a completely', 'differentuse', 'No, Im talking about particular institutions, for example', 'Yes', 'To remedy their own discrimination', 'Thats what I think, thats right', 'Well', 'Yes, well, the simple answer is thats not our position and it never has been our position, we routinely rely on these civil rights laws, like Section 1981, and Title 6 in our lawsuits.  Those laws are primarily directed towards discrimination by private entities, uh, and private individuals, so,  uh, our organization, uh, not only, uh, is not attacking those laws, were using those laws and we fully support the use of those laws and the various investigative agencies to go after, uh, identifiable acts of discrimination', 'by individuals and private entities, so, the premise of your question, uh, is false.', 'Uh, itsthats false.', 'UhKimberl, if it turned out, if the evidence developed and, uh, that, uh, race preferences or preferential policies, uh, turn out to pose barriers, uh, to minority success, similar to the barriers you identified in your talk, uh, would you reconsider your support for them.', 'I mean, I, look, I agree.', \"I think that, uh, theres real value to integrated education, theres value to diversity, but thats really not what this debate is about. This debate is about ones means used to achieve integration, one means used to achieve diversity.  And the way its been used to achieve diversity is highly mechanical, and imposes a lot of costs on, uh, African-American students in particular.  And what were saying is, youve got to look at those costs, you can't just sweep them off the table with this, you know, with rhetoric about the value of diversity.  We all agree diversity is important.  What we disagree about is the means used to achieve the, that diversity\", \"I, I'm  Go ahead.\", \"Well, tonight all of us are gathered here to defend the principle of equality, and I think we do that with a sense that equality is under siege as never before, and thats because real equality is never achieved, its always coming into existence.  As our opponents say, theres a lot of work to be done, and thats true. But today, the challenge to equality doesnt come from the political extremes, it comes from really the political middle. Moderates have tried to eliminate differences in achievement among black and white eighteen year olds by essentially engineering an admissions system that makes them go away, and with characteristic efficiency those preferences have been extended to every institution after, uh, undergraduate college, including professional schools and public and private employment.  Though they aren't intended to do so, these policies perpetuate racial differences, and they corrode social bonds. They make it difficult for minority high school students to attend schools where their credentials would make them academically competitive.\", 'And thats the point about the, uh, historically black colleges. Its not that blacks ought to go to the HBCUs, its that the white schools, the elite schools ought to learn from the way the HBCUs run their admissions programs, they admit on the basis of merit, and it makes a big difference.  The most troubling aspect about tonights debate has been the reaction of our opponents to efforts to disclose the problems and end these policies.  Our opponents essentially demand that we continue to wink at real differences in qualification, and demand also that we remain discreetly silent about the predictable consequences of this winking.  Its time to put an end to race preferences, it may have been a good idea at one point, but it no longer serves a useful purpose.  There are too many other important issues that we need to be talking about if were going to achieve real equality in our lifetime.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Thanks.  Hoo, boy.  [LAUGHS]  Feel like I did before my first love scene with Halle Berry, so, you can  [LAUGHTER]  imagine, if you have any imagination at all the butterflies, and actually the excitement.  Uh, because Im here in defense of what I think is one of the, uh, cornerstones of our republic, that of non- discrimination.   And I think it was articulated in Brown vs. the Board of Education when, decided that discrimination in our public schools was unconstitutional, became part of our cultural lexicon a few years later when Presidents Kennedy and Johnson issued an executive order, that stately clearly and unambiguously, that, affirmative action should be taken to ensure that hiring, uh, decisions were made without regard to race.   And then of course it was given teeth in the law, uh, through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was very clear, that, uh, discrimination based on race was unlawful.  And, uh, to quote, uhan 80s sitcom, uh, its a different world from where ya come from.   That was then, that was good old-fashioned non- discrimination, and it was good for America.  Well times have changed, and what were talking about now, affirmative action is no longer about non-discrimination, its about racial preferences. And that is what we opposeracial preferences.   Now, that doesnt mean that we believe that racism has suddenly disappeared.  It hasnt.  We know that racism exists.  Listen.  Im 45 years old.  Ive been black in America for a long time.  I have seen racism, I have been the victim of racism, Im not about to stand up here and pretend, that it doesnt exist.  But the question before us is not, does racism exist, the question is, are racial preferences an effective means to combat racism.   And the answer is simply no.  There isnt any evidence at all, that racial preferences actually benefits us in terms of our race relations, in fact, what evidence there is points to just the opposite.  What we do know, is that racial preferences tend to, to enenhance, and, and firm up negative stereotypes, particularly as it pertains to black intellectual capacity and academic capabilities.  Um You knowthere was a saying that my mother had.  And I hear it in my head right now.  There is no monopoly on brain power.  Thats what my mother said all the time, there is no monopoly on brain power, black people can compete, we can compete on the athletic field, we can compete in the symphony halls, and we can compete in the classrooms.   And whats more, my mother said, you can compete, and you will compete.  But there are some folks who, sadly, are gonna tell my children something very different. And you dont have to take my word for it, lets just look at what they say.   Richard Atkinson, former president of the University of California at Berkeley, standing before an audience similar to this, at University of San Diego, said that it was highly doubtful if not impossible that we would achieve diversity on our nations premiere campuses without the use of racial preferences.   Now Atkinson was not standing before a curious world, telling everybody hes just a big fat racist, and unless you rein me in Im gonna start discriminating right and left!  No.  What he was saying is that there is a monopoly on brain power, and that black students dont have it in sufficient quantity to show up in significant numbers in our nations campuses.   Now if youre not sufficientlyoffended, as you should be, lets take something else that you often hear in discussions like this.  Someone, maybe here or over here, is bound to stand up and say whoa!  I benefited from affirmative action.  You benefited from affirmative action, she benefited from affirmative action.   And of course, theyre not saying, well, you benefited from non-discrimination. Well I did and thats a good thing.  What theyre saying is, I couldnt qualify, you couldnt qualify, she couldnt qualify Absurd.   Miss Krimberle [sic]Kimberl Crenshaw there.  Ive met her for the first time, Ive read what shes written, Ive heard her on the radio, this is a smart, dynamic woman.  The idea, that but for racial preferences, Miss Crenshaw would be standing on the corner singing doo wop someplace is offensive to me, and it should be offensive to all in the sound of my voice.   Now, youre gonna hear a lotta statistics today, Im not gonna talk to you about statistics.  Im gonna talk to you about people, because racial preferences impact and affect people.  This past April, spring, my wife was at a birthday party with our, with our children.  Andthe mothers are sitting there talking, the fathers in there, you know, that, you tend to avoid these things like the plague so I wasnt there.   Uhbut the mothers are grouped and theyre talking about their children, where they go to school and it comes to light, that my oldest boy attends a magnet program, uh, for highly gifted students.   Without missing a beatone of the other mothers says, well, you know, now, with this Supreme Court decision they wont be able to accept, uh, kids in these programs for diversity.  [PAUSE]  Well, my wife was kinder than I would have been.   After she picked her jaw up off the floor she explained to the woman, look.  Hes not in this program because he checked some box.  You cant get in this program unless you score 99.9 percent on the test.  Let me repeat that99.9 percent on the test.   And, hes making straight As.  In this program. And what is more ironic, is that the woman she was talking to, is a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District.  Thatis the evil of racial preferences.   That, is the real-life impact of racial preferences.  Teachers, who lack faith in the academic abilities of their students, and children, who no matter how hard they work, no matter howhow broad their gifts  are stained with preference.  With, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, benefifishifishishence. [LAUGHTER]  Thats Greek.  [LAUGHTER]', 'And my child is not the only one, there are thousands, and thousands of students just like him, who cannot enter our nations college campuses boldly and confidently.  They enter, again, dripping with the stigma of racial preferences.  And Im here to tell you tonight, that that is not good for America.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'No, I would answer him, uh, with the words of Colin Powell.  Who in talking about affirmative action, talked about color-blindness. Uh, and, and, um, I cant remember the exact quote but what Colin Powell says, is that if youre talking about, umremoving barriers, if youre talking about non-discriminationso that, uh, then, then hes all for it, Im all for it, everyone here is for it.   If youre talking about putting people, uh, in places of, of, uhover, over the, uhnot the ruling of men, but, you knowoffice, officers over groups of men, who, uh, are not qualified, that is not what Colin Powell endorses and Im positive, that that is not what, uh, Norman Schwarzkopf', 'No, of course not, I think that that, uh, that that clearly undermines the confidence that you need to have, uh, in a fighting unit.', 'Uhooh.', 'Okay.  Make the actor go first.  [LAUGHTER]  Gonna be protesting outside of here.  Um, I have two questions', 'Im trying to choose', 'which one, well, Ill ask this one.  Id like to know, uh, I, I listened to Tims speech, and, umI, I, I  I thought, umand wanted to know why is it that, uh, that blacks, or that you seem to think that blacks can only achieve, when the playing field is level.', 'Its my position, that, uhaffirmative action, in the form of racial non-discrimination, is a good thing, its good for America, thats what Colin Powell says.  Racial preferences, uh, are not a good thing, and I dont believe that thats what Colin Powell says', 'No, thatsI said in my', 'Youre asking me to go back', 'Im gobut  You know, you, you take one speech that someone made and they may have said other things at, at other times during other, uh, conversations.  So I dont know what he said during that, uh, particular speech', 'And I think that I, Iuh, accurately reflected his sentiments', 'I think I accurately', 'Now wait a minute', 'I havent heard from you exactly what he said', 'Ive heard you tell me that I was wrong, I didnt hear the quote. AUDIENCE MEMBER Read the book.', 'I did the read', 'Do you have the quote?  Or are you just yelling out from the audience', 'In other words you dont have the quote', 'youre just free to say Im wrong', 'without having', 'Disadvantage', \"Range of disadvantage, disadvantages, uh, do not come with a black face.  Uh, and this is why earlier I said, we need to talk about people, because when we start talking in these broad terms, were talking about the black middle class, I happen to live in Los Angeles, down the street from Calabasas [PH], California, which is one of the wealthiest communities in America.  I coach football, and I have black kids on my team with parents who make more money than most, half of everybody in here added up together.  THE idea that, that these children are in need of preferences because they dont have access, uh ,to, to the same, uh, benefits that their white counterparts, is just ridiculous. Because were not talking about individuals suddenly, were talking about people, um, generally, in term of their race.  I also want to go back to, to address something else that was said, this idea of, of this testing.  Look, right now, these are the tests that were using, and I want you to listen very closely, what were talking about, oh, the tests, uh, not the preparation, and on and on and this  The underlying message is that our kids can't compete, that my three sons cannot compete.  And I dont buy it.\", 'If we want to get rid of these tests, then lets get rid of them. Whatever standard we use, the standard should be applied equally to all kids', \"That's what were saying here.\", \"I was going to say, I'm glad you put that up, because I'm not convinced that diversity is all that important, uh, diversity in terms of skin color.  I think that when we go to school, the people that we befriend, the people in our neighborhoods that, uh, that we hang out with, are people that we share values with.  When you talk to college students, and people have been to college, and what was most important about their college experience, it had to do not with the color of the person sitting next to them, but the values of, of the teachers, and those kinds of things.  [APPLAUSE] Um, of course, I, you know, integration is a great thing.  Uh, I'm for that.  I'm for it when people want to do it.  Um, am I, am I for people manipulating and forcing people?  I dont think that thats a good thing, I dont think that thats, uh, I dont think that thats good for America at all. And I also want to make this point: uh, we talk about how great diversity is, and yet, the schools, who great diversity is for the educational benefits for our students, and yet the schools that are routinely churning out the greatest number of black doctors, the greatest number of black lawyers, are HBCUs, which are not racially integrated at all: Morehouse, Spellman, Howard, et cetera.  Ninety-eight, ninety-nine percent black.  That is not, in my opinion, a bad thing.  And if it is, then Tim, maybe we should make sure that we get a critical mass of white girls down at Spellman, and uh, be, be on our way\", \"If white folks are so racist, if they come out of the womb hating black folks, why on earth would we trust them to run Affirmative Action programs designed to bolster the education of black students?  That's what I heard him say.  So what kind of society do we want?  I have a little more faith in the American people than I think some folks on the other side do, because I think that the American people, theyve spoken loudly in California, theyve spoken loudly in Michigan and Washington, they will speak loudly in Arizona, and Colorado, and other states in the upcoming election, that they are in favor of integrated societies.\", \"The American people are in favor of equal opportunity.  What they want is fairness.  I think its quite a compliment that more and more people are saying, listen, they're, they're taking the words of my mother, and they're saying, listen, there is no monopoly on brain power.  Black folks can compete, we want to give them the opportunity, and I think its about time. [APPLAUSE]\"]\n",

      "['Thank you and good evening, um  [PAUSE]  For the radio audience Ive just placed a teapot and a teacup on the lectern. Its a pleasure to be here this evening, thank you to our host, the Rosenkranz Foundation, to NPR.  Thank you also, tothank all of you for coming and thank you to the opposing team, for what I know will be a well-articulated argument for something we all wish were true.   Unfortunately it is not.  I am here to argue for the motion that Russia is becoming our enemy again.  Id like to begin with a few definitions.  Russia is an enormous polity encompassing more than 140 million people, 11 time zones and a multitude of views.   Im sure that many people in this room are personally acquainted with Russians who are by no means our enemies.  Uh, but inside Russia, their views count for less and less.  And in speaking of Russia, we must speak increasof the increasingly authoritarian state  In speaking of Russia in this debate tonight, the increasingly authoritarian Russian state of President Putin, of the security apparatus, and the chief and increasingly centralized and authoritarian centers of power.  Um, another definition Id like to just get into quickly thats important is enemy.  The American Heritage Dictionary, which seems appropriate tonight, defines enemy as, quote, one who manifests malice or hostility toward or opposes the purposes or interestsinterests of another.  A foe; an opponent.   Finally, no one is here tonight that Ruto argue that Russia is right now our enemy.  The motion up for debate is that Russia is becoming our enemy again.  It is that direction, that becoming, that trajectory, which we are here to debate.  For two benchmarks, I would like to share with a memory of a dinner in Moscow more than a decade ago.  It was with someone who has experienced, then and since, firsthand, Russias trajectory not at a distance but has been living it.  Uh, he was then optimistic, it was a dinner with a number of journalists and despite our worries, he assured us that all would be well, that Russia was heading in a good direction, that Russians could get rich doing honest business. His name was Garry Kasparov.  Today, Mr. Kasparov has been pouring forth articles and giving interviews in the West warning us that Russia is becoming, indeed has become, a criminal petro- state.   The model he tells us is not the old czarist autocracy, but The Godfather, the Mafia.  He wants to run in the Presidential election next March, but what he recently told MSNBC is that were notquote, Were not fighting to win elections, were fighting to have elections.   Okay, that may be bad for Russia, but does it mean that Russias government is becoming Americas enemy.  Yes.  We live in an age when governments tend to export their creeds, methods, and technologiesuh, and techniques, excuse me.   And, um, Id like to just invite you for a minute to imagine, engage in a little imaginary experiment, that you are a Russian democrat, a patriot, trying to warn the free world that Russia is becoming an increasingly dangerous police state.   Lets say youre investigating the murder of a journalist and you meet in a city, say London, with an emissary of the Kremlin.  You have every right to the question you wish to ask, tea is served.  Would you without a second thought these days, drink that tea? [LAUGHTER]   This is a picture of Alexander Litvinenko who drank it, hes here on this deathbed, these are the effects of Polonium 210 on the human body.  Thisthe Kremlin denies anything to do with it.  Uh, this is a picture of Viktor Yushchenko, during his successful bid for the Presidency of the Ukraine, over the Kremlins objections, these are the effects of dioxin on the human face.   [00:12:20:09]  The Kremlin denies anything to do with it.  Uh, to get to the bottom of such stories, can we turn to the Russian media.  No, not likely.  Theyve been murdered, harassed, taken over, again the trajectory in the early 90s, when that optimistic dinner with Garry Kasparov took place, Russia had a lively press, you could quarrel with what they wrote, but they could say what they wanted to, the shutdowns and takeovers since then, and I include a very partial list  NTV, the independent TV station, ORT, all sort of coopted by government forces.  The newsweekly Itogi Savonia [PH], TV-6, Kommersant, the list goes on.  The broad narrative over this time is that there have been phases and steps forward and back, to this direction that the Russian government is taking.   But, the broad arc, is that in the early 1990s, everything was up for grabs, the rules, the property, the whole thing, it was being sorted out. At this point, the shake-out has largely taken place.  What do  we see.  The government has effectively reabsorbed the revenues coming from such oil and gas giants as Yukos and Gazprom. Uh, weve seen them murdering of journalists, weve see the targeting of businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who wanted to engage on Western terms with Western business.  Weve seen the increasing control over the regions, weve seen the rising charade of elections with President Putin now suggesting he might want to stay on as Prime Minister.  Again the rise of the authoritarian state.   Again, does this make Russia our enemy.  Umyes, thatsand the reason why is, governments such as this need enemies to justify what they do, to deflect anger and frustrations, to show that they are important and necessary.  And in Russiasthe RussRussia in the sense of those who now rule In Russias quest to do that the real rival is the US.  And, following, sort of the initial and conditional cooperation we saw in a sort of sunny phase just after September 11th even that was problematicRussias government has become increasingly hostile and confrontational.   If I run out of time my colleagues are going to cover more for you, but, lets give a few examples. Uh, Putins polarizing speech in February in Munich accusing the US of, quote, singling out the US, of forcing its will on the world, and accusing the US of undermining international security. Quote, One state, the United States, has oversepped a stepped its national borders in every way, he said.  You can find a great many more examples of states, you can argue about US policy but, he was directing this at the US for the world to hear.  Um, according to a recent statement by the US Director of National Intelligence, Russia now spies on the US nearly as much as during the Cold War.   Uh, the difficulties raised for neighbor nearby states, uh, which are inclined to be friendliest to the US, includinglobbing a missile into Georgia, fiddling with gas supplies to the Ukraine, waging cyberwar on Estonia, and, finally, Iran, where Russia has spent more than a decade over US protests transferring nuclear technology.   Uh, and at the UN in Security Council efforts to do something about this has been, one of the prime obstacles, watering down resolutions, objecting, signing only when', 'it may, mayit couldnt really do much more.  Oil prices. Russia has every interest in keeping those high, roiling the Middle East, making trouble that isininimical to US interests. Six years ago President Bush looked into President Putins eyes and thought he saw a friend of the United States of America.  If only.  What we have been learning since then as Russia charts its course, its direction of becoming, is that in Americas dealings with the Kremlin, it is wiser as with any antagonist, foe, opponent, enemy in the making, to watch your back.  Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, with due respect, I think the motion tonight is not what we should doabout the fact that Russia is becoming our enemy again, but is it becoming our enemy again.  And, uh, so, Im actually not going to suggest a policy in reaction tonight, but, I would like to just mention that, from the opposing side, and, again I stress, I wish they were right, but I urge you tolook at what we are presenting, and vote that they are not.  Um, weve heard about, and Im quoting here, the cool peace.   The challenge.  The heightened challenge.  Uh, and weve also heard the Saudis described as agood example ofa country thatwith which we may have disagreements but they are not our enemy.   That might be a good subject for a future debate. Uh  [LAUGHS]  And, I would suggest that, what wereactually listening to here is, uh the difficulty of figuring out what to do about the fact that, yes indeed, Russia is becoming our enemy again.', 'UhI think that from the Russian point of view if anything its one more convenient excuse.  I mean the, thecould we back up here for a minute.  Umwhenthe Russian government came in, building on the debris of the Soviet Union, and in many ways it is the same Russia   In fact the basic framework for many things, is the same Russia.  Um, they had an enormous challenge ahead where the great hope was that they would build a genuine democratic state, and that required great concentration on internal reforms.  And more and more, what weve been listening to, is a focus on external enemies.  On ways of avoiding that kind ofof actually dealing inside.  What you got instead, was this criminal state, which, is going to basically take anything thats convenient and use it for a sort of rallying point.   So, should he be concerned?  Were not about to attack Russia.  Um, and I dont think that were arguing here this evening that Russia is about to physically attack the United States, were not worried that with their military budget theyre going to launch missiles that will hit New York next week.   Uh, what were worried about, is that they have become a force that is antagonistic, or they are becoming increasingly antagonistic to our interests, and, could I just suggest that this is not only military.  On the diplomatic front, if you follow the United Nations, Russia is over and over again at loggerheads with everything that is in the US interests, uh, both in the debate thats gone on in Iran, uh, in the effort to enforce sanctions on Iraq they were the number-one cheaters. Uh, have done nothing about that, theres been no investment, nothing, well, we have federal prosecutions here into people who did dirty deals.  Um, and, if you go to things like the Human Rights Council, you will find Russia and its votes lining up squarely with countries that I think you can reasonably call enemies of the United States,  if you would accept, you know countries likeuh, lets see, Im thinking on the Human Rights Councilwe get into Saudi Arabia again, but in the votes at the UN forgive me, I need to parse out the councils, atwith more time.   But, they line up with Iran, with Cuba, with Sudan, with Syria, with countries that are very much opposed to the US interests, its that kind of, growingsort of, that trend', 'that were talking about tonight.', 'Thank you.  Um, I think, um, we are not debating here whether Russia is the enemy or becoming the enemy.  Were discussing whether it is becoming our enemyit is possible for the United States to have more than one.  In fact to have several.   Um, and, uh, in trying to frame what were actually talking about, um, the issue actually isnt what wed do about it.  That is a very important issue, its one worth debating and I once heard somebody say, well the first thing that we need to do is start by telling them what we need.  The thing that we rather neglected to do in the 1990s.   We were so busy worrying about what Russia needed, that we neglected to say, we as America need the following things.  Um, uh, there have been a lot of points raised here, the one Id most like to justrefute is, that we are cooperating in Islamic extremism.   I would class in Islamic extremism the activities of Iran.  A genuine terrorist-sponsoring state, I think theres no doubt about that.  And on that Russia along with China has been one of the main stumbling blocks in American efforts to actually stop that nuclear program.  Uh, in the larger picture, is Russia becoming our enemy, we can discuss many ways in which Russias aggrieved, challenged, needs validation, peeved, upset and so on.  But, weve heard here a list of things going badly wrong inside Russia itself.   What weve heard effectively is there is no real check on what is happening with the power that now accrues to the Kremlin.  And, the agenda that will follow is one where weve heard a list, as Bret gave you, of the kinds of things that come from that.  They are dangerous, they are inimical to the kind of values this country stands for. And in some things theyve been downright confrontational, singling out the US.  I wanna tell you just a quick anecdote.  A wonderful', 'An editor of mine once explained, the difficulty with defining insider trading.  He said its a very blurry line, when you really start parsing the cases, but if you find yourself walking around with suitcases full of cash, making calls from pay phones, you can have crossed that line.  And', 'with enemy, may I just suggest that when you find yourself running a Geiger counter over the teapot, and trying to defend obvious interests of the free world', 'Thank you.  [LAUGHTER]']\n",
      "['Well, like, uh, Claudia I wanna preface my comments by reminding, uh, all of you of what it is we are debating here.  Uh, Claudia, Michael and I are not on this stage to argue that Russia is an enemy of the United States.   And you as the audience are not here to vote on whether or not that proposition is true. Rather, we are here to make the case that Russia is becoming an enemy.  So whats at issue here, is the trend, the direction, the question of where allall this is going.   So let me devote my time to looking at in a very factual way, how events have unfolded in just the past year.  Let me remind you that we are on the eve of the anniversary of the poisoning of, um, Alexander Litvinenko. Let me remind you also that Alexander Litvinenko was a British subject.  He was murdered by a lethal dose of Polof Polonium 210, which was a de facto case of nuclear homicide if not nuclear terrorism.  From his deathbed, Litvinenko personally accused Vladimir Putin of ordering the sathe assassination.  Since then, Scotland Yard has pinned, uh, the murder on a Russian businessman, an ex- or if you will current FSB man, named AndreAndrei Lugovoi.   [00:26:20:11]  In July, the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, noted that, quote, The Russian government has failed to register either how seriously we treat this case, or the seriousness of the issues involved.  The Russian Foreign Ministry responded with a brush-off, that they could not understand why British would hazard its relationship with Russia, quote, for the sake of one man.   For the sake of one man, let me remind you that, liberal democracy is constructed for the sake of one man.  In a months time, Mr. Lugovoi, Litvinenkos killer, is likely to be elected a member of the Russian parliament.   In December of 2006, the Kremlin pulled out pulled the rug out from the largest foreign, uh,  investment to date in Russia, which was, uh, Shells 20$20 billion oil and gas project on Sakhalin Island, using transparently phony regulatory excuses.  It happened again in June to British Petroleum.   [00:27:15:12]  The assault on foreign investment in Russia, was the natural extension of the illegal seizure of Russias privately held energy assets, particularly those of Yukos and its seek and its CEO, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, whose prison term in a Siberian, uh, labor camp, has recently been extended. In January, Mr. Putin forced the Belarusian government to sign a new gas contract, or else have its gas supplies turned off in the dead of winter.  Now Belarus is not a friend of the United States, but Ukraine and Georgia are friends of the United States.   And in both cases Mr. Putin had previously used what I would call pipeline warfare to threaten his neighbors, to threaten and bully his neighbors at their coldest and most vulnerable moments. Nexin the next month, in February, a man named Ivan Safronov, a reporter for the, uh, for the Kommersant newspaper, wasor I should say fell from a fourth-story window onto the street, where he died instantly.   The authorities ruled it a suicide, but most observers believe that Safronov, who had repeatedly embarrassed the Russian military with his reporting, was executed, making him the 14th such journalist killed, murdered, during Mr. Putins reign.   The same month, a Russian court condemned nine members of the ethnic minorities rights group Froda, for having a quote-unquote, unsanctioned tea with two German students.  Quote, We were told that under the new law on NGOs, any meeting of two or more people, with the purpose of discussing publicly important issues, has to be sanctioned by the local administration three days in advance, Frodas director told Londons Daily Telegraph.   [00:29:03:25] The next month, in March, an American Russia analyst named Polnamed Paul Joyal, was shot outside his home in suburban Maryland, shortly after meeting a former KGB general.  Four days before that shooting, on Dateline NBC, Mr. JoJoyal had noted that, quote, A message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the Kremlin.   If you do, no matter where you are, we will find you and we will silence you in the most horrible way possible, end of quote.  The next month, in April, Mr. Putin indicated that he intended to withdraw Russia from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, one of the landmark agreements ending the Cold War.   He has since Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed by Reagan and Gorbachov.  The next month, in May, um, ethnic Russians rioted in the city of Tallinn, when the Estonian government decided to remove a World War II monument to their Soviet liberators. Estonia was subject to a convuh, to a concerted cyber-attack, and its ambassador in Moscow was attacked by youth protesters almost certainly belonging to a neo-fascist group known as Nashi, I should remind you that Estonia is a member of NATO and the European Union.   In June, Mr. Putin warned that if the US deployed just 10 ballistic missile interceptors in Poland, then Russia will, quote, have to get new targets in Europe.  Which weapons will be used, he said, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, or some completely new systems, thats a technical matter.   In July, Mr. Putin took a vacation.  In August  [LAUGHTER]  Um, in August, Russia detained a mainstream business journalist for the Vedomosti paper, a paper that is, uh, uh, partly owned by, by Dow Jones, on suspicious of so-called extremist activity, via a law that defines the term extremist so broadly that it can be used to target ordinary political critics of the Kremlin.   Russia also resumed, and this is notable, a policy of sending its heavy bombers out on lowerlong-range sorties, on more than several occasions, Norwegian, British, and finally American fighters have been forced to scramble into the air, in order to intercept these Russian bombers, the first time this has happened since the Cold War.   In September, Mr. Putin appointed an unknown apparatchik, Mr. VicViktor Zubkov, as Prime Minister, and later announced that he himself may become, uh, maymaymay become Prime Minister, um, in the next government, which is contrary to every prior promise he has made, that he would leave the political scene when his Presidential term expires.  This sets the scene for the youthful Mr. Putin to remain in power for a very long time indeed.', 'In October Mr. Putin became the first Russian leader to visit Tehran since Josef Stalin in 1943.  He said Irans purposes are entirely peaceful, Russia has stopped, um, cooperating with the rest of the Security Council on the UN, forcing the US to resort to the unitoto unilateral sanctions.  And finally I would like to make one point.  Just last week George W. Bush insisted in a speech, that Russia is not an enemy of the United States.  Now if that does not convince this audience [LAUGHTER] that our side is right, I dont know what will.  Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]', 'All countries have the right to make themselves heard, the French make themselves heard very, very vocally and often very effectively.  Um, uh, the same goes, its a, its an ordinary fact of international political  life.  But if you are, say, the President of a struggling young democracy called Georgia, and it is the middle of winter,  and you find that there have been two simultaneous gas epxlouh, pipeline explosions, that are piping in, uh, gasoline supplies, uh, to your country on, on Christmas eve, that is a very different way of making yourself heard.  The same happens, of course, if you, if you are Viktor Yushchenko, and you are campaigning for the Presidency of an independent country called Ukraine,  which nonetheless, Vladimir Putin and his, uh, friends in the Ukraine still consider a trsatrap of the, uh, of Russia or excuse me, um, what they, uh, wish, uh, still was the Soviet Union.  And so, the way you go about dealing with Mr. Yushchenko, is by, um, administering a nearly lethal, uh, dose of dioxin, that is a very different way of making yourself heard.   If you are the Poles and you are trying to export simply meat products to Russia and they, and they will not, um, and they will not allow it on rankly mercantilist grounds, that is again a very different way of making yourself heard, and it is our contention, on this side   We are not interested in making Russia another enemy, we wishwith all respect to the psychoanal analysis on the other side, we as, as they as Mark rightly pointed out, we have common, we ought to have common interests.   We really do have a common enemy in Islamic extremism.  But facts are facts, and when Russia or rather, this Russian government, makes itself heard, it makes itself heard by bullying, by violence and by intimidation.', 'On a, on a couple of points, first of all to Ninas point, um, incompetence is not intention.  If the Russians are building brand-new nuclear missile submarines which is, um, a, uh, I would say a bizarre project given the shambles of their regular forces and, uh, what their needs are, the fact that theyre not building them well or the sea trials arent going well, uh, doesnt address the basic point which is that this is what they intend to do.  So thats, thats a point that needs, uh, to be, uh, made.  I wanna, um, get back to something that Mark said as well.  Um, which seems  First of all, I, Im, Im delighted, that we have found finally a bipartisan moment where a former Clinton administration official is handsomely praising the diplomacy of, of, um, of, uh, the successors, and, and I find this one of the ironies of this conversation.   Um, but this comes from a kind of school of, what, what Mark said comes from a kind of school that this is all big un misunderstanding we have with the Russians. They have one view of the world, we have a different view of the world.  We need a kind of therapy session to work through, uh, um, these kinds of misunderstandings and while that is true, uh, in some ways, I dont think it can really account, um, either for Russian behavior, or, as Michael said, um, the efforts by two if not three American administrations to bend over backwards for, uh, um, toand make excuses for the Putin government, in fact one of the great complaints I hear when Russian, uh, usually dissident figures come through our offices at The Wall Street Journal, they will say, why is your President constantly forgiving, acquiescing, making excuses, for, um, uh, for Vladimir Putin.   Theretheres one other point Id like to make if I canif I', 'Well, its, its an issue that someone here needs to address, which is, uh, yes, the United States and Russia, um, ought to have common interests, and yet strangely the Russians seem to work at cross-purposes with what we would say at this table are their basic interests.   Why are they building a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, which Mr. Putin just said he is ready to complete, which in a period of about 15 months, will create 330 kilograms of spent fuel, which can easily be reprocessed into about 50 to 60 Nagasaki-type bombs, is that the Russia interest?', 'Uh, none of us on this side wish to see Russia, um, as an enemy again.  We are not looking for another enemy.  We have enemies enough in places like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq.  The battle against Islamic militancy and radicalism is one that we would do, we would do better to fight alongside Russia, not at cross purposes with it.  We also dont want to needlessly antagonize Russia with rhetorical excesses.  But as Vaclav Havel said, told me when I interviewed him in June, with me, Ras- Putin, as he called him, becomes more and more suspicious. We have to tell him plainly what we think of his behavior.  Mr. Havel has a philosophy about that, its called living in truth.  So lets tell Mr. Putin the truth, lets tell ourselves the truth, the truth.  We worry about the political trends within Russia, not just because we are friends of democracy, human rights, freedom, the rule of law, but because the respect the governments have for their own people tend to correlate with their attitude and behavior vis--vis', \"the outside world.  We worry about Russian behavior toward countries like Ukraine, Estonia, and Georgia, because we fear that that behavior is a harbinger for whats in store for Europe and the United States.  And we look on the trends in Russia, in Russian attitudes towards journalists, human rights groups, foreign investors, neighbors, toward their own history, and finally towards us with growing alarm.  And the direction seems clear and unrelenting, and it leads us to conclude that Russia is on its way toward again becoming an enemy of the United States, and we won't be able to do anything to change that until we come to terms with the reality that we are facing.  Thank you.\"]\n",
      "['Thank you, Edward.  Its great to be here up in Manhattan, I dont get up here a lot but ifif I have to go back to Washington knowing that you folks ratified Dick Cheneys views on Russia, uh, I dont know what Im gonna be doing for the next week but certainly Edward will have to change the lead of his article, uh, for next week.   Umfirst, US Presidents since George Bush the elder, President Clinton, this current President Bush have bent over backwards, to make sure that Russia doesnt become our enemy.  Weve done practically everything possible from subsidizing their economy to looking the other way at a lot of their transgressions to make sure that, that, uh, that we dont offend Russia, we dont try to overmake them overreact.   We dont criticize them too harshly and so forth.  And, uhbut while we were doing that we chose to look the other way, when certain elements of the old Soviet regime, uh, regained power, consolidated power with gangster interests that took advantage of the economic reforms, and seized control in the form of Vladimir Putin.   And that is the former secret police, uh, the Chekists, the KGB, who have managed to take control of a formerly of a former democratic experiment, and turn it into a dictatorship.  And any secret police system in the world needs to have a foreign enemy in order to justify its own political grip on power.   So, given that, its the will of the Putin regime itself to have the United States as an enemy, and to become an enemy of the United States in order to perpetuate itself in power.  This was revealed in Kommersant Daily in, in early 2000, after Putin became President, when Putins chief of staff and the state security chief Petrushev, got together and they decided the democratic institutions should not be nurtured.  In fact they should be, uh, there should be a return to, to rule by force in Russia.  And they recommended exceeding the Constitutional limitations on the power of the Presidency, to create this dictatorship.   And to create the necnecessary conditions not just in Russia, but in the near abroad, which is the old Sovietspeak for the, for the former Soviet empire.  So there was a clandestine manipulation and, and oppression of political parties, of politicians.   We saw the faces of, of, of one of the Ukrainian politicians who, who happened to run afoul of them.  Another one of those politicians, Galina Starovoitova was on our editorial board,  she was murdered before, before this document happened but another one of our members of our editorial board, Yuri Shekoshekin [PH], uh, editor, very brave editor was, was poisoned to death, uh as aas a staunch critic of the KGB- ization of the new Russian government.   This document, uh, was designed to promote Putin as the President, and to, and to wage, quote, preventive political action.  Throughout Russia, and to plant KGB personnel, throughout the Presidency,  throughout the government ministries, in control of the armed forces as it never had been before, and in control of governorships, and administrative regions across the country.   At the same time there was no accountability or national reconciliation so if you look at, at South Africa after apartheid they had truth commissions to uncover the crimes of the past, or Chile, or Argentina, or El Salvador, or Poland, or East Germany, or the Czech Republic.   Or so many other countries that had been under a tyrannical government, had tried to come clean and expose the secrets of the past and theand theand those who were responsible for committing those crimes against humanity. That was never the casein Russia.  Where there was a de- Stasification campaign in East Germany against the Stasi, there was nothing of the sort in Russia.  So no one has broughtbeen brought to trial, no one has been, been exposed or held accountable for any of the crimes of the past.   And as a result of that lack of accountability, and lack  of national introspection, its become normal among most Russians to be treated as they had been.  And so there is no coming to terms with the past, no breakno de-Nazification, imagine having a, a free West Germany without de-Nazification.   And allowing former Gestapo to stay in their posts, and even become President of the country, itits the moral equivalent there.  So, allover time theyve whittled away at human rights, theyve whittled away withat a free press and everything else.   At the same time, this summer, the Russian government came out with an ideological guidelines [sic] for social studies and history for public schools in Russia. And its a Kremlin-imposed guideline.  Putin himself addressed the teachers and the academics at the book launch, he said, We must not allow others to impose a feeling of guilt on us.   In the Washington Post coverage of, of this event, uh, they surveyed the stosocial studies guide, they said its, quote, marked by intense hostility to the United States.  And the editor of the manual, Leonid Polyakov, said We are developing a national ideology that represents the vision of ourselves as a nation, as Russians, a vision of our own identity, and the world around us. A paranoid, hostile, enemy-oriented identity.  Stalin in these books is shown, for the teachers guidelines in the Russian public schools hes shown as, quote, the most succsuccessful leader of the USSR.  And the guidelines on teaching about Stalins crimes are so ambiguous, that theyre not even required in Russian public schools.   And the last chapter of the history guidebooklays out a new cult of personality of the new Russian President.  Quote, We see that practically every significant deed is connected with Vladimir V. Putin.  So this cult of personality is being built, they require some foreign adversary to, to justify the repressive measures they take.   Now the iconography of the old KGB has been preserved, imagine if, if after de-Nazification in West Germany, theyrethe old symbols were still preserved of the, of the, of the, of the Nazi party.  Yet if you go to the Russian police stations, they have the sword and shield, thats the old Bolshevik Cheka secret police symbol.   You go to the Foreign Intelligence Services offices, they have the same symbol, you go to the FSB State Security Services, they have the same symbol. You go to the, to the state prosecutor, they have the same symbol.   So that same conscious iconography of the past, where the sword was there in DrzFelix Dzerzhinskys words, to, to protect the revolution even if it came down on the heads of the innocent.  This is the type of system that Russias preserving. You have an out-of-control spy services [sic], where corruption, uhcontract killings, bombings since Putin has been, uh, suc was first state security chief and then Prime Minister, and then President.   The Russian military intelligence, which feeds on paranoia, the same way it did in the Soviet times, thatthat organization has not been reformed at all.  Yet, that continues to feed on paranoia, uh, of the paranoia, in its intelligence reporting to the Russia military and political leadership, that the West is still a great threat.   Organized crime is, is rampant in a country with a huge secret police system that could easily crush it if it wanted to.  Journalists who investigate organized crime have been murdered, especially those investigating the organized crime in St. Petersburg, where Putin used to handle hard-currency operations before he came to, to, uh, Moscow.   When he took power as President he stuffed the government with KGB people, to the Defense Minister, the first time in Russian history that a secret policeman had been put in charge', 'of the military.  Military reform has not occurred.  In fact the military is modernizing, they have an intercontinental ballistic missile force, brand new, modern force, the Topol-M.  They dont need it.  Were not their enemy, they dont need it.   Right now as were speaking, the Yuri Dolgoruky which is a new Borei class, uh, submarine, nuclear submarine, is undergoing its sea trials now, new ballistic missile submarine, more modern than anything we have, they dont need it.  Theyre buildinguh, an aircraft-carrier fleet is in their budget for the next few years as well, as a power-projection force.  This is not a sign of a country thats seeking to be an ally of the West, and every sign that intendsthat the intent is in the future to have the capability to be our enemy if the political climate so declares.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well  [LAUGHS]', '[LAUGHS]  Well, we reallywith oil prices its like kinda hard to find aa better way to buy them, we certainly dont have any influence with them with our loans anymore with the IMF.  But with the, uh  Inin fact it was, uh, Boris Fyodorov the early finance minister in the democratic Russian government who waned us that, uh, dont loan us a billion dollars from the IMF because thats, thats not enough to help us and its too much to fuel corruption.   But when you look at Putins background where he was in St. Petersburg as a KGB guy handling foreign currency transactions, hard-currency transactions with no checks and balances,  his, his qualifications were that he was a liaison officer to the East German Stasi, for several years.  In fact that was his nickname in St. Petersburg, Stasi.  So, so you have aso, so Stasi comes to, to Moscow to run the Presidential Property Administration.  The, the notoriously honest Boris Yeltsin administrations property-management system, where his daughter also had great, uh, economic interests at stake.  So here, he, he, hes the money-mover, hes the money-hider, hes the one with the KGB contacts to, to, networks to, make sure everything can be done quietly, and efficiently.  Uh, but at the same time, hes a patriot, he does love his country.  And you can have crooked patriots.  And so, so, hes using oil revenues and gas revenues to finance a huge military, uh, uh, modernization program thats anot a reform, not to reform the military cause they still have their beatings of their troops and all of this other nonsense but its to modernize with force projection and with weapons of mass destruction.   Um, using that currency for that, for infrastructure development, and for other things that will ensure that he and his people are kept in power, they cannot leave power because if they do leave power theyll be arrested oror worse, because of the crimes theyve committed.   So, so, so you have sort of a, a, uh, a, uh, a, a Mobutu-type system here, uh,  only Russian-style, uh, where you have a more much more efficient administration than Mobutu ever had but unlike Mobutu, uh, Putins not looting everything.  Hes leaving a lot, for the Russia public, for the pension system and for others so that he gets a permpermanent support base probably for the rest of his life.', 'Thats sortyeah.  [LAUGHTER]  Well, and theyre spending their money in the, the, the nuclear weapons program with the Topol- M SS-27 ICBM, they, they boast that it can break through our missile defense systems yet they complain about how dangerous our missile defense system is.   It doesnt matter whether their submarine has had problems or its over schedule, theyve laid the keels for two more of them.  And the current one is at sea trials now and it is a very advanced piece of equipment and its a revolutionary design so its going to have problems.  We cant pooh-pooh these things.  We cant pretend they dont exist. Theythe, the projected military budget is to build a new strategic, long-range nuclear bomber, and long-range nuclear cruise missiles to go aboard those bombers.   We cant pretend these things away.  This shows, this shows intent of the Russian political and military leadership, and its something that were going to have to grapple with, we cant call them friends for behaving this way.', \"Thank you.  Not even al Qaeda is building a nuclear missile system that can wipe out our entire country.  And we, some of us want to turn a blind eye to those who are doing just that program, and theyve budgeted it out through the year 2015. Now, weve had great relations at times, or common interests at times with the Bolsheviks, with our humanitarian programs after the Russian civil war, with Stalin during World War II.  We even offered him the Marshall Plan aid.  With, with Brezhnev and Andropov with trade, uh, and arms control, and with Gorbachev supporting glasnost and perestroika.  So even at our worst parts of relations with the Soviet Union we still, which was actually communist Russia, we still had a, a common relation.  It didn't take away the fact that they did want to destroy us.  But, I think what the danger now is that anti-government regime propaganda in Russia is so dominant, where they have shut down a free press, they have shut down all of the radio stations in Russia that broadcast Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, thats US broadcasting, except three or four, so theyve effectively silenced us.  I believe theyve silenced the BBC Russian broadcasts.  And then their propagandizing their children, that we are the enemy, that Stalin was not a bad guy, that, that Russia should not be held accountable for the crimes of the Communist past.  So, what the regime is teaching its children today tells us a lot about where that regime may be headed.  It doesnt need to head that way.  What we need to do is call them on it, as we would call a friend or a neighbor or a wayward relative or somebody else, and try to stop them from taking this path that theyve chosen to take.\"]\n",

      "['Thank you very much.  Its a pleasure to be here.  Please dont let the other side confuse you.  This is not about legal immigration. Theres a difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration.  The topic tonight, which the vote is supposed to be on, is illegal imimmigration -- undocumented workers, if you want to call them that  but illegal immigration.  Thats the issue and thats the principle that Im, uh, uh, that Im in favor of stopping.  IlleAnd there are three reasons, basically.  And I want to elaborate on each in a moment.  The first is that illegal immigration is not a victimvictimless crime. There are people who lose and lose in big ways.  And these are the most vulnerable people in our society  not the privileged, not the well-off, whowhom government is suppodoes a very, a pretty good job of protecting  but the most vulnerable, the unskilled, the poorly educated, the poorly trained, disproportionately youth, disproportionate minority, disproportionately women who bear the, the competition with illegal immigrants.  And theyre hurt very badly.  Just because some people win and other people lose doesnt mean its on average, nothing happens.  Its a very, it has a very detrimental impact on those who lose.  Secondly, and I to go back and talk about a moment, illegal immigration does erode one of the basic pillars of this society  the, the rule of law.  And when we make mockeries of our laws we brwe, we engender, we, we, we encourage cynicism about the society in which we live in. Whats the sense of passing laws if nobody obeys them?  And lastly, I want to talk about the fact that illegal immigration exposes in a very obvious way the seamier side of our wonderful democracy.  Uh, the willingness of some to tolerate the exploitation of human beings, uh, in our society, to find some ways to rationalize it.  And the failure to stop this, these sores allows them then to, to fester and make conditions in this country much worse.  It breeds cynicism about what our really core values of this nation are.  But before I elaborate on those I want to say briefly how I got involved with this.  I was inviI became involved in this when I was a very young professor teaching at the University of Texas, when a man named Cesar Chavez came through Austin on the way to try to organize farm workers in south Texas in 1966. And I joined with that movement and I went down to the border for the first time.  I was not a Texan.  I saw the border and I knew right away that the first day I was on the picket line that this strike was lost.  We were overwhelmed by strike breakers and Im saying to this day those, those people are still not organized in south Texas.  And, uh, from those years in the Sixties and Seventies there was no greater spokesman for ending illegal immigration in this country than Cesar Chavez, who sued the Carter Administration for, uh, for its unwillingness to enforce immigration laws before we even had employer sanctions.  Just trying to say these people shouldnt be in here.  That was Chavezs line.  And he believed it very strongly in those days when he was actively trying to organize farm workers.  And he certainly made a big impression on me for the rest of my life. Its also the case that I believe the position that were arguing is supported by the overwhelming balance of reof research and findings about the adverse impact of illegal immigration on individuals and on our society.  I want to elaborate on the three points now.  First of all, with respect to adverse impact, there are ninety million  in a newspaper article just in last weeks Ithaca Journal  ninety million people that are adults in a population in the United States who only have only a high school diploma or less  ninety million.  Thats half of the adult population of the entire country.  Of that number, fifty million are in the civilian labor force.  Almost one-third of the labor force doesnt, has only a high school diploma or less.  The problem this country faces, as this article makes, discusses very clearly, is that we have an over-supply of unqualified people in the country.  Its not that we have a shortage of unskilled workers that we need undocumented workers. And that over-supply is the group that are so adversely affected by illegal immigration.  Those are the people overwhelmingly who are adversely affected in terms of their wage depression and limited opportunities.  Theyre the ones who have to compete with illegal immigration, immigrants for jobs.  Uh, and thats the ones we should, would be concerned with  the people that had the highest unemployment rates.  The highest unemployment rates in the United States are those people in the high school grades, or high school-less, uh, uh, uh, cohort.  Uh, the unemployment rate is, is over, its almost six percent for people without high school diplomas and for those people in some groups, even blacks without high school diplomas, its allits, its twelve percent right now.  So its hard to make any argument that there is a great shortage of unskilled workers when the highest unemployment rates in the United States are held by those who have the lowest level of education. Just what wed expect, but the other side makes it out as if theres a great shortage of unskilled workers in this country that would document, that would, uh, warrant the, uh, the coming of undocumented workers.  That is absolutely not true.  Absolutely not true.  This, uh, this labor market is in surplus and thats the problem.  Why income levels at the bottom, uh, dont go up, wages at the bottom dont go up, why income distribution in this country is coming, uh, increasingly skewed, heading toward greater inequality.  Its, uh, and its, its a very dangerous thing for a society to have happen to it.  Uh, we all know that if undocumented workers were pouring into the professional and legal ranks of this country, if they were coming into the professor ranks or the lawyer ranks or the doctors ranks or the business executive ranks, this issue would have been solved a long time ago.  [LAUGHTER] We all understand very clearly that this, uh, that the undocumented workers coming into the legal profession or the doctors profession five hundred thousand a year, was not good for the doctors in this country or the lawyers in this country who have to invest, uh, invest in their education and training and the, all the rest of it to get to those positions.  Undocumented, not legal immigrants, but undocumented, illegal immigrants.  But somehow when it comes to low-wage workers, low-skilled workers, farm workers, maids, yardmen and all the rest of these things  landscapers and restaurant employees and hotel employees  people forget about the laws of economics   that, uh, that, that, uh, increasing the supply of those workers when you have unemployment already, of high unemployment rates already in those markets, can only depress wages and working conditions and make conditions worse for those at the bottom of our society, and society. So, again, this is the first reason.  Uh, illegal immigrants will always win in the competition for jobs.  They become preferred workers.  Its not that U.S. citizens will not do these jobs. Employers dont want them.  Illegal immigrants will always work for the longest hours, the lowest pay or the worst working conditions because no matter how bad conditions are in this country, theyre infinitely better than they are in the countries that they came from.  Remember, two billion people on this planet today earn less than two dollars a day.  Two billion  half of all the workers in the world today.  Thats what they make.  So any condition in this country is way better than what they have had from most of the countries that theyve come from. So in the competition for jobs they will always be a preferred worker if employers can have them.  My view is they should not be allowed to have access to that supply of labor.  That is a, that, that  and thats what our law says, thats what our law requires. Its just we dont enforce our laws.  Secondly, the, the issue of, of, of the rule of law.  Illegal immigrants, those who enter without inspection or overstay Visas are creating, are committing, uh, criminal misdemeanors.  If they, if they over-stay their Visa  sorry, if they, if theyve been deported and then come back in, its a felony offense.  But we dont enforce the laws.  Uh, they get away, so theres little risk, really in actually following any of those laws.', '[OVERLAP]  Since, since 1986 illegal immigrants who come to the United States, um, uh, uh, are not required to work but they do work.  Again, the laws that are not being enforced.  Im, Im real, way behind, I guess, in what I wanted to say.  Its, uh, its illegal to use false documents, its illegal to, to use somebody elses identity.  Its illegal to use someones else, the Social Security number.  All those things have criminal offense but then nobody applies the laws.  How many laws are these people of, uh, are entitled to violate without people becoming cynical about our rule of, our rule of law?  Uh, uh, drivers licenses, social services, all the rest of it.  Um, uh, the last point I wanted to make was about the, about the, the fragileness of our democracy.  Uh, this exposes the seamier side of it by, by allowing illegal immigration to go on.  It gives tacit, uh, uh, approval to their presence in our society and to its human, its human smugglers and abusive employers and unsafe work environments.  And all those things are, are, go hand in hand with illegal immigration.  The result is to encourage millions to keep coming.  Um, so that they  and it also --', '[OVERLAP]  Thank you.  Much more to say.', 'Whatever happens in the market.  And the wagering.', 'And thats absolutely false.  So you cant use false statements', 'And you cant just lie to people', 'And the reason  The reason that itthat illegal immigration failed during the 1950s was because we had this awful program called Operation Wetback in the early 50s, which was a massive roundup - of which nobody would defend on this side of, uh, of the, of the borders.  And that we had a large number of illegal immigrants.  When that program ended, because of the massive violation of civil rights, illegal immigration went down.  And it wasnt because we hadwe introduced more visas.', 'By enforcing the immigration law along the border.', 'Oh, you want to abolish all employer sanctions.  Thats all you want to do.', 'Thats whatthats what you are saying.  Uh, uh, uh, the reason we have these, these job sites - and these, these roundups and what have you - is because we have got a law that says they are not supposed to be there.  And there are people that it have hurt. There are low wage workers - of all races and ethnic groups.  I am not just concerned about Mexicans.  I am concerned about people of all races - who are both illegal immigrants and those who are hurt in this country [APPLAUSE] by theby illegal immigration.', 'The reason  And thats why you wont address the question of undocumented workers.', 'No.  If, if you want', 'But the bottom line, illegal immigrants dont work.  Thats, thatsthat should be the principle.  And if you would say that, I would go along with everything you said.  But the bottom line of employer sanctions must be  What we are saying isthat illegal immigrantsdo not work in the United States.  Thats the law of the United States since 1986', 'because they dont work.', 'Uh, the current situation we have, of massive user immigration system, breeds widespread cynicism throughout the country by illegals and by citizens about what are American values?  Illegal immigrants know they are exploited, but they have no choice but to take the jobs that are offered to them;  they are still better what they had where they came from.  Citizens are appalled with the lack of concern by their own government country, uh, on theabout the unfairness of the competition that low wage workers are confronting with the presence of illegal immigrations. Perversely, we has set up a system, where those lawyers - uh, sorry - where those employers who try to follow the immigration, uh, laws of the United States are, areor who, uh, or law are put at a competitive disadvantage by firms that are allowed to violate the laws and can under, uh, uhunderbid them and underand undersell them in the labor market.  Currently, by the way, because we dont enforce our immigration laws, we are, we are basically, well, rewarding law breakingand, uh, and those who follow the law, they are actually punished.  Many years ago, the famous CBS correspondent Edward R. Murrow said, The duty of journalists is to separate slogans from policies.', 'I think thats the duty of scholars also.  Tonight, we have heard a lot of slogans from the other side, but no policies.  Our position is one of clear policy - not slogans about scapegoating and nation of immigrations and who we are as Americans and all that.  We are talking basically here about policy.  That if we couldif we could actually begin to enforce our immigration policies, we could then turn to the real issues of whats pushing people out of these countries, that I would love to discuss.  And those are the big issues.  But we cant get to those issues - human rights violations, uh, population pressures, unfair trade policies and all the rest of them - because the system is so out of kilter, because we dont enforce our immigration laws.  We desperately need to do so.  The Jordan Commission said, the credibility of the immigration policy can be measured by a simple yardstick.  Do people who get in, uh - who should get in, do get in?  The people who should not get in are kept out.  And the people who are deportable - are required to leave.  Thats Barbara Jordan.  No racist.  And it cant be said any clearer.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Yeah, and thank you.']\n",
      "['Apparently Im here to argue that we should not love our neighbor.  But that wont be the substance of my talk. [LAUGHTER]  Uh, the other side is claiming that, uh, the flow of people into the United States is inevitable, that its like the tides or continental drift and that we need to lie back and pretend to enjoy it.  The fact, though, is that theres nothing inevitable about, uh, the flow of people from abroad.  Its an artifact of government policy.  The analogy they often use is to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit on an interstate and that its unnatural and therefore it has, thats why people are violating the, uh, speed limit.  The fact, though, is that an interstate highway is engineered for a particular speed.  Its designed for seventy mile an hour traffic -- the, uh, angles, the sightlines, the width of the shoulders.  No economy, our economy is not engineered for any particular level of immigration. It can adapt to high levels of immigration, even higher than we have now.  It can adapt to dramatically lower levels of immigration.  The question is, what are the side effects, what are the consequences, what level of immigration do we want? Through our elected representatives weve made a decision  incoherent sometimes as it is  about what our legal immigration policy should be.  Given what our legal immigration policy is it needs to be enforced, whatever it happens to be.  If its changed, if the numbers are increased, decreased, what have you, the, the law needs to be enforced if its to mean anything.  And theres two ways you enforce immigration law.  One is the conventional method of arresting and detaining and deporting people.  We do that.  We dont really frankly do as much of that as, uh, you might think, but we do some of that and we need to do more of it. But at least as important, if not more important, is the other element of enforcement of any laws --  but specifically in immigration laws -- is to deter lawbreaking, to dissuade those abroad from sneaking in or overstaying their Visas and to encourage, especially the more recent illegal immigrants, to leave and go home.  Um, and the welcome that we have, in fact, extended and been extending to illegal immigrants for many years now, uh, it subverts that second element of law enforcement.  So what that means is we have two choices -- either focus even more on rounding up, arresting, detaining and deporting people, leaving that as our sole approach to enforce immigration law  or just give up enforcing immigration law and have de facto open borders  which, despite all the disclaimers, is what the other side wants.  Now, um, just enforcing immigration law in the conventional way  border patrol agents, uh, immiuh, immigration agents inside the country raiding work places and homes  relying only on that kind of enforcement cant work. Uh, we havent actually done all that much of it, uh, but however much we increase it, it cant be the sole basis of our immigration enforcement approach.  We need to have, uh, deterrence and what you might call encouraging voluntary compliance.  After all, the IRS doesnt arrest everybody.  It doesnt, it isnt in everybodys, uh, accountants office, making sure the rule, the, the forms are filled out properly. Uh, a few people are made examples of, and everyone else - most everyone else, uh, in our country remarkably compared to most places - complies with the law more or less, voluntarily. And so, what is it that we are doing?  What is this welcome that we are talking about?  What does it consist of?  What are we doing to essentially subvert enforcement of our own immigration laws?  Some of these things you have already, um, you are familiar with, of course.  Uh, Mr. Rosenkranz referred to, uh, Governor Spitzers rule on drivers licenses.  Uh, the drivers license is, in fact, our national ID system.  And anything that makes it easy for illegal immigrants to get licenses, means it makes it easy for them to live here and to embed themselves in our society. Jobs.  In 19  It was only in 1986 that the employment of illegal immigrants was prohibited by law.  Before that, it was explicitly permitted in something called, not coincidentally, the Texas Proviso, where employers were held, uh, unaccountable for employing illegal immigrants.  We did change it in 1986.  But contrary to Dans claims, we have done nothing to enforce it in the past 20 years.  Nothing.  Bupkis.  We have gone through sort of, uh, cabooky efforts at finding a few people, as Heather mentioned.  Uh, in 2003 was the low point of enforcement.  And three employers, in the entire United States, were fined for knowing employment of illegal immigrants.  We dont even do basic things like tell employers, that they have submitted a fake or stolen Social Security number, uh, from an illegal immigrant employeruh, employee.  And that matters, because the majority of illegal immigrants work on the books.  They actually gave their employers a fake or a stolen Social Security number.  We dont even tell employers and hold them accountable for making sure that that information is correct. Another example of the welcome we extend immigrants is, uh, bank accounts.  The Treasury Department, just a couple of years agotold banks inexplicitly, in writingthat it was OK for them to give bank accounts to illegal immigrants using, um, the Mexican governments illegal alien ID card.  That that was explicitly permitted by the law, and they shouldnt, uh, be dissuaded from doing that. Um, another example.  In-state tuition.  Now, there is not that many illegal aliens going to state universities and getting, uh, in-state tuition subsidies.  But symbolically, its very important. It is another part of the welcome that we extend illegal immigrants, which subverts our efforts to make whatever our immigration policy is stick. What we really need in ending this welcome is to pursue what Id like to call a firewall strategy.  Make it not just difficult to get in the country, which is something we need to do, but also make it hard to gain access to the important institutions of our societyso that it becomes as difficult as possible to be an illegal immigrant.  So you cant get a drivers license, you cant get a job, etc.  Only in that way can we successful dissuade new illegal immigrants from sneaking into the country, and persuade some significant portion of those to leave.  Thats  I describe that as an attrition policy.  In other words, not magically eliminating the illegal immigration problem, but causing the illegal immigrant population', 'instead of growing every year, to start declining every year.  Its a realistic approach.  Its not a pipe dream.  Heather mentioned the Pakistani illegal immigrants after 9/11.  But, um, the New York Times and the USA Today just in the past couple of weeks have written about how the new, very modest but real, increases in immigration enforcement are in fact impelling significant numbers of people to get the message - that the party is over, and its time for them to go home. It works.  Our research shows we could reduce the illegal population by half in five years, through normal law enforcement methods - not tattoos, not machine guns, not landmines - normal law enforcement, consistently applied.  And thats the key. Normal law enforcement, consistently applied.  And not welcoming illegal immigrants with one hand, while we - in some instances - make it harder on the other hand.  We need a consistent, unmixed message to illegal immigrants.  And youll be surprised', 'Thank you.', 'John, could I just answer that?', 'And I would have to disagree just a tiny bit and say that it is a moral question.  That the nation is a moral good.  Uh, it often doesnt behave morally, but thats a different question.  It is, hmmm  Peoplehood is part of what we as human beings have programmed in us;  belonging to, uh, a people.  And that means that we have a greater moral responsibility to those who are - us - who are, uh, fellow members of our people, than we do to foreigners.  It doesnt mean we have no responsibility to those who live outside our national community, but our priority has to be those who are our countrymen:  Just as you feed your children first, before you give money to charity.  And so, I would submit that, um, that, uh, arguing that everyone in the world has a right to come to the United States is itself immoral.  The argument itself is morally wrong.', 'So should raids be at noon?', 'Should people wear different kinds of hats?  [LAUGHTER]  I mean, I think its a legitimate question.  I mean, I am not trying to make the joke here, but  [APPLAUSE]', 'I, I have to say - and I have been doing this now for more than 12 years, specifically in this job - and I have got to say, I have never heard someone on that side of the debate say, Yes, this specific enforcement action - and I am not talking about, you know, criminals, uh, you know, drug dealers or something - regular immigration violation - that This specific enforcement action is OK.  This, I approve of.  I have never found', 'a single person ever', 'I am talking about actual enforcement, not the', 'not promises of future enforcement.  Is there anything thats ever happened - any enforcement action in the past say 20 years - thats, that anyone on your side would be able to say, Yeah OK, thats good enforcement.  That, I am all for.', 'Never.  I have never heard a single one.', 'And who doesnt?  I am very interested', 'In other words, you are going to acquire', 'Your view requires massive roundups.  And Id actually like to know, from Enrique and Karen, do they support?', 'another Bracero program?  Because thats what he is talking about.', 'Roundup guest workers.', 'Well, thats what the program is calling for', 'Thats what the program is calling for', 'Could I take a whack at that?', 'Yeah, um', 'The, the  The reason immigration policy is relevant to security now, is not just some opportunistic thing.  Well, 9/11 was a big deal, so lets concoct some rationale based on security to reduce immigration.  Kind of like these lobbyists for farm subsidies talk about food security.  You know, The, uh, uh, the terrorists are gonnaare, are trying to attack us, so we need subsidies for food security.  No, this is an integral  There isthere is a reason that immigration policy and security are related.  Uh, years ago, World War II, they talked about the homefront.  That was part of the governments propaganda at the time, and I use that in a positive termway.  Um, and it was designed really The, the use of the term homefront was to get people motivated to, you know, recycle their old tires and not grumble too much about butter rationing.  But it wasnt a real front;  it was a metaphor.  Today, the homefront is not a metaphor anymore, as obviously we all know - its the actual front.  Because of modern technology, modern transportation and communications and weapons technology, the homefront is the real front.  And the number one defensive tool we have - not offensive tool, but defensive tool - is immigration control.  And the fact that we have enormous levels of, uh, illegal immigration.  Half of new immigration, mind you, each years  Half of each years immigration is illegal now.  There is 800,000 illegal aliens settled here each year, plus 800,000 new legal immigrants coming from abroad.  The fact that we permit this is an enormous vulnerability.  Because any system that the Mexican illegal busboy can get through is something that a terrorist can get through.', 'And the fact is that all of our borders have been used by terrorists.', 'Sure.  Now, good question.  Um, we looked actually, uh, afterafter 9/11, we looked at the 48 al-Qaeda related terrorists who had either committed criminal acts or who had been arrested before they were able to commit their crimes, starting with the first World Trade Center attack, finishing with 9/11. And there were a lot in between - either smaller attacks, or conspiracies - that were, um, interrupted.  And the majority of those people committed immigration violations.  The fact is that a more, uh, vigorous, consistent, comprehensive enforcement of the immigration laws would have exposed probably - as far as we can tell - every single major terrorist conspiracy, uh, against the United States.  Even when you look at 9/11.  The fact is that, four of the hijackers were - in some form or another - illegal aliens.  And one of them came to study English, and then just never showed up, and there was no way for us to know.  Uh, a couple had overstayed.  One had overstayed earlier, and shouldnt have been allowed back in but was.  Others  One of them was an illegal alien and was stopped by the police for driving - whatever it was - 95 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone and nobody checked whether he was legal or illegal.  So that  The fact is that, every major terrorist, uh, uh, conspiracy in the United States - every effort at attacking the United States has involved - must necessarily involve immigration law.  And has - almost inevitably, and almost always will involve - violations of immigration law', 'that if we detect', 'we can unravel', 'Oh, so we discovered the Arabs first.  OK.', 'We want to stop it coming.  Is that it, Enrique?', 'And I am a bad person.  [LAUGHTER]  I would love to debate what the level of legal immigration should be, how we should organize it, who we should pick, who we should not.  In fact, I have a book coming out in the summer that, uh, addresses that very question [LAUGHTER] from Sentinel, available in July. [LAUGHTER]  Um, but thats', '[LAUGHS]  Thats not the debate before us, though.  The question really we are facing, for our purposes tonight is, are we willing to enforce the law?  We have a heard a lot of ifs and woulds and shoulds and need tos from the other side about enforcement.  But I think we all understand that if the Bush amnesty bill that was debated in the Senate this summer had passed, that, um, the commitment to enforcement would last only until the last illegal alien in line got his green card - at which point it would just, like in 1986, evaporate.  And a few years after that', 'we would have a burgeoning illegal population, because the market does not determine illegal immigration - our policies do, in large part - and we would have the same debate, saying We need to have realistic laws that legalize all the next batch of illegal immigrants.  We need to decide - are we willing to enforce the borders of the United States and the laws determined by the American people through their elected representatives - or do we want, in effect, to abolish American sovereignty and embrace the, say, E.U. or other, uh, model that the other side has usedwhere we, the American people, no longer decide what our immigration policy is.']\n",
      "['Thank you very much, John.  Two principles require that we stop welcoming undocumented immigrants, otherwise known as illegal aliens  respect for the rule of law and respect for facts on the ground.   The ongoing violation of our immigration laws has reversed the traditional roles in a sovereign nation.  It is now people living outside our border who determine our immigration policy, not Americans.  The facts that result from this constant violation are these:  a significant portion of the children of illegal Mexicans and Central Americans are adopting an underclass culture, as anyone can verify for himself by looking at social statistics or spending time in heavily Hispanic schools.  Until we figure out how to prevent this from happening our unrestricted immigration flows guarantee social problems for years into the future.  Now, on paper, our elected representatives continue to make our immigration rules.  In reality, however, the power to determine who comes into the country and on what conditions, the most basic attribute of sovereignty, has passed from Congress to the world at large.  A net half million aliens enter the country illegally each year.  Once inside, they have enjoyed virtual immunity from any risk of penalties, as well as receiving a host of taxpayer benefits. Such immunity is now considered an entitlement.  Any hint of enforcement, no matter how limited, inevitably provokes a massive outcry from immigrant advocates and immigrants themselves, that the government is behaving unfairly and, indeed, unlawfully.  Disapproving headlines will blare from newspapers across the country.  Quote:  Fear among immigrants spreads, unquote.  Mexican Consul Generals will complain bitterly that the government is psychologically abusing their countrymen by causing them to worry about their status.  It seems that not only illdo illegal aliens have the right to live here without being deported, they also have the right to live without thinking that they face even a minimum risk of being deported. This sense of entitlement does a great injustice to the thousands of law-abiding foreigners who are patiently waiting to enter the country legally. And it makes a mockery of our laws.  I would like to ask our esteemed opposing team if they think that anyone should ever be deported for coming into the country illegally or whether they believe that once across the border he should be home free.  Now, you may hear from Mr. Griswold tonight that our immigration laws are economically unwise.  I and my colleagues vehemently disagree.  But even if it were the case that controlling the border was bad economic policy, the sanctity of the law does not rest on whether it meets someones idea of optimal economic efficiency. Until the American people decide to change the law it should be respected and enforced.  You may also hear tonight that we have tried immigration enforcement and that it has failed and therefore that we have no choice other than to allow the present inflood to continue. In fact, until a few months ago, there has been almost no immigration enforcement in the interior of the country.  In 2004 a mere three firms were issued fine notices for employing illegal aliens out of the hundreds of thousands of such law-breaking employers across the country.  To be sure, the country has progressively put more agents on the border.  But once an illegal alien got across the border he entered a three million square mile sanctuary zone.  This means that mass deportation is not required to revive the effectiveness of our immigration laws.  The illegal population has burgeoned precisely because illegals assume they face absolutely no risk of enforcement, as the complaints about psychologically harassing illegal aliens with de minimis enforcement show.  Increase that risk even slightly and calculations change.  After 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security deported fifteen hundred illegal Pakistanis living in, in New York, leading fifteen thousand more to leave on their own. A modest increase in enforcement would result in a similar reduction over time of the broader illegal alien population.  The second principle supporting tonights motion is respect for facts on the ground.  Those facts show that unrestrained illegal immigration is producing an underclass culture among many children of Hispanic illegal aliens.  Talk to students in any heavily Latino school and youll hear something like this  told to me by an undocumented Guatemalan girl in Los Angeles  Quote: \"Most of the students I hung out with when I started school have dropped out.  Others got kicked out or got into drugs.  Five graduated and four homegirls got pregnant.\"  This testimony is perfectly representative.  Hispanics now have the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country.  Moreover, fifty percent of Hispanic children are born out of wedlock, a rate two times that of whites and three times that of Asians. The stigma against unmarried child-rearing among teens has virtually disappeared.  Hispanics have the highest school dropout rate in the country  fifty percent.  And gang life is sucking in large numbers of Latino youth.  The incarceration rate of Mexican-Americans jumps eightfold between the first and second generation, resulting in an incarceration rate three and a half times that of whites.  Gang counselors in schools from Washington, D.C. to San Diego ', 'despair at the fact that younger and younger kids are joining gangs.  To be sure, most Hispanic immigrants are industrious strivers who seize every opportunity available to them.  But as long as many of the children are assimilating into the underclass and adopting its values, maintaining the current high levels of illegal entry will bring in its wake rising welfare and crime.  In conclusion, we should continue to welcome legal immigrants who have respected American law from the moment they entered the country and in the way they entered it.  But it is an insult to them to accord the same privileges to so-called undocumented immigrants who have chosen to flout the law.  And it is not in the countrys self-interest to do so.  Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, I, uh, I sort of reject the question, John, cause I dont think its necessary to put an absolute number on it.  I would think success would be, uh, seeing the changed decision making that, that Mark and I spoke about.  That once you start enforcing the law, you are gonna see much fewer people come across the border.', 'In, in one stretch of Texas that started, uh, not just putting people on the border, but detaining them, uh, after they were apprehended - rather than the current catch and release policy - there has been a 50 percent drop in illegal, uh, crossingsin a few months.  The Washington Post itself declared that this shows that the way to get control of the border is simply to enforce the lawson the books.  We dont need new laws;  we just need to enforce whats already there', 'something that has not been done.', 'I, I, I really couldnt predict.  But fewer  Any fewer would be a success.  Whether it would be half that, uhI, I cant say.  But the fact is, is that right now, we are sending a message to the, hmmm, billions of people in this world that, once they get across the border, nothing happens to them.  If we have an amnesty, I can predict what will happen:  More will be coming in illegally. That is what the consequences have been of every amnestyin this countryand in Europe.  Uh, that record is quite clear.', 'Thank you. GERRY OHRSTROM Uh, given my utterly blind luck in being born American, by what moral authority can I deny that same opportunity and privilege to any of the worlds other six billion inhabitants?  And any of your colleagues are welcome to respond to that as well. HEATHER MAC DONALD I think it is what nations do.  They have borders.  Uh, if you are suggesting that there should be no more nations in this world, that is a very radical change.  Uh, and I dont think that our, uh, neighbors to our south would agree with that either.  [LAUGHS] You know, uh, Enrique talks about our inhumane laws.  Well, Mexico has about the fiercest, uh, border patrol that you can imagine, that rounds up Central Americans that are coming in transit to get to the United States.  Uh, this has been a prerogative of nations uh, throughout history, to decide who comes in.  It, its not a moral question.  Its simply the right of, of nations to decide who is, is within their borders and who is outside of them.  Mexico, uh, you know  Several years ago, a governor of Baja suggested that perhaps Mexico has some responsibility for preventing these deaths, uh, in the desert, because they have a law that requires people leaving the country to exit through lawful ports of exit and entry.  Uh, and he suggested that maybe if Mexico started enforcing that law, it would decrease the deaths.  And of course, this created a massive outcry, uh, among the Mexican elites, who believe that it is the right of Mexicans to immigrate into the country illegally.  I disagree with that and I think, uh, Mexico itself would say the same about people from Nicaragua and El Salvador.', 'But it does sound like thats the choice.  I have yet to hear anybody on the opposing team say whether they think there should ever be any immigration enforcement.  Do you think a penalty should ever be levied against somebody who comes?', 'into the country?', 'What would you do?', 'But tell me what you would do', 'if somebody comes into the country illegally.', 'But thats not immigration laws', 'But it is enforceable', 'But let me', 'Which?', 'Well, we have heard, I think, a lot of, uh, sleight of hand by the opposing team, which is to conflate illegal immigration and legal immigration.  They basically have been debating a proposition that is not before us tonight, which is - we should continue welcoming legal immigration.  All of our team member is for that. We agree that legal immigration is part of this countrys history. Uh, it is appropriate.  It is, uhit brings values.  But, but one of the values that this country stands for, is the rule of law.  Uh, if we continue to wink at illegal immigration, I think that we are cutting away at the fabric of what makes this country great. There is nothing inhumane about enforcing laws in a color-blind, fair manner.  We have yet to do that.  Uh, but it is not inherently', 'inhumane to have an immigration law.  We havent tried it. Uh, when we start, we will be sending a message to people that it is not right to come here.  We are working [LAUGHS] with Mexico. Uh, we are giving them aid.  We are working on the border.  They have a responsibility.  Other countries have a responsibility, it seems to me, to, to, to do something about their own economies, uh, which we are trying to help them with, and to prevent their citizens from trying to come into this country illegally.  Uh, again, we are a great country, and part of that is the rule of law.  And that currently, the system is broken.  The thing to do is to start fixing it, by enforcing it.  Thank you.']\n",

      "['Good evening.  Its a pleasure to kick off tonights debate.  Im gonna start by telling you a couple of things that my colleagues and I are not arguing, in our support for tonights resolution. First, in arguing that spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea, my colleagues and I are not arguing that the people of the Middle Eastwhether defined as Arabs, Muslims, or in any other wayare inherently less capable of democratic development than any other ethnic, cultural or religious group. Second, we do not question the desirability of democracy, or the benefits of living under a democratic political order.  I have the good fortune of being an American citizen solely through the accident of my birth.   But my two colleagues tonight, came to this country from elsewhere, and embraced American citizenship by choice, precisely because they are convinced of democracys desirability.  In arguing that spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea, my colleagues and I want to look at tonights resolution through the prism of American national interests.  Of course US interests in the Middle East are complex and multifaceted, but Im gonna boil down our most important interests in this critical region to three things.  First, the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, second, the security and welfare of the state of Israel, and third, keeping the Middle East from providing a platform for further mass-casualty terrorist attacks of the sort that we suffered on 9-11.  I will argue for tonights resolution because I believe that promoting democracy in the Middle East is not just not helpful for these interests, it is downright harmful to them.   Lets look first at terrorism. President Bush and his administrations defenders have argued since the United States began preparing to invade Iraq, that spreading democracy in the Middle East is the essential antidote to jihadist terrorism originating in the region.   But there is literally not a shred of hard evidence supporting that proposition. From Osama bin Laden on down, that claim that jihadist terrorists are products of economic and political marginalization is simply false.  The 9-11 hijackers were truly trust-fund terrorists, from economically and politically advantaged backgrounds.  Proponents of democracy promotion in the Middle East also argue, that democratization is needed to counteract the distorting effects of madrasa educations on the mind-set of millions of young Arabs and Muslims in the region.  But the fact is that Al Qaeda and other internationally active terrorist groups, dont recruit from madrasas.   Look at it in practical terms.  To be an internationally active jihadist terrorist, you need, for example, English language skills, you need a certain level of technical competence.  Madrasas are not the place where one acquires that kind of skill-set.  Thats why Al Qaeda and other internationally active jihadist terrorist groups recruit primarily among university students and university graduates.  Indeed if you look at the backgrounds of terrorists who have been recruited over the years by Al Qaeda, you find the number-one subject that they studied at university was engineering, the number-two subject was medicine.   Democracy promotion is not going to win the war on terror, in fact the Bush administration has tacitly acknowledged that promoting democracy is not winning the war on terror.  Since 2005, in the annual Patterns of Global Terrorism report, the administration has, as a matter of policy, withheld publishing the aggregate statistics showing the number of significant terrorist incidents around the world each year.   They withhold that information, I would suggest, not because the data show that the number of incidents is getting less.  It is actually getting greater-- democracy promotion will not help us win the war on terror. Now lets turn to Israels place in the region.  Proponents of democratization in the Middle East often advance what I call the garbage-collection model of lowering Palestinian and Arab expectations.  This model assumes that Palestinians and their sympathizers in the Arab and Muslim worlds dont really care that much about Palestinians living under occupation, that Palestinian and other Arab leaders use Israel as a convenient way to deflect popular attention from their own performance.   I myself heard President Bush argue in the White House Situation Room, that a democratically-elected Palestinian government would be more focused on collecting garbage, and less, quote- unquote, hung up on territory and the status of Jerusalem. Well, we tested this theory in the 2006 Palestinian elections, and the result was Hamass victory in internationally supervised balloting in the West Bank and Gaza.  The hard reality is that negotiating peace between Arab states and Israel is not popular in the Middle East.  Arab-Israel peacemaking requires that Arab statesthat, that the United States work with indigenous regimes in Arab states that are prepared to pursue peace with Israel,  not because it is popular, but because those leaders judge it to be in their countries national interests.  This is the approach that was pursued by Anwar Sadat in the Camp David accords.  Sadat paid the ultimate price for that initiative.   But it is the model that has been followed by his successor, President Mubarek, by King Hussein and his successor King Abdullah in Jordan.  It is the model that is being followed today by Saudi King Abdullah in the Arab League Peace Initiative.  Promoting democracy in the Middle East will not enhance the prospects for Arab-Israel peacemaking, it will in fact, harm prospects for peace. The same argument can also be extended to eliciting the absolutely essential cooperation of regional regimes, to enable the United States to play its critical role as the guarantor of physical security for Persian Gulf oil fields.   The legacy of 20th century colonialism in the Middle East, oil concessions, and all the rest, mean that it is not popular for regional regimes to cooperate with hegemonic power.  While there is no evidence that democracy reduces the incidence of terrorism, there is ample evidencefrom places like Egypt and Saudi Arabiathat holding more open elections in these and other societies would produce governments that are more anti-American than incumbent regimes.   Given this reality, how is it in Americas interest to rush these countries populations into voting booths?  A couple of final points.  Advocate of democracy promotion in the Middle East, oftentimes argue that', 'by promoting democracy, we are also promoting the spread of liberal values, the emancipation of women, umand other things that Americans hold right and dear.  Andthey often suggest that, if we are not engaged in promoting this kind of agenda, we really areto use Mr. Rosenkranzs phrasecynical supporters of despotic regimes.  But, if you look at popular attitudes in the Arab and Muslim world, these attitudes are not just increasingly anti-American in their orientation toward international issues. They are less reformist on internal issues than many incumbent regimes.  The best hope for modernization and ultimately liberalization, in the Arab and Muslim worlds today, lies in incumbent regimes who recognize that, first of all', 'economic modernization is essential to their countrys future.', 'Yeahyeah, I just wanted to say, yes, it is possible to make that separation and it actually works in the real world.  Um, one of the few things I did in my, um, service at the Bush White House of which I am unreservedly proud, is that I drafted the letter that President Bush sent to President Mubarek in 2002 regarding the detention of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, the, the scholar', 'yes', 'Um, and basically the tack we took in that letter was, um, we were at that point discussing the possibility of, um, uh, additional aid to Israeto Egypt beyond what Egypt was already receiving.  And we simply said in the letter, you know, youre doing this to Saad has made it impossible for us to move ahead with any kind of initiative like this.   We also said in the letter, you know, existing aid and our strategic cooperation, you know, we hope will go on.  Um, but we sent the', 'but we sent the signal that you cant get', 'you cant get more', 'And', 'we cant get more', 'And', 'in the end, Saad was released in pretty short order after that letter was sent because', 'No, we were saying we want him out of jail.', 'Though we will continue at a present level', '[INAUDIBLE]', 'Yeah.  Americas moral obligation to the kinds of people that you were describing, is first of all, not to lead such people to believe that we will support them in ways that in the end, we will not provide.   Our first moral obligation is not to mislead people.  Our second moral obligation, particularly in relation to Iraq, is not to go to war, when we do not have a coherent and plausible plan for stabilizing a country like that, after we have overthrown the regime.  To do that, I would argue, is the height of moral irresponsibility.', 'I think thatin making your vote this evening, you have, in many ways, a quite simple choice.  If you believe that the alternative to the house of Saud, the alternative to the Mubarek regime, is a group of Western-educated Jeffersonian democrats, then you ought to vote against the resolution.   If you believe as I do,  that under current circumstances the alternatives to these incumbent regimes will actually be worse for American interests, and, I think, worse for the people in these countries, then you should vote for the resolution.   It is a red herring to say that by saying democracy promotion in the Middle East is a bad idea, we basically are washing our hands of any concern about how the Middle East develops.', 'That is simply not true.  There is an enormous ferment in the Persian Gulf today, around economic reform, around, as Liz pointed out, the spread of information technologies, the increasing involvement of the Gulf states, and other Middle Eastern countries in the globalized world of the 21st century. That is not a product of American policy, in fact I would say were not doing enough to support those developments.  Egypt can get a free-trade agreement with the European Union but it cant get a free-trade agreement with us.   Thats nuts, we ought to be supporting economic reform in these countries, we ought to be standing up for human rights, and the political development in these countries will then, over time, take care of itself, and in the meantime, we will be much better positioned to fight terror, protect the security of the state of Israel, and protect our most vital interests in the Gulf']\n",
      "[\"This was an interesting presentation.  I never knew that I believed in all those things.  But its always, you know, a learning experience, uh, particularly when you debate Bush Administration officials or many former administration officials. Your kind of plan, what you mean, what you sought and what you said.  I dont think that this was our position and I hope that you will make your own judgment, whether the previous presentation really reflected our side's.  How can one be against democracy promotion?  A very prominent American leader once said, It is our destiny to promote democracy worldwide because we cannot yield moral ground to repressive regimes because it would be unjust and wrong and because, also, it could be never secure as long as there are repressive regimes.  Because they would not leave us alone and would continue to plot against us. Sorry, France, it was not a prominent American.  It was Leon Trotsky.  [LAUGHTER]  And of course, he spoke not about promoting democracy but promoting proletarian revolutions.  But he believed in proletarian revolutions very strongly. He was a sincere man.  So were many Crusaders when they invaded the Middle East and you remember what has happened and what did it cost  to the Arabs, to the Christians, to the regions.  Uh, we are not talking about our private beliefs.  We are entitled to our beliefs.  But democracy is not a religion. Democracy promotion should be policy.  Therefore I will not hesitate to say that there are some things that are more important than democracy.  If, uh, and then in 1930s, we knew what Hitler would do to the Jews and to the others, would we allow him to come to power democratically?  Wouldnt we consider stopping him a wise and honorable policy?  And I completely agree with the Israelis now when they would not want to recognize democratically elected Hamas.  And I do not care how many votes Hezbollah gets, but as long as they do what they do we should judge them not by the process to which they came to power, but what theyre doing to themselves, to others and what they present to the United States. I would yield to no one in my commitment to freedom.  Freedom - -  to select democracy for us and to freedom to allow others to make their own choices.  I am touched by anecdotes about Arab women.  I dont need anecdotes when I hear about two and a half million Iraqi refugees  two and a half million, for whom in the name of democracy promotion we are doing almost exactly nothing.  And more than a hundred thousand civilians who have died so far in Iraq and more dying.  And our democracy promopromoters dont seem to be extremely concerned.  There was a very prominent American who said, in 1964, that extremism in defense of freedom is no vice.   His name was Barry Goldwater.  I disagree.  Extremism in the name of whatever is never a virtue.  And extremism is never a sound policy. First about democracy as something that stopstops wars  remember, the Peloponnesian War among the Greeks.  More than twenty-five hundred centuries ago and there were democracies on both sides.  Now, I just came from Washington.  Who, uh, do you think burned Washington in 1812?   My impression is that this was the British.  And of course, they had a monarchy but they were very democratic by standards of the time.  Now, more Americans have died in the Civil War than in any other war in American history.  Would you disagree that the Confederacy was democratic  at least by the standard of the time?  And what about the British in South Africa, fighting each other at the end of the 19th Century.  Democracies do go to war against each other.  Now, about democracy and terrorism  well, you know, I think that one of the most democratic countries I know is called Britain. And you see British born citizens engaging in the most vicious terror against their country.  Well, you would say, but this may be terror imported.  Well, about, what about the Basques in Spain?  What about IRA and their long war against Britain? What about the Oklahoma City bomber?   Come on, we know very well that there are many causes of terror.  And to say that the absence of democracy in Saudi Arabia and Egypt really is responsible for September 11th -- you know, a claim like that has no scientific evidence whatsoever, is not based on interviews with the terrorists themselves.  No senior CIA official who knows how these suspects were interviewed and what they said would ever claim that these people have attacked the United States because their Arab regimes were not democratic.  People love freedom, I completely agree with that.  But, you know, when people love freedom they may not only that they would be able to vote or even to enjoy free press or even, uh, freedom of religion or even that they would be able to travel. You know what they also mean?  They mean that they want to be able to make their own choices, including to make their own mistakes.  And thats what the American Revolution was all about.  And when the only remaining super power is coming to other countries and uses considerable American leverage and sometimes American military power telling them, Follow our indispensable guidance or else pay the price, then some people are unhappy.  And people who are unhappy, are not just despots\", 'and theyre not just some brainwashed people.  India is the greatest democracy, in terms of numbers of people in India, and by now they have a long experience with democracy.  And yet India is very strongly against democracy promotion.   We should believe in democracy for ourselves, we should promote freedom of choice for others, but we should not presume that we know all the answers, and as the only remaining superpower, we should be the judge and the jury, however noble our intentions may be. [APPLAUSE]', 'You know   When I hear this argument, that we should criticize every government, uh, we disagreement with in terms of their domestic practices, I want to ask people in the audience before the vote, to ask themselveswhen was the last time you assaulted, even if for rhetorically, your business partners.  When if you are a lawyer, when was the last time you told a judge that he was a jerk.  Uh, when you came to school where your children study, and there told the principal that you have no confidence in them.   You know whatif you have to work with people, not because you appointed them, not because you selected them, but because you need to work with them, you have to know when to stop.  You dont need to praise them artificially.   You do not need to pretend like President Bush did, that, uh, President Putin had a wonderful pro-democracy soul.  [LAUGHTER]  But, you do understand that if you need Egypt, if you need the Saudis, to help you with the Middle East peace process, to create an impression that we are trying to overthrow their governments, well, you know, its a little inconsistent.  [LAUGHTER]   It is counterproductive.  And I think like with every good thing, we need to know when to stop.  And the Bush administration did not know, and still does not know when to stop.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, you know', 'When I came to the United States, one of the first things, uh, I did, was, uh, to become a secretary of the advisory board of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews.  And I was a strong supporter of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.', 'There is absolutely no contradiction, between, uhhelping people like Mr. Sharansky, who is a genuine hero, and whose courage I greatly admire, and also understanding some practical interests.  Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union an Evil Empire. Ronald Reagan also, immediately after his assassination, uh, wrote a handwritten letter to Leonid Brezhnev, suggesting that they should find a way to work together.  You need to find the balance.  The Bush administration doesnt know how to do it.', 'Well, I', 'I most definitely would not be allied with Khmer Rouge.  I most definitely would not be allied with Ahmadinejad, and I most definitely think it was a mistake for us in the past to be seen allied with Saddam Hussein.  But I would have to make one qualifier.   That is unless of course, we are facing an apocalyptic threat.  That is why Winston Churchill decided to be allied with Stalin.  And if you would look at Churchills record, vis--vis Communism, he probably was most brutal in, uh, being quite honest about what a horrible regime they had in the Soviet Union at that time.   But in comparison with Hitler, and Im not even sure quite that Churchill was making just a moral judgment, he was making a strategic judgment, he felt that Britain had no choice, and let me say this.   I wish our foreign policy was a morality play.  I wish there was never tension between what we wish, and what we know is security interests.  But there is tension.  And when we are talking about this tension, we are not suggesting that we do not care about the abuse, about those who have no voice.   But we are talking about realistic foreign policy choices.  And friends, if you believe in democracy, democracy starts with the serious and informed conversation in home.', '[PAUSE]  Im glad you asked.  [LAUGHTER]', 'I was, uhuh, bus-riding.  And talking to people in the administration, including, uh, to the Secretary of State about, uh, the need to establish American priorities.  And after World Trade Center, after what was done to American, embassies in Africa, I felt very strongly, that the big target had to be, Taliban, and of course Al Qaeda.   However, the administration at that time was so upset with what was happening in Russia, and so eager to reduce increasing [UNCLEAR] Russia down to size, that they ignored, then Prime Minister Putin, he was not President yet, Prime Minister Putin, suggestions, that the United States and Russia would work together against Taliban.   Similar felt, that we, instead of focusing on all kinds of things including democracy promotion in Pakistan, had to make that that very issue, Pakistani support for Taliban, the central issue in our dialogue with that government.   But we treated foreign policy as a Christmas tree.  We did not want to establish priorities.  We wanted to do everything at the time.  We cannot conduct an experiment in history, I do not know whether to attack Taliban with the Russians, and with the Pakistanis, whether we would be able to prevent September 11th.', '[INAUDIBLE] we would never know.', 'I most definitely', 'Ias a matter of fact', 'I did sup', 'The amount of', 'I did support the overthrow of Saddam Hussein', 'Youre absolutely right.', 'And I have no regret', 'Uh, thats, thats  [LAUGHTER]', 'That is the big issue.', 'I thought that Saddam', 'Hussein was a threat, I thought that containment was not working, I thought we had to go and try to do it quickly', 'and to turn the project to international organizations.', 'Like Mr. Sharansky, I also lived in the Soviet Union.  And, uh, for most of us, the United States was a shining castle.  And the United States stood, not only for prosperity and freedom for the United States, but also for freedom for the rest of us.   The big difference however, forbetween standing for this kind of freedom, and what we have witnessed during last several years, that every American President, before this one, was taking the position that we would protect and defend freedom of Americans, and of the allies.   And whenever possible, would protect freedom of other nations.  The country was not taking upon themselves, telling others on a global scale how theyre supposed to live.  And when you go to the world, and offer indispensable guidance, particularly when you are not particular popular, when you', 'are not particularly liked, you know what?  It creates a backlash.  The debate tonight is not about freedom.  The debate tonight is whether we want to have a foreign policy which makes us feel good, or do we have to have foreign policy judged by results.  And I am convinced, the dissidents in Iran, democrats in Iraq, they want results, not rhetoric.  That is why I am in favor of this resolution.']\n",
      "[\"Good evening.  I think, uh, America should stand up for democracy and freedom.  I think it should be an inspiring model, as it has been historically.  What we shouldn't be doing is trying to pretend like were capable of making spreading democracy a top priority in a world in which we face many threats  and certainly not to do it by force.  I think, if you look at what has happened over the past five years as a consequence of this policy of spreading democracy by force, is that we have a public and Arab world that doesnt believe us:  we have a govgovernments that dont believe us:  we have less democracy, more anarchy, more instability, more terrorism  and even worse, the growing American dependence on the very institutions and the veryvery governments that need to be reformed. In essence, we have given democracy a bad name.  It is hard for people in the region, including people who badly and desperately are looking for democracy and freedom, to think of democracy and freedom the American way without thinking about the horrors of Iraq.  We have paid a price by diverting attention from the important issue of human rights, which we often confuse with spreading democratic systems.  That issue which we should trump and advocate has paid a price as a consequence of this policy.  Let me begin with some of the facts.  The vast majority of people in the Arab world, all polls show, do not believe that we mean to spread democracy in the Middle East.  Most of them believe that were in Iraq and in the region for oil, Israel and weakening the Muslim world.  Even the governments who have faced pressures from us  and yes, they have faced pressures and, yes, they have been told to liberalize  all have believed that this is essentially tactical, that this is done in order to coerce them to cooperate on strategic issue or as a political domestic issue to divert attention from the absence of weauh, the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. And as a consequence, they dealt with it tactically.  They said, The President needs a little political  give him a little election so he can say, Ive got more democracy in Libya, Ive got more democracy in, in Saudi Arabia.  And then once he claims that he has a success -- hes not gonna claim it as a failure the next day - -  and then you can go on with business.  And look at the reality that we have at the moment.  The vast majority of people in the Middle East  when you poll them  those people whom were supposed to be giving democracy to --  uh, the vast majority believe that the Middle East is less democratic today than it was before the Iraq War  less dramatic today than it was before Iraq War. And it was horribly undemocratic before the Iraq War, no doubt. And how is that the case?  Is this simply made up by the media? Is this what people tell them?  Is this what leaders tell them?  Im afraid theres a little bit of reality to that and we now see it in many of the places that we celebrated early on as examples of democracy.  Remember, the three big examples  Iraq, [NOISE ON MIC]  Lebanon and the Palestinian areas --  and you look at where we are in these areas.  But separate from that there was some other dynamic that goes on that we are not coming to grips with  something that our policy does because in, in reality we are not making democracy our priority.  And we, in essence, deceive ourselves when we think we are.  Let me give you an example.  Ninety per cent of the Arab public passionately opposed the Iraq War, didnt want to see it take place.  They told the governments, Dont do it.  Its gonna bring about ruins. Their governments instinct was, Dont support the Iraq War.  But when we went to the Iraq War -- these governments are certainly dependent on the U.S. --  in the end they came along and they provided logistical support and bases and everything else.  And they were telling us that theyre worried about their public opinion.  Well, we had, it was more important for us that they support our policies on terrorism, on Iraq, on the Arab/Israeli issue, despite the anger of the people, than the liberalization. What happens in the process?  How is the Jordanian government or the Egyptian government or the Saudi government going to face up with that pressure that comes from the public at a time of war?  What they do is they unleash security services.  Yes, they have elections  -- and by the way, some of those elections weve had as little as twenty per cent and possibly only ten per cent of the public participating.  It tells you how people, how seriously people took it. But in the end these governments became more repressive in order to quell, to, to, to put down any possible opposition, given the anger of the public.  And this is essentially what we do, even in the war on terrorism.  Who do we think our most important allies in these, uh, countries --   Its not the Democrats.  Yes, the Democrats we theoretically want to empower them.  But who do we give most aid to?  With whom do we institutionally cooperate  the security services who are embedded with our security services, the military, which are in bed with our military?  These are the institutions of the repressions that need to be reformed. But those are the ones we have to deal with.  And Im not saying we dont need to deal with them.  We have to deal with them.  But the reality of it is that the consequence is perpetuating repression, increasing it even as we pretend to be promoting it. Let me, just a couple of, make a couple of points to end.  One is that I believe that all people in the world and all Arabs and all Muslims want to see freedom and democracy. No one likes dictatorship.  And yes, you, I dont think they want a different kind of democracy and freedom.  When I ask them, uh, Name two countries where theres most freedom and democracy for their people they name primarily Western countries  Western Europeans and the U.S.  They know what democracy and freedom are.  People aspire to it.  But one thing they dont want is they dont want anarchy.  They want anarchy even less than they democracy.  And they want to see no occupation.  They want freedom but they want to avoid anarchy and they want to avoid occupation.  And when they see what is going on in Iraq, if a leader in Egypt looks at their citizen and say, Do you want Cairo or do you want Baghdad?  I want Cairo over Baghdad any day of the week, with all the pain that people face every day. And that is the reality of how the choices are seen in the region.  Let me end by saying I am not in harmony with the view that we \", 'shouldnt advocate democracy.  I think we need to advocate democracy.  But I believe that there is a better way.  I think we should focus on those issues over which there is international consensus, like human rights.  We should hold people responsible to treaties that they have signed and in order for us to be powerful in that regard we have to uphold our end of the bargain.  We have to be an inspiring model, not just lecture to people while we have the Abu Ghraib prison.  And we need to work in economic reform because that is the structure that enables true democracy to emerge from within.  Were treating Arab as a passive people that, that need to be told from the outside.  No, they need empowerment from the outside  not manipulation.  Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Maymayif I may, um, Id like to answer this one.  Um, you know, II think there are two big differences here.  Uh, one difference is, that, when we are saying were spreading democracy or were shaping institutions a long ways, that we imagine ourselves but there is no consensus or international norms, thats one thing.   But when we are talking about human rights there, uh, there are human rights treaties, there are international laws, there are norms against torture.  And many of these governments in the Middle East are signatories to these treaties. And therefore, it is a very different order of things, to hold them accountable to those treaties.  And it isand you would get a lot more international support rather than be exposed and be alone in pushing a policy that other people are not doing.   And these governments can and must respond, particularly when the international pressure comes.  So thats one difference that is extremely important because we can mobilize supporter, we can strengthen institutions, we can do it, but the other difference is, is that we   There are twouh, the difficulty in imposing democracy, is a, another order beyond', 'uh, trying to uphold people on, on human rights because I want to say this on, on democracy because I think, we dont have modesty here, its like saying, trust us, we can spread democracy. And we dont have a good record.  Even scholars dont know how to do it.   And yet we want to make it a priority, when in fact, we havent been able to do even lesser things very well.', 'What Liz has just said is actually rather revealing, because I think thats an argument about, uh, not democracy as an end in itself but as an instrument to ento American security, its a its a', 'Wellyou, you know, you cant have it both ways, and I think if this is the tack that was taken, uh, this is part of the problem, you have to make an evaluation, has it served our security, even if you dont make a judgment about democracy, uh, in the same way that we did have a   I think many people in the American political mainstream came to believe that, somehow terrorism is a function of the absence of democracy.  First of all, schoscholars dont agree on that necessary.  But, but, lets assume that that was the case.   Then you have to make an assessment whether we have more terrorism or less terrorism, as a consequence of the policy that we have undertaken, and I think, everybody could look now and make an assessment on where we are in the Middle East, theres more  Theres no doubt, that there is more Al Qaeda in the Middle East than there was before, in our world certainly, and, there is more terrorism in the Middle East than before.  So it hasnt worked with our national security, and it is being in a way, argued both as an end in itself and an instrument of security, when in fact, even the scholars who believe its possible to do it, believe itll take years to do and then meanwhile, all you have is instability.   And what instability is correlated with, is more terrorism.  And that is why we cant have it both ways, so when Hamas gets elected, uh, youre stuck.  You dont know what to do.  Thats the problem.', 'Uh, well II agree first of all that there are people you dont deal with, but you know, the choice isnt between having an ally and, and, and not, I mean, in, in, in most cases there, there areuh, governments that are bad that you dont deal with or you can ignore.   Theres a difference between, uh, uh, applying sanctions or applying some international, uh, punishment on aon a regime, and between going to change the system.  Uh, I think that, uh, were in a great position, uh, and we were after 9-11, to mobilize the international community over issues that were of great importance not just to us but to everyone else.   And human rights is included in that.  And, we have international forums, uh, for a, in which we can take this, we still are the most powerful nation, and peopwe couldve led in international organizations, uh, to tighten, to, to punish, to, uh, to, uh, exclude people who were violating human rights in the international system, I believe that we need to do that.   I think it is important to have moral values.  I think that, national interest cannot explain all of what we do, I dont wanna just be serving my material interests, Im aIm a moral individual, I want my country to stand for moral issues, I dont deny that.   I think we canare capable of it, if were not capable of it as aas the United States of America, no country is.  Were far too powerful, not to have something extra to push for the good in the world beyond.  What Im calling for, is more modesty, more selectivity, moreinternational, uh, organization, uh, type action.  Uh, not the sort of, uh, I dont wanna sayarrogance probably is the word, in this particular case, to say that we know what is best and were going to bring it about, thats not values.   Especially, when the morning after, people are far worse as they are in Iraq, than many of them were the day before.  That is not values, that is not spreading good in the world, that is not, when you have more than 2 million refugees, most of whom were not even trying to provide for.', 'We need more democratic change, more liberty, more human rights, not words to claim we are doing it, and not promises that we can in fact do it.  The train wreck is too long to miss.  It is easy to sell dreams in times of pain, and many after the horror of 9-11 so badly wanted answers.  And visions of spreading democracy were too good to resist.  If something is imaginable, we thought, it is possible.   If something is possible, we thought, it is likely.  Thus is the stuff of wishful thinking.  It would still be worth a dream if the costs and reality were not so unbearably high, if it werent for the fact that the morning after, has been even worse than the day before.  That millions are paying the price.  Theres a time to go with your heart', 'and there is a time to go with your mind.  And this is the time to go with your mind.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",

      "['Bill Gertz:', 'John Mearsheimer:', 'Michael Pillsbury:']\n",
      "['The question before the house is, Is a booming China, does a booming China spell trouble for America?  The answer, in my view, is a resounding yes.  In the next few minutes, Im going to explain why.  But first, what I call the China threat, which is something that Beijing likes to refer to as the China threat theory, is in fact real.  Uh, it is a danger and it is growing.  Um, as a, as the late CIA analyst and White House National Security Council official, Constantin Menges put it in his book  China: The Gathering Threat, he said the reason that China poses a threat is because, despite its economic reforms, it is today ruled by a nuclear armed Communist dictatorship.  This is the source of, of the trouble.  Ive identified what I call eleven sources of trouble for the United States from China, and Im going to list them for you, and then talk briefly with the time remaining on, in some detail on it.  The first is Chinas military buildup.  Number two is the danger of war over Taiwan.  Number three is expansionism over energy resources.  Number four is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles.  Number five is massive intelligence operations to steal U.S. secrets and technology.  Number six is influence operations and so-called money diplomacy.  Number seven is unfair trade practices, including currency valuation manipulation.  Number eight, intellectual property theft.  Number nine, human rights abuses. Number ten, religious repression.  And number eleven, environmental degradation and global warming.  To start with, the most serious trouble for America from China is Chinas military buildup.  On January eleventh of this year, China conducted an unprecedented anti-satellite missile test.  They fired a missile that traveled through space and hit a low Earth orbit satellite, a Chinese weather satellite, destroying it and creating, uh, sixteen thousand pieces of debris, which pose a threat to other satellites.  U.S. official were shocked by this development because U.S. intelligence estimates of Chinas military have been stating for years that China is ten, fifteen, maybe twenty years behind the United States.   That it is so far behind that there is no way Chinas military could pose a threat. What the Chinese ASAT [anti-satellite] test showed was that China is not seeking to follow the U.S. missile for missile, ship for ship, submarine for submarine.  Theyre going after niche weapons, theyre trying to leap ahead with special technology, and theyre doing this in a number of key areas, one of which is anti-satellite weapons.  Officials in Washington estimate that by, within the next, uh, six years, China will have the capability of destroying all U.S. low Earth orbit satellites.   Basically, this could be the modern day equivalent of a space Pearl Harbor against the United States if there were a conflict over Taiwan. Regarding Taiwan, the danger of war over the Taiwan Strait continues.  China has not renounced the, its plan to use force to retake the island.  It is applying pressure, across the board, uh, to pressure this democracy.  It is succeeding in many ways to influencing U.S. policy in ways that would diminish support for this traditional ally.  The danger of China expanding to gain resources is kind of a new, uh, source of trouble that has been identified by some studies in the Pentagon one of which was called the so-called string of pearls strategy.  It shows that China, uh, is developing a string of pearls, bases, alliances along a path going from the Middle East, where all of its, much of its oil comes from, all the way to China.  There are very much concerns that because energy is so, uh, integral to Chinas modernization effort, that China at some point will have to expand militarily, perhaps the Russian Far East, perhaps Southeast Asia, uh, to take over, uh, places that have, uh, valuable oil and gas resources.  Intelligence operations.  Uh, this is a subject that I have focused on in my recent book.  It also, uh, highlights the case of Chi Mak, who was a Chinese intelligence agent, recently convicted in California of uh, of being an unregistered agent of the Chinese government.  Its part of a, a mushrooming spy case, more of which will be coming out in, in the coming weeks and months, uh, which shows that China has been very successful in stealing some of the most advanced U.S. weapons technology, including the next generation quiet electric drive for our war ships, uh, secrets about our submarine force, and as well as the AEGIS battle management system, which is the heart of the, the modern Navy.  As for influence operations, this is another area where China has been extremely successful in influencing policies, uh, against the United States.  We see this through so- called, what one Chinese defector called money diplomacy, uh, buying up former U.S. officials, and using those officials to lobby against policies that China doesnt like.  Uh, this is having a, a deleterious effect on the U.S. economy and U.S. policy because its preventing the United States from truly understanding the directions and goals of Chinas military modernization and its, uh, its general modernization as well.  Representative Randy Forbes, the chairman of the China caucus in the House of Representatives estimates that China spends upwards of one hundred million dollars annually, uh, on these influence operations.   Unfair trade practices and currency issues, as well as, uh, uh, intellectual property theft.   These issues are fairly well known, but I would like to highlight one issue surrounding the whole trade question.  The main policy for the United States towards China has been to trade with China as a way to seek a liberalized Chinese government and political system. Unfortunately, the idea of trading with China as a liberal, a liberalizing factor is not working.  In fact, just the other, just the opposite is happening.  Uh, many feel that Chinas buildup, its military buildup is being benefited by its economic growth, but yet we have seen little or no political reform in China.  This is a, a very serious source of trouble for the United States.  On human rights abuses, I would also point out how, at its core, China has never fully resolved that the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, when pro-democracy protesters', 'occupied the square.  Um, as well, religious re-, repression is also in this field, as well as environmental degradation.  Uh, as many as seven out of ten Chinese major rivers are now dead. This debate has often been couched as, as between engagement and contained, but really, the, the issue here is that what China needs is Democracy, and that is really the, the solution to mitigating these sources of trouble for the United States. [APPLAUSE]', 'On the commercial realities part, Id like to get in a word there, uh', 'Yeah, uh, the issue of uh, Chinas proliferation activities hasnt been raised, but China, uh, as, uh, many of us know, gave nuclear technology to Pakistan in the, uh, 80s and 90s.  That nuclear technology ended up going to Libya, and uh, Iran and North Korea.   And uh, they even found Chinese language nuclear warhead design documents when they dismantled Libyas nuclear program.  Uh, Chinese companies since 2001 have been sanctioned more than eighty times.   And uh, theyre doing this as part of a policy thats usually denied by the central government, but in reality, uh, uh, China is helping these rogue states with its, uh, with weapons technology, both missiles and weapons of mass destruction.', 'Yes, thank, I, I wanna thank the Intelligence Squared for this debate.  I think its a very important, uh, debate.  And the debate were having tonight I think is reflective of a debate thats currently going on at the highest levels of the U.S. government. And that debate can be characterized, uh, on the one side you have Condoleezza Rice going to Beijing shortly before she became Secretary of State and said, We want a strong China.  On the other side of the debate are people in the national security community, the Pentagon, who said, Wait a minute.  There are so many unknowns about China.  We dont know what takes place.  We dont know.  When we have all of these military exchanges that Mike Pillsbury talks about, one of the first questions is, What is the extent of the military buildup of China?  The Chinese will not answer.  When you combine that with Chinas use of deception, that is, deliberate strategic misinformation to misguide us.  We know very little about it. Therefore it is, it is dangerous in my view that we should, uh, want to see a strong China, and that, uh, really we have to keep our powder dry until we can find out what goes on in the inner councils of, of the Chinese system.   Uh, and for that reason, I, I urge you to vote uh, for the motion tonight.']\n",
      "[\"The question on the table is does a rising China spell trouble for the United States.  Or in slightly different words from an American perspective, is a powerful China likely to be bad for the United States?  I think the answer is axiomatically yes.  And I say this not because I feel any personal hostility towards the Chinese, which I certainly dont, or because I think China is particularly aggressive because it was or is a Communist country or it is run in an authoritarian political form.  I think that matters very little and I don't say it because I think Chinas likely to behave irrationally in the future.  My argument is that the best situation for the United States from the perspective of maximizing its security is to be the most powerful state in the international system.  The bigger the gap between you and everybody else, the more secure you are.  To put it in Pentagonese, you dont want a peer competitor in your national system. To give you two examples that highlight this point, think about the United States and its two immediate neighbors, Canada and Mexico.  As you know, we are much more powerful than either one of those countries.  None of you go to bed at night worrying about Canada or Mexico attacking the United States tomorrow, next week, or next year.  Thats simply not going to happen because were so powerful.  Would you trade the present situation for one where Canada and Mexico or Canada or Mexico was twice as powerful as the United States?  Of course you wouldn't, its much better to have a situation where were the most powerful state in the Western hemisphere.  Same basic logic applies to China.  If China has two choices, one it can have a Japan in Asia thats five times more powerful than China, or a situation where China is five more, five times more powerful than Japan.  Which one of those alternatives do you think the Chinese will choose?  Its an open-and-shut case.  Theyd much prefer to be five times more powerful.  And the same basic argument applies to the United States and China.  Today, tomorrow, or at any point in time.  If you have a choice of being as powerful or less powerful than China, or being more powerful, which would you choose if you're interested in maximizing your security?  An open and shut case. Let me spell out the logic that underpins my argument.  Principal goal of any state in the international system, its not the only goal, but the principal goal is survival.  And the reason is, if you dont survive, you cant pursue any other goals.  The problem that states have is they operate in an anarchic system.  Thats political science speak for saying that they operate in a system where theres no higher authority that you can turn to if you get into trouble.  [In other words, if you dial 911 in a crisis in international politics, theres nobody at the other end.  In a system like that, where you're dealing with other states whose intentions you can never be certain of, and you want to understand here that its impossible for the United States to discern what Chinese intentions will be ten years from now, twenty years from now, thirty years from now.  We dont know what those intentions will be.  In a system where you cant discern intentions, and where there is no higher authority that you can turn to when you're in trouble, the best way to maximize your chances of surviving is to make sure that you are by far the most powerful sys-, state in the international system.  To put it in colloquial terms, you want to be the biggest and baddest dude on the block, so that nobody fools around with you.  To put it in political science speak, you want to be a hegemony. Now the question is, what does the system look like today? Situation today from an American point of view is ideal.  Were by far the most powerful state on earth.  We dominate the Western hemisphere.  Theres no state in our uh, region of the world that could possibly challenge us.  We have tremendous power projection capabilities, which is why were called the only superpower in the world.  And in Asia and in Europe, the two areas of the world where there are other great powers or potential great powers, we have no peer competitor.  Theres no imperial Japan, theres no imperial Germany, theres no Nazi Germany, and theres no Soviet Union.  From an American point of view, thats a wonderful situation.  Now, what is the future going to look like if in say, twenty years, China continues to grow economically the way it has grown over the last twenty years? What you're going to get is a country thats economically pretty close to being as strong as the United States, and you could rest assured that Chinas going to turn that economic might into military might.  Theyd be foolish if they didnt.  Youll then have a country thats roughly uh, the military equivalent of the United States, or at least close to it.  That country is going to try to dominate Asia the way the United States has successfully dominated the western hemisphere.  Theyd be fools to do otherwise.  Do you think the founding fathers and their successors in this country were fools because they had attempted to establish, and did establish a Germany in the Western hemisphere?  Of course not.  They did it for good security reasons.  The Asians will do the same, the Chinese will do the same thing in Asia.  We have a Monroe Doctrine here in the United States.  Most of you know it very well.  We basically tell the European and Asian great powers that they have to stay out of our hemisphere.  We dont want them here.  Dont you think the Chinese are going to feel the same way in Asia when theyre powerful enough to think about dominating Asia?  Furthermore, theyre going to dominate, develop significant power projection capability just like we have developed power projection capability. Theyre going to develop a blue water navy and that navy is going to be designed to go into the Middle East, much the way our navy is designed to go in the Middle East.  When I was a young boy, my mother used to say whats good for the goose is good for the gander.  If its good for the United States, why dont you think itll be good for China to try and dominate Asia and to try and develop significant power projection capability? Of course this all raises the question then, how is the United States likely to react?  Its very simple.  We have a clear record here of how well react when other countries try to dominate either Europe or Asia.  We go to great lengths to stop them. Imperial Germany, imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the former Soviet Union, theyre all on the scrap heap of history.  And we played a key role in putting them there.  The United States will not tolerate a situation where China tries to dominate Asia. And as I said, China will try to dominate Asia just the way the United States has tried to dominate and has succeeded at dominating the Western hemisphere.  What is my bottom line here?  My bottom line is straightforward.  The present situation is better for the United States and more stable than a world \", 'In which China is as powerful or almost as powerful as the United States.  In other words, if China rises, trouble is in store for the United States.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Uh, the question of whether or not China can rise peacefully is a somewhat different question than the one that is on the table, and theres no question, as our moderator said, that Ive bumped into the question of whether China can rise peacefully.  Now he said in effect, arent I creating a self-fulfilling prophecy here, because China wants to rise peacefully in the story uh, but yet the United States, because its being prudent, is creating a situation where youll have a clash down the road.  Its not uh, necessarily that youll have a shooting war.  But youll certainly have an intense security competition as a result of my story. Theres no question about that with the possibility of the war.  My argument is that the United States really has no choice.  Because as China gets more and more powerful economically, the United States constantly bumps into the question of what Chinas intentions will be ten, twenty, or thirty years down the road.  And he says, the moderator, that China wants to rise peacefully.  But he cant assure me that China wants to rise peacefully or will rise peacefully.  Theres just no way of knowing.  And in a world where you have a state thats becoming increasingly powerful, nearly as powerful as you, you have to assume worst case about its intentions to protect yourself in case there is trouble. Because as I said to you before, if you do get into trouble, theres no 911 that you can appeal to.  And in a very important way, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and this is why I titled the book that I wrote on this subject, the tragedy of great-power politics.  This is a tragic situation.  The United States simply has no choice but to assume the worst about China and the end result is that youll get that for sure.  [LAUGHTER]', 'My', 'The point that I tried to make in my comments was that the state can have a variety of different interests, and promoting human rights, or protecting human rights and promoting democracy can be, and often are legitimate goals of states, especially the United States.   But the highest goal always has to be, uh, protecting your security, maintaining your survival.  And the point that I tried to make clear here is that the best way to maximize your chances of surviving in the system are to make sure that you are by far the most powerful state, because then nobody can fool around with you.  And once you have ensured your survival, you are of course then free to pursue those other goals.', 'Yeah.  You, you wanna let Daniel', 'Oh, very quickly, on all three questions.  The first one said where goods cross borders, armies dont.  Uh, I think thats empirically wrong, and there was a tremendous amount of economic interdependence in Europe before World War I, uh, and World War I still happened.  And if you look at German-Soviet relations in 1941, there was actually a tremendous amount of economic intercourse, and yet you still had, uh, World War II.  And during the Cold War, in fact, you had hardly any economic intercourse between the United States and the Soviet Union, and nevertheless you never had a shooting war.  Now on the question of whether or not we could possibly contain China, uh, which gets into two other questions that I was asked, uh, and the person pointed out, how could we possibly contain China when we cant even deal with Iraq?   Uh, I would vote that going to war in Iraq was a completely crazy idea from the beginning, and whether or not you can [APPLAUSE] fight the war in Iraq is a very different issue than whether you can contain China down the road.  And the analogy I would point to that makes this quite obvious is our experience in Vietnam, and at the same time our experience containing and defeating the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  The Vietnam War, like the Iraq War was a completely cockamamie idea.  Uh, but nevertheless, the United States, even though it lost in Vietnam still won the Cold War.  Uh, and there no question that the United States should avoid, should avoid fighting Iraqs down the road.   But it clearly has the wherewithal, uh, to uh, finance the defenses to, to contain China down the road.  And this gets to the final question, which is, can the United States remain number one forever, and if we dont, well be, will we be that badly off?  Uh, first of all, nothing is forever, so the United States is not going to remain number one forever.  But I would be willing to bet a lot of money that the United States is actually more powerful relative to the rest of the world over the course of this century, largely for demographic reasons, uh, than it is right now.  Uh, a lot of the doomsayers, who say that the United States is in real trouble down the road are simply wrong, in my opinion.  And I think a powerful case can be made contrary to what were talking about up here that China wont rise, uh, anywhere near as much as many people think it will.  And getting into the final points, are we worse off, or we will be worse off not being so powerful?  Look at the Europeans.  Well, if you look at Europe in recent times, thats true.  But lets go back to 1900 and think about being a Pole anywhere from 1900 to 2007.  Think about growing up in France anytime between 1900 and 2007. Yeah, the last few decades have been pretty good, uh, but if you look at the broader sweep of history, it looks mighty nasty.   And whos to tell what the future looks like, many of you assume that its gonna be peace, love and [UNCLEAR] forever, right, I mean Europe has been pacified, war has been burned out of Europe. Maybe, maybe not.  Im just a very prudent person.  I dont like to take chances.  And that means that I just prefer to be much more powerful rather than [BACKGROUND LAUGHTER] as powerful as the other states in the system.', 'Ambassador Roy made the point that Chinese leaders today dont think about dominating Asia.  And I think hes correct.  They dont.  And the reason that they dont is because they do not have the wherewithal or anything near the wherewithal to think about dominating Ch-, uh, dominating Asia.  The question you have to ask yourself is how are the Chinese likely to think when they look something like the United States today, when they really are very, very powerful?  To give you an analogy, its like having money. Uh, Ive gotten wealthier over time, which is not to say Ive gotten wealthy.  But Ive gotten wealthier over time, Ive accumulated more money.  And I think about spending that money and doing things with that money in very different ways now that I have it than I did when I didnt have two nickels to rub together.  And the point that I would make to you about China is that theres gonna come a point, uh, in the story that were telling up here, where China is extremely powerful.  And I think then, it will begin to think about subjects like Taiwan very differently.   Of course the Chinese dont want to pick a fight with the United States now over Taiwan, they know what would happen, they would get clobbered.  The question you have to ask yourself is in a world where China has a huge Navy, a much bigger and more efficient Army, more missiles, right, and the United States is at a significant disadvantage in East Asia, which is a great distance away from this country, how do you think China will then think about Taiwan and the possibility of using threats?  Id bet a lot of money that theyll think very differently and it wont be to our advantage.']\n",
      "[\"Thank you very much.  As all of you know, here in sophisticated New York, State Department and Defense Department often dont get along.  So it may come as a surprise to you  it certainly comes to a surprise to me  that I agree with every word of what Stapleton Roy just said.  In fact, I believe our team wants to adopt him as a fourth member of our team, because he essentially is speaking in favor of the motion uh, as we see it. And I want to ask for your support for the motion in the way we define the two key words in the motion.  The first word is beware.  And we take that to mean be wary, be wary.  The second key word, Bill Gertz went over eleven examples, is trouble, spells trouble.  In other words, the burden on the other team to earn your vote is to say you should not beware, you should be blithely sort of confident that there will be no problems at all with China.  They have to sustain that case.  Then they have to sustain the case that there will be no trouble from China, forever.  It seems to me it should be unanimous tonight that our team is going to win, especially since Stapleton Roy essentially is working for us. I do want to say he characterized the Defense Departments view of China quite correctly, thats very accurate.  Uh, going back for fifteen years now, Secretaries of Defense and chairmen of the Joint Chiefs have said over and over and over that China is not a threat to the United States.  In fact, often they embellish and say China, for the foreseeable future, will not be a threat.  So thats the public position of the Pentagon.  Its not looking for a war, theres a very high level of confidence uh, that we will prevail in any conflict with China.  Um and what you actually get is a series of factual reports each year that come out that list the eleven examples of trouble that Bill Gertz gave as factual matters.  But Mr. Roy, Ambassador Roy is correct that theres a sense of confidence and not seeking any sort of conflict from China in the Pentagon.  Theres a sense of , that China is not a threat.  And frankly, I have, since were telling autobiographical stories, I have had about thirty-five years meeting with Chinese generals uh, from the first meet up here in the United Nations not far from here all the way to last week when the Delegation of Generals was hosted by us in the Pentagon.  Enormous changes have taken place but not necessarily for the, for the better.  If you go back all the way to the beginning of the U.S. Military relationship with the Chinese Communists, its really 1944 that we began to do some intelligence cooperation against the Japanese in the middle of World War II.  That came out of something called the Dixie Mission that some of you, I think in the audience, look like you remember it.  But six years later, six years later were at war with China.  Tragic, tragic war where the Chinese to this day claimed they warned us.  They used this strange phrase about we won't put our hands in our sleeves and that was supposed to mean were going to send three hundred thousand troops in and destroy American forces.  We didnt understand it that way.  And a tragic, avoidable war took place. Twenty years of containment passed, another cycle began of military cooperation between the U.S. and China.  Uh, our generals and theirs have met hundreds of times.  We in the eighties, under President Reagan, who certainly would yield to nobody in his anti-Communism, President Reagan authorized the sale of six American sophisticated weapon systems to China. Again a peak, by the end of 1944 when we were cooperating closely with the Chinese.  You almost couldn't have had more security cooperation than we did under President Reagan with China.  Three years later, 1989, it had to all be canceled and not far from here out in Bethpage, Long Island, two Chinese jet fighters sort of MiG23 jet fighters had to be crated up and sent back to China.  And we refunded part of their money because of the Tiananmen incident and the heart wrenching effect it had on American hopes for democracy and human rights in China.  Then in the last fifteen or sixteen years, there have been ups and downs as Stapleton Roy correctly pointed out.  But weve never gotten a pledge from China not to use force against Taiwan. Weve never settled, weve never really gotten credit for what Henry Kissinger did.  Uh, President Nixon withdrew American nuclear weapons from Taiwan.  President Nixon severed the military connection.  President Carter severed the fact that we kept two American generals there, one for arms supply, one to plan war with the Defense of Taiwan in mind.  The Chinese take that, those major concessions from us as though they never happened.  And the Chinese rhetoric today continues to talk about how the U.S., if it even sells one bullet to Taiwan, this somehow strengthens the independence forces on Taiwan.  Its simply not true.  We have enormous self-imposed restrictions on our arms sales to Taiwan. So across the board, we have a lack of progress in Chinese nationalistic attitudes toward America.  If you pull out an average Chinese Youth Daily article today and you look up what does it say about the United States, its not very friendly.  We have fifteen major programs now in foreign aid, in helping their banking system through our Treasury Department.  Our Labor Department has a mediation service, going to help them with labor disputes.  Every department of the U.S. government has what, in my view amounts to an aid program, a program of engagement with China.  Very seldom mentioned in the Chinese press.  If you're a young Chinese, you have the impression that America is trying to dismember China, that America poses a military threat, that Americas working with India and Japan to somehow crush China or contain its rise.  All of this nationalistic rhetoric ought to be banned in the Chinese press.  We dont say these things in our press, but it hasnt stopped the worst was 1999, I might point out, when the front page of the Communist Party Daily, Peoples Daily, carried a long article called The Seven Ways America is Worse than Nazi Germany.  And it went into detail about which kind of gas the Nazis had used in their camps, and then there was a paragraph, Ill never forget it, saying the Americans are even worse than that.\", 'So to support our side of this debate, you have to be wary, that is look for possibilities that might happen in the future where things may not be as rosy as we may have hoped.  And you have to admit theres trouble.  Thats, thats all we, we ask for our side. And I hope it will be unanimous, but we dont, we dont have to be, our side doesnt have to be extreme.  We dont have to be alarmist about China, we dont have to forecast an inevitable war. We dont have to say that we should break off all relations.  I mention to you the fifteen aid programs, I want to close my last sentence with just one of the most impressive, to me, we have more than fifty agreements, governmental agreements to transfer American scientific findings to China for free.  Our National Science Foundation, our White House Office of Science and Technology Policy are in charge of thisChinese dont really make a big deal out of it, but its an amazing program', 'Thank you.', 'May I, may I just say I still consider Ambassador Roy to be the fourth member of our team.  Thank you, thank you very much for those comments.  A balance of power is in fact the right approach.', 'Uh, I prefer a wealthy China to a poor, angry China.  Uh, I think the, the issue though PANELIST [OVERLAPPING VOICES] I think Michael just joined our side. [BACKGROUND LAUGHTER] PANELIST 2 [OVERLAPPING VOICES] Its about time. PANELIST [OVERLAPPING VOICES] Its an even trade. [BACKGROUND LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] PANELIST 2 State Departments always thinking the allies.  [BACKGROUND LAUGHTER] MICHAEL PILLSBURY I think the issue is really democracy, and a wealthy democratic China is a better partner for us, a better ally, a better friend than a poor, than even a poor democratic China.  The problem is how to get from here to there without being foolishly nave in building up Chinas economic strength in a way that they also maintain their nationalism.  They maintain their anti-American views, and they, uh, it ends, the situation ends up that we have been gullible and nave over a fifteen or twenty year period.  And this has happened before.   If you read John Mearsheimers most recent book, it really chronicles a number of times this has happened in world politics.  So if you really want to support our side of the resolution, you need to be thinking about this phrase the moderator used, which I love, I think hes working for us too, Dont worry, Be Happy.   Because thats what their side really is advocating.  What I am saying, be wary in the following four or five ways.  We need to continue our military exchange program with the Chinese military, and let them see that were not their enemy.  We dont want to call that off because dont worry be happy.  We need to continue the embargo on arms sales to China.  We shouldnt sell weapons to China.  We should continue the Eur-, our support that the European Union has its embargo on arms sales to China, until human rights improves significantly.  We should continue to do something about Taiwans defense.  We dont have to arm them to the teeth, but we shouldnt just walk away from Taiwan.  And finally, we need to have technology limits on our most advanced technology that we transfer to China.  Right now, its very generous, but there are a few things we hold back, and some people say that was part of their successful test against the satellite in space, is that they had some western technology, uh, at their, at their service.  And frankly, I dont know if all of you know as, perhaps as civilians, ninety percent of your military forces go through satellites. Communications, intelligence, also and every time you use an ATM card, thats a satellite conveyed transaction.   So we are a highly vulnerable society with our four hundred satellites in space.  This test is very serious in January, and the Chinese government after repeated requests has no explanation for it. They just say, Oh, dont worry about it.  Dont worry, be happy. [BACKGROUND LAUGHTER]', 'Thank you, thank you.', 'Thank you.  Uh, I forgot to quote from Nancy Pelosi a little bit earlier, uh, because you keep referring to us as the right, I thought perhaps you should hear a couple of sentences from the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  She was attacking President Bush last April during the visit of Hu Jintao.   She said that she opposed the celebratory nature of the official visit.  She said our own debt, uh, with China is growing so fast, theyll soon be making our foreign policy.  She said trickle-down liberty is not going to work, its an illusion.  She said that we should avoid wishful thinking about China ever being a, becoming a responsible stakeholder.  She said our trade relationship with China has been a disaster, despite more than a decade of concessions, the trade deficit with China has grown from four billion a year to more than four billion a week.  China continues to manipulate its currency, making its exports cheaper and U.S. imports more expensive than they would be in a free market condition.  If President Bush kowtows to Beijing in ways that threaten our long-standing commitment to Taiwan,  members of both parties in Congress will be watching.  She concluded by saying the American people wanted the administration to show resolve in standing up to Beijing.  So all of you supporters in the audience of George Bush, be sure to vote for the other team. [BACKGROUND LAUGHTER] PANELIST Youre gonna vote with us then, right?

      "['Thank you.', 'Thank you.  Thank you, thank you all, and thank you to the Rosenkranz Foundation for their important work inmaking civil conversation really a reality in which we can all participate.  Like to tell you a little story to begin.   Uh, about two months after I started work at the White House in two2001, there was a rap on the door, not a midnight rap, a daytime rap.  Uh, my wife, um, went to answer the door, um, and there on the step was an agent of the FBI.   Uh, showed her his badge, and asked if he might come in and ask a few questions.  Our neighnext-door neighbor, he told her, had just, uh, been hired into a sensitive position in the federal government, and as part of the security check on the next-door neighbor he wanted to ask a few questions.  So he asked my wife, uh, had we noticed anything unusual about them, did they seem to be living within their means, uh, did they, uh, conduct themselves responsibly and respectably in the neighborhood and  She was a little embarrassed because these were new neighbors, we did not know them well but to the best of her ability she gave em a clean bill of health.  But jogged by this, she said, you know, we havent had them over, we really should.  So  [LAUGHTER]   So she invited the next-door neighbors over a few weeks later and they came and we poured tea and gave them cake and eventually my wife congratulated, um, them on, on the husbands new job with the federal government.   He said, what are you talking about, he said ImIm still at Sibley and Austin, Ive always been at Sibley and Austin.  And what we realized, was, that the FBI had meant to come to their house  [LAUGHTER]  to ask them about me. [LAUGHTER]   Tonights motion, is Betterbetter more domestic surveillance than another 9/11, and the question is, more than what?  And my answer is, more than that.  [LAUGHTER]   Now, none of us are here to argue, none of us are here to argue for limitless domestic surveillance.  Um, the three of us on the affirmative side of this debate have a deep and abiding commitment to privacy and liberty.   Um, my colleague, Andy McCarthy, has been a federal prosecutor, his job is to defend and uphold the US Constitution, the greatest liberty-affirming document in world history.  My colleague John Yoo, was on the front line to defend allall of our liberties, and liberties of people all over the world, against, uh, totalitarian conspiracy.   Not only that but in our private lives, Andy McCarthy is a conservative in New York, and John Yoo is a conservative at Berkeley, California. [LAUGHTER]  We understand, believe me, in the most intimate possible way, the importance of free thought, free expression, privacy, and the ability of human beings to speak their mind in debate and conversation, without fear of punishment or consequence or an overbearing state.  Butheres the question for today.  Should we have more surveillance than we had when those FBI agents were knocking on the wrong doorat, uh, a level of surveillance that made possible the tremendous catastrophe we know as 9/11, or should we continue with the path weve been following since 9/11, toward, not a police state, not a nightmare regime in which you have no privacy.   Is anyone in this room as a concrete matter afraid to speak his or her mind?  I very much doubt it.  But, um  [LAUGHTER]  Thats just because your listeners are so cranky.  [LAUGHTER]  Uhwe, we are here  Uh, we are here to upholda new level of surveillance, that is, uh, that is not made up of new techniques, it is made up of very familiar and traditional techniques, as my partners will argue, that is not onerous, that is not burdensome, that leaves all legitimate freedoms and privacies intact, and that is abundantly worth it, and in fact has proven over the past half- decade, has proven in the acid test of experience its merit.   You know, 9/11 is beginning to be a little while ago.  But the recent terrible events ofat Virginia Tech, um, Technical institutethe, the Virginia Tech University, remind us, remind us of the reality of danger and fear, uh, ofthat we all experienced in those terrible days.   Now if we cast our minds back, back to that time, I think many of us will remember, we expected more of the same. We dreaded more of the same.  And that was one of the reasons that, uh, thethe sniper attacks in Washington were able to paralyze a great city.   Because we were ready for something dreadful, something even more dreadful.  And on American soil, it has not happened.  But that does not mean that the threat is not real, in fact, if you sound the roll of world events since 9/11, you will be reminded how very, very real it is.  In December of 2001, gunmen attacked the Indian parliament, and, uh, attempted well, hoped, hoped to kill in fact very senior officials in the Indian government.   They did kill a number of parliamentarians and some ciuh, civil servants, and some security guards, and very nearly succeeded in triggering a nuclear war, between India and Pakistan.   We remember the bombing in Bali, uh, whiwhich took so many lives of, uh, Indonesians and Australians, and others who were, who were visiting that, that beautiful place.  The Madrid Atocha railway station bombings.  The bombings in London in 2005.   Just this past year in 2006, attempted bombings, very serious attempted bombings, in Toronto, and in Germany, and tragically a successful bombing in Bombay, successful of course from the point of view of the terrorists.   Thesethe, the threat, the threat of mass-casualty terrorism, um, at the hands of people guided by a totalitarian ideology, remains a real threat.  But heres the good news.  What we notice as we look back on this half-decade of terrible atrocities, is a dwindling level of sophistication, behind each of these attacks.   Uh, that the Atocha attack was much less sophisticated than the 9/11 attack, the London attack in 2005, less sophisticated than Atocha, and the attacks attempted this past summer were less sophisticated than those of 2005.   The terrorists are finding it harder to coordinate, theyre finding it harder to communicate with each other, they are under crushing international pressure.  Nowone of the ironies about this is, we dontentirely understand how this is happening, even inside our own law enforcement agencies.   Heres one way to think about how a terrorist attack proceeds.  If anyif any of you have been in a toy store recently Im sure youve seen those toys, where you drop a ball bearing, uh, through, uh, into a little slot and it whizzes and rolls and it catches the little teeter-totter and it goes through a basketball hoop, and it proceeds over many, uh, feet of track until finally it emerges out the other end.   And there are a series all along the way of little switching points, and thats the game, to watch the ball jump and hop and skip and move past these various obstacles.  Think of a terrorist plot as like that ball bearing.  It starts, and it rolls and it unfurls.  And it has to pass', 'pass through a number of switching points.  If you can make each of those points just slightly more difficult, you stop the plot in just the way the earths atmosphere stops the meteorites, without any of us ever being aware of it.   It is that level of inof inof intensified surveillance of illegitimate activities, that has complicated the life of the terrorist, notand has not made terrorism impossible, has not in any way lessened their desire to do people harm, but that has madethat has broken up their ability to communicate with one another, that has made it more difficult for them to move money, and has made it much more difficult to strike, and especially to strike inside the United States.   You know, all of us here, are peopleare, um, are people who love liberty.  Who prize liberty, and who use liberty, as we are using it tonight.  But we are also citizens of great cities in the Western world.   And we are all potential casualties of attack.  And the liberties we are using are the very thing, the very thing that inflames and provokes those who would attack us.', 'We are here', 'to defend that liberty, by defending the higher level of surveillance seen since 9/11.  Thank you', 'May I have oneone sentence?  I mean I wantbecause I think what BobBob Barr said is very important, notice he said hes for enhanced foreign surveillance.

Do I feel that there are thingthat there are secrets that are important to me, that are more in danger of exposure now than they were before.   And then I ask you to consider, how many terrorist attacks have there been on US soil since 9/11, and what is the terrible record, through the 1990s, from the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993, to theto the attack in 2001.   Uh, I want you also to notice how radical their claim is.  We are not debating that better limitless surveillance, better surveillance at the sole discretion of the President, better lawless surveillance.  What we are saying is, better the higher level of surveillance that has prevailed since 9/11, than this risk.  Better, more.   They havethey haveuh, they, their argument, iscompleteis, is not modulated, it is not balanced, it is to say that, nothing, there is to be, there is to be no more.  I sometimes think, as I, as Ive been listening to this argument, what would they have said, had they been present at the introduction of the stop sign.   They wouldve looked at it and said, this is the first step on the slippery slope toward the total abolition of motion.  [LAUGHTER]  No one will ever be able to go anywhere ever again.  Umuhthe, thewhat we are debating here, is more and less.   We are debating balance.  Um, I think that, when we identify, as we surely will, specific problems and abuses that have appeared since 9/11, they ought to be fixed.  Of course they ought to be fixed, and that is why this original Patriot Act was sunsetted, that is why, uh, Congress, uh, has oversight powers, of course theythose things must be addressed.   But whatwe must do this with an understanding of danger.  We must ask ourselves, when we look back at that world before 9/11, when people', 'the same agency were not even allowed to talk to each other about what they knew.  Is that what we wanna return to?', 'Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Thank you very much.  Um, pleasure to be here this evening. My, uh, FBI story is a little bit different from Davids.  Its more along the lines of what the FBI was up against.  My brother, who lived in the Bronx, was applying for a job with the FBI, uh, and the knock we got on the door was from one of the neighbors who told him that the Feds had been by, but not to worry  he didnt tell em nothing.  [LAUGHTER]  Um, that, of course, was back in the 1990s, uh, before there ever was a, uh, George W. Bush Administration to bash.  Uh, and during that time the United States managed to stop exactly one terrorist attack by something other than dumb luck.  That was the spring 1993 Jihadist conspiracy against New York City landmarks, right here in Manhattan.  How did we stop it?  The FBI had a confidential informant who infiltrated the conspiracy.  Now, think for a moment about how intrusive that is.  Our government sent a man right out into radical mosques to meet with worshipers. All of them were Muslims.  Several of them were American citizens.  He prayed among them, he entered their very homes, he tape recorded all of his conversations.  And following the governments instructions, he lied to them about who he was and who he was working for.  And he did that precisely to trick them, uh, in order to get them to compromise their most deeply held secrets and plans.  And you know what?  Neither the Fifth Amendment nor the Fourth Amendment had a thing to say about it.  Its been the law of the United States for decades that such investigative techniques do not implicate our privacy and due process interests.  Um, as a result of that there were no court orders for those tactics, no judicial supervision, uh, no supervision of any kind for the most intrusive tactics imaginable. And had those tactics not been used, thousands of New Yorkers would have lost their lives in those attacks.  Thats not me conjuring up a nightmare scenario.  Thats not me trying to tap into your fear.  Thats a case that actually happened, right down here in Manhattan.  Uh, its the kind of investigating that didnt happen before 9/11, when nearly three thousand people were killed, and didnt happen in connection with most of the completed atrocities that were the subjects of the trials that took place in the 1990s.  And the Executive Branch, without judicial supervision and without much Congressional oversight to speak of, has intercepted and electronically eavesdropped on enemy communications in every war in the history of the United States since its been technologically possible to do so. Its a simple fact.  You cannot get good actionable intelligence, the intelligence that saves lives, without monitoring what people are saying to each other and without watching the bad guys to see who they speak to so that you can map out these organizations.  Thats just common sense.  The most dangerous conspirators are generally speaking the most insulated conspirators.  It takes wiretapping to ferret them out.  In the 1930s, uh, the government got Al Capone on tax evasion.  Thats all they could come up with.  Uh, but in the 1990s the government got John Gotti on about twenty-five homicides.  How did they do it?  They listened to what he was saying.  They bugged his conversations.  Today, of course, were not talking about Mafia hits.  Were talking about mass murders of our citizens  not just law enforcement but national security.  All of our liberties are precious.  On that, uh, I think every panelist here is in agreement, as David said before. But none of our liberties is worthy of the name unless we can secure the country.  And all our liberties are valuable but none of them is as valuable as the collective right to life that belongs to all of us collectively together in our national community.  To protect that right we have to do surveillance.  Were fighting an enemy that does not have a territory to defend.  It does not have a treasure that we can destroy them by taking.  Our only, only defense is surveillance  finding out who they are, trying to figure out what they might strike next.  And stopping them is far more important than prosecuting them.  Prosecutions become cold comfort when the death tolls start to climb into the hundreds and the thousands.  And weve seen that.  Thats not a scare tactic. Against such daunting risks privacy interests fretted over by our friends on the other side are frankly trifles. What difference does it make if the government has information that your phone company, your bank and every private, uh, vendor that you deal with, uh, not only has but is warehousing and data mining, targeting you.  Uh, but unlike the government, not targeting you so that they can protect you.  The governments ability to access such information may make the difference between life and death.  And in the national security context, that access is now subject to various judicial hurdles and Congressional oversight, which our law has never imposed on prosecutors and agents who investigate such insignificant, relatively speaking, crimes as gambling.  Common sense tells us that under the current threat this is the kind of investigating that government not only should be able to do but must be able to do. If you dont think so, ask yourself about the security you willingly subjected yourself to without any court search warrant the last time you got on a plane or entered a public building or tried to carry a bag into Yankee Stadium or even if youve had the experience of entering the offices of the American Civil Liberties Union.  We had a trial here in New York about a year ago and it came out during the trial that visitors to the ACLUs New York office, uh, are confronted when they come in with big signs on the wall that say, Your bags are subject to search.   Why do they do that?  Its a reasonable balancing of our minor, of minor intrusions to protect ourselves and the people we care about. Thats what the Fourth Amendment has always been about  reasonableness.  If theres a valid basis to believe people could be drinking and driving the police can set up sobriety checks and stop motorists randomly.  When the police arrest somebody, theyve always had the ability, uh, to search them to make sure that theyre not armed. If you work in a regulated industry the government can compel you to provide information and even do spot checks.  None of this requires a judicial warrant, none of it requires probable cause and there are thousands of searches like this, countless searches, taking place in this country every day, uh, and this has been the case for years and years without any discernable, uh, suggestion that the Constitution has been shredded or that our core freedoms have been jeopardized.  The thing all the exceptions Im talking about have in common, besides being reasonable restraints on our freedom, is that none of them is nearly as important as protecting our national security  the safety of us all collectively.  Weve done a lot of talking about civil liberties these last six years.', 'But the conversations I remember the best, uh, are the ones that I had with, uh, victims of terrorist attacks, like the World Trade Center attack or, uh, the two hundred, uh, mostly Muslim Kenyans and, and the people in the surrounding area, uh, who in Nairobi.  The threat were facing is not hype.  Its, its flesh and blood real.  And the fundamental rights of these victims  the vithe right to life, the right to liberty, the right to pursue happiness  have been stolen from them by our enemies in a way that can never be compensated.  Those are our most essential civil liberties and the only way we can protect them is by enduring comparative trifles in order to let the government do the thing that we needed to do, the only thing we really needed to do  uh, which is protect us and save lives.   And thats why you should vote for the motion.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Well, of course it should becausethe purpose of the power is to prevent attacks, and as long as the threat of attack exists, it would make no sense to get rid of the power.', 'Its a threat-time power, its an asymmetric war, uh, fought by a terrorist threat, and these measures are designed, uh, as much to thwart the threat as they are to prevail in the ultimate war.', 'Theres as many law enforcement', 'Therestheres as many law enforcement officers who disagree with that as disas disagree with it.', 'And your flat statement that the Fourth Amendment requires individualized suspicion is just wrong.', 'Nadine is again demonstrating the difference between a law enforcement mind-set and a criminal justice mind-set.  Uh, if you wait until you have probable cause that someone is an agent of a foreign power, you have waited too long.   Uh, and that may be what the, the standard is in the criminal justice system, that may be whats appropriate in the criminal justice system, but the Fourth Amendment has never required that, what the Fourth Amendment requires, is that searches be reasonable.   And if our goal is going to be to stop terrorist acts, rather than to bring people to justice, that has to be the standard that we deal with, and we have to do with an intelligence mind-set, which is far different from the criminal mind-set, when the FBI investigates a crime, they expect to bat about .900.   They expect that most of the time when they conduct an investigation theyre gonna get their man, uh, and theyre gonna successfully prosecute him. Intelligence doesnt work that way.  If you hit one for 15, youre probably doing well.   But its chasing the needle in the haystack that intelligence is about, and if youre gonna apply criminal justice standards to that task, youre finished because', 'you cant prevent anything', 'Well, wait', 'Its the law of the United States, its long been the law of the United States that if agents are searching for a legitimate reason, if they have lawful reason to be searching what theyre searching, uh, you can use the evidence even if its not what they were looking for in the first place.   Now Im not saying that its not a the possibility of a reasonable compromise.  But the suggestion that its an unreasonable position not to wanna negotiate that is, is, isI, I just have to disagree with that.', 'With due respect to the other side, what youre hearing is radical. Um, we now have increased surveillance.  Weve had it since 9/11, I dont think its sweepingly increased surveillance, but its certainly increased surveillance beyond what we had in the 1990s.  What theyre telling you, is better another 9/11 than increased surveillance.   Now, this is New York.  Ask yourself, what have you been going through for the last five years, six years, um, whether its keeping you up at night that, uh, the government is, uh, uhfrittering away with, with your personal information or whatever else is that, uh, that is the grave concern here.  And ask you, ask yourself, if thats anything like what 9/11 was like.  And whether in a million years, you would ever, ever wanna go through anything like that again, uh, if you could instead, uh, deal with the kinds of, uh, trade-offs between liberty and security that weve had in the last six years.   Thats not even a contest.  And to say that it is, thats about as radical as anything I can imagine.  Now one of the, one of the, last thing Id like to address is, this idea of perfect security and, and, risk of error.  Investigation whether its law enforcement or, or, uh, national security, is a human process, and we are not going to be able to repeal human error.   There are going to continue to be errors, there are gonna continue to be, uh, roguish acts by people who are rogues.  Rogues are gonna be rogues, no matter what the rules are.  When you change the rules, when you, when you, uhclamp down on what your agents are able to do, what youre actually clamping down on, are the good-faith people who you didnt need to worry about in the first place.   Um, these powers are in place because theyre needed, uh, to ferret out potential threats, because there is no perfect security, we can linewe can wire the whole place up with cameras and, uh, and bugs and the like', 'but we cant prevent every attack.']\n",
      "['Id like to thank the, uh, Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared for giving me the opportunity to escape the Peoples Republic of Berkeley [LAUGHTER]  and to visit a more conservative city, like New York.  [LAUGHTER]  I, uh, understand that many of you, according to The Washington Post, are here on dates.  I think this is a wonderful idea.  Uh, uh, I, uh, its really remarkable to me cause the last date I had was in the first Reagan Administration.  [LAUGHTER]  I do have to say, though, I find it surprising that many people would think that the voice and appearance of Bob Barr would be an aphrodisiac. [LAUGHTER]   First, let me, uh, directly engage with Jeffs point. If there are things that the government can do to increase security without reducing privacy we should have already done them.  I think at some point, though -- and I think were at that point now  you reach a trade-off.  Its not unusual to security policy.  Every government decision involves a tradeoff. When we decide to reduce greenhouse gases by having higher mile per gallons, uh, requirements for cars, we know a certain higher number of people will die on the highways because the cars will be lighter.  Government decisions always involve tradeoffs and its possible to have tradeoffs that go the wrong way.  We have had periods where civil liberties were greater than they are today and we have suffered as a result.  So, for example, the wall that many of you may have heard about, which prohibited the FBI and the CIA from pooling their information about terrorist networks is the one thing that the 9/11 Commission found that directly led to the 9/11 attacks.  Because we knew the names of two of the 9/11 hijackers inside the country, the agents who worked for the intelligence bureaus were unable to communicate that information to FBI agents inside the country who could tried to locate them because of rules that were set up to protect civil liberties. Similarly, when we have tried to put Al Qaeda members on trial before 9/11 -- and Mr. McCarthy was one of the prosecutors who did that  again, for civil liberties reasons, we turned over massive amounts of information to the defense teams.  One of those was a list of all the co-conspirators of one of the Al Qaeda suspects.  If you think about it that was a list of every single person at the time we thought was a member of Al Qaeda.  That list was found in Africa after the bombings in Yemen, when our agents went out to try to find out who was responsible.  Im not saying that we should go all the way over to security or all the way for civil liberties but there is a balance.  And there is a tradeoff.  And having more civil liberties can have a cost of security, just as increasing security can have a reduction in civil liberties.  Also let me admit that in past wars the government has reduced civil liberties.  But I would say, if you place it in historical perspective those reductions of civil liberties are far greater than anything were experiencing today. In 1798, the first war we fought as a country, it was made a crime to criticize the government during the war.  In the Civil War, President Lincoln, on his own authority, detained thousands of American citizens in military detention without any recourse to civilian court and had many of them tried by military judges.  In World War I it was made a crime and people were prosecuted for criticizing the war effort, for arguing that people should not obey the draft.  In World War II President Roosevelt detained over a hundred and twenty thousand loyal American citizens.  He initiated military courts, some of who, which were used to try American citizens.  He ordered the warrantless wiretapping  not just of communications going in and out of the country, but every communication inside the United States  against a clear statute and Supreme Court precedent at the time, over a year and a half before Pearl Harbor. I think, if you compare those measures that have been taken in wartime in American history in the past, the reductions of civil liberties we have today are nowhere near as large of a magnitude. Take, for example, the political system.  We have had two Presidential election  well, one Presidential election during, uh, this post-9/11 period.  We have had several Congressional elections.  Political control of Congress just switched in the last election.  We have had outpourings of new political speech through new methods and means.  For example, uh, people I wish never existed  bloggers.  This did not exist before 9/11. Are we really in such a serious civil liberties crisis if bloggers are able to use this new medium to say, uh, I think, quite incredible things? Take the detention policy that Im sure, uh, the other side is going to talk about.  These are always slippery slope arguments. How many American citizens have actually been detained since 9/11 in military detention?   Its not the thousands or hundreds of thousands from previous wars.  By my count, its two.  How many citizens of other countries in the United States  permanent resident aliens  have been detained as part of the post-9/11 program?   Again, its not thousands and not hundred thousands.  I think, again, that number is two.  Take the NSA Surveillance Program that weve all heard about.  Again, this is a program that every President in war has used -- sometimes without judicial supervision, often without Congressional authorization, often without the knowledge of anybody  in order to gain information on pending attacks.  So when you try to take into account these factors  the gains of security, which I think weve had and a loss of civil liberties  how should you think about this problem? Let me make  just close by making just a few points.  First, have the expanses expansions in government power been worth it?  I would say, Yes, look at the results.  There have been no attacks since 9/11.  And its not because of luck.  I think as even the 9/11 Commission Report, the Silverman-Robb Report have, uh, said, as the administration and members of Congress have said  these expanded surveillance powers have resulted in the capture or prevent, capture of Al Qaeda members inside the United States and the prevention of plots.  Since 9/11 the United States has succeeded in capturing or killing two-thirds of Al Qaedas leadership at the time of 9/11.  Again, thats not just through luck.   Second point:  Are civil liberties being permanently reduced?  I think many thoughtful people would say, Yes, theres a tradeoff, but I would be worried if we reduce civil liberties in wartime in a way that once the war is over civil liberties are permanently reduced. There is no way for me to tell you whats going to happen once this war is over.  But if you look at past American history wartime has not produced a significant permanent reduction in civil liberties.  Actually, if you look at the historical record, after war we usually as a society experience our greatest growth in civil liberties.  The Civil War saw the passage of the Reconstruction Amendments and ', 'the Emancipation Proclamation.  World War II was followed by the Warren Court.  The last point:  complacency, I think, is the real enemy.  Even having this debate is a show, a sign of the confidence we have that our system is working.  But we should be aware that were fighting a different kind of enemy, a non- nation state that conceals its activities as normal civilian communications, as normal civilian travel.  The hard thing is how, as a society do we fight that, fight a war against an enemy who is not following the rules of war and tries to disguise itself as one of us.  Ill close by saying I think so far we have made a successful balance between civil liberties and security.  We have reduced attacks and threats on the country.  I think those gains have been worth it.  And the question is, I think, for all of us today, is whether we would feel comfortable reducing the amount of government powers and by doing so, give up some of the security weve bought at such a, I think, dear price since 9/11. Thank you.', 'Chris, can  I just wanna take issue with the underlying premise of your question and, and Bobs response which is theres no reason to think the war on terrorism is going to be endless.  Uh, there have been many wars between nation-states and terrorists before, and they have ended.   Uh, thereve been wars in, uh, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, with terrorists, and they have all come to an end.  I think the problem is that we call it the war on terrorism so we think were at war with everyone who uses terrorism as a tactic, which is not the case, we are at war with the Al Qaeda terrorist organization, and organizations that help it.  And when we defeat that organization the war will come to an end.', 'The opposite of', 'The opposite of more is less.', 'First of all, I think its a great question because, under the current law within the United States, as Jeff said, you need to have probable cause that someones a terrorist before you can slap a wiretap on em, and it shows a fundamental confusion between how we think of terrorism.   I think the other side thinks of it as a crime, and as best handled through the standard criminal justice system which is this probable cause approach. Makes a lotta sense when as a society, we are willing to accept the harms of terrorism and retrospectively, after it occurs, then try to use a law enforcement system.   What 9/11 showed us is that, our government is trying to act prospectively to stop terrorist attacks before they occur.  And in order to do that we cannot rely on a system which says, prove to me that this person is already a terrorist because of criminal actions they have already engaged in,  because at that point, usually, as we saw in 9/11, they are already dead, and theres no one to hold responsible in the criminal justice system', 'Therethere are two things going on here.  First of all, with the Patriot Act, which is not the focus of your question, [UNCLEAR] focus of your question.  There is a system of secret courts and secret evidence that issues secret warrants for secret wiretaps. That system was created was created in 1978.  The Patriot Act amended some of those provisions, but the basic structure is one that weve been happy to live with, for almost 30 years.   And so, this claim that the Patriot Act was this huge revolution I think is, is mistaken.  The second thing I would say is, in terms of the ability of the President to go beyond the Patriot Act, thats based on history, as I said.   Every Presidentand as Andrew said, every President from Woodrow Wilson on, used exactly those same authorities, when confronted by a foreign attack or foreign threat, were not arguing here for unfettered power, were not arguing that these powers ought to be used in peacetime, were not arguing that these powers ought to be used to catch common criminals.   ImI actually personally dont think any evidence from those, uh, surveillance programs should be entered into court in any kind of criminal prosecution', 'They are there, to try to prevent a future attack.  And it seems and this is really Davids key point.  It seems weird, right?  If youre outside the United States and youre a terrorist, the NSA has unlimited ability to trackyou dont have to go to court and get a warrant, to Oto surveil Osama bin Laden,  if Osama bin Laden were to move to the United States, then, a whole system of court-ordered procedures are required under the other sides framework.  That is a perverse', 'and exactly reverse incentive', 'to one we should be creating', 'Im not defending Ashcroft', 'uh, today  [LAUGHTER]', 'II did, but it wasnt pleasant', 'And I certainly would never have been promoted, to speechwriter. [LAUGHTER]', 'I dont think itsthe NSA wiretapping program has not been used to prosecute garden-variety criI mean I could be', 'See, thatthats what Im trying to make clear that', 'Most of you, I thought you all just said the Patriot Act was something, most of which you supported, some of which you didnt, but I thought we were talking about the NSA wiretapping program where there is a very clear distinction about what that evidence can be sought for and its not to be used for criminal prosecutions and as far as I know, has yet toit never has been used for criminal prosecutions', 'Well, um, first I wanna apologize for the lack of rhetorical skills on at least my part, that should not prevent you from voting for our side in the debate.  Ive just admired the rhetorical gifts of everyone else on the panel, and thatfrom what I can tell that consists of calling the other side radical and exaggerating what they actually wanna do in the real world.   Um, clearly Im not an expert at this, I did not get the note about the dark suit, [LAUGHTER]  which is really the only thing I noticed listening to everybodys discussion.  Uhtwo things, one is I think the other side fundamentally confuses war versus crime.   Ask yourself this.  If the Soviet Union had carried out the 9/11 attacks in exactly the same way, exactly same people, would we not be at war?  And would we not be justified in using wartime measures to try to stop Al Qaeda from carrying out a second attack.  Why does the fact that they are not a nation-state require us to go back to criminal justice in the pre-9/11 world?  The second thing Ill just say is, its an empirical question whether the, the security of our country has gone up in response to the increased surveillance measures, I think it has.   Theres the person who wanted to blowblow upblow up the Brooklyn Bridge, theres too many Bs there, so Im not good at this.  The guy who wanted to blowblow up the Brooklyn Bridge was caught only because of these new measures.   The guy who wanted to carry out terrorist attacks in Florida and Southeast Ameruh, the United States who fled the country.  He was only identified, and an alert went out only because he was identified using expanded surveillance techniques.   So theres still more we can do.  One thing I would like to do asend as we began.  I think the FBIs utterly incompetent, its because, they try to do drug-dealing, white-collar crime which Im sure is of interest to many of you in New York, [LAUGHTER]  and all kinds of other things, and counter-terrorism.   The reason we keep them all together is out of civil-liberty concerns, I would say lets get rid of the FBI, create a real national security counter-terrorist agency [APPLAUSE], and let the states and the plothe states control drug crimes, white- collar crimes, and get the FBI out of the job of trying to do bank robberies and kidnappings.   I think that makes no sense.  Thats an improvement we can make, but would require you to vote for our side.  [LAUGHTER]', 'Just the white one.  Buy the white one.  [LAUGHTER]']\n",

      "[\"The microphone goes up.  [LAUGHTER]  Before I begin I want to just say one brief thing about what Richard has just told you. Hes, hes giving you the story of plate tectonics but its fascinating.  Hes turned it upside down.  Hes turned it on its head.  The story of plate tectonics actually is the story of one person who had the right idea  Alfred Wegener.  He had it in 1912.  And it is the story of major scientists at Harvard and elsewhere opposing him for decade after decade until finally it was proven to be incorrect what they were believing.  So it is, in fact -- when I was a kid I was told the continents didnt move.  It is, in fact, perfectly possible for the consensus of scientists to be wrong and it is, in fact, perfectly possible for small numbers of people to be in opposition and they will be ultimately be proven true.  [APPLAUSE]  I want to address the issue of crisis in a somewhat different way.  Does it really matter if we have a crisis at all?  I mean, havent we actually raised temperatures so much that we, as stewards of the planet, have to act?  These are the questions that friends of mine ask as they are getting on board their private jets to fly to their second and third homes. [LAUGHTER]  And I would like, with their permission, to take the question just a little bit more seriously.  I myself, uh, just a few years ago, held the kinds of views that I, uh, expect most of you in this room hold.  Thats to say, I had a very conventional view about the environment.  I thought it was going to hell.  I thought human beings were responsible and I thought we had to do something about it.  I hadnt actually looked at any environmental issues in detail but I have that general view.  And so in 2000, when I read an article that suggested that the evidence for global warming might not be quite as firm as people said, I immediately dismissed it.  Not believe in global warming? Thats ridiculous.  How could you have such an idea?  Are you going to try and tell me that the planet isnt getting warmer?  I know its getting warmer.  I grew up in Long Island.  And when I was a kid we always had days off from school for hurricanes. There are no hurricanes on Long Island now.  I spent thirty years in California.  We used to have something called June gloom. Now its more like May, June, July, August gloom with September, October, November gloom added in.  The weather is very different.  However, because I look for trouble, um, I went at a certain point and started looking at the temperature records. And I was very surprised at what I found.  The first thing that I discovered, which Dick has already told you, is that the increase in temperatures so far over the last hundred years, is on the order of six-tenths of a degree Celsius, about a degree Fahrenheit.  I hadnt really thought, when we talked about global warming, about how much global warming really was taking place.  The second thing I discovered was that everything is a concern about the future and the future is defined by models. The models tell us that human beings are the cause of the warming, that human beings, uh, producing all this CO2, are whats actually driving the climate warming that were seeing now.  But I was interested to see that the models, as far as I could tell, were not really reliable.  That is to say, that past estimates have proven incorrect.  Uh, in 1988, when James Hanson talked to the Congress and said that global warming had finally arrived, The New York Times published a model result that suggested that in the next hundred years there would be twelve degrees Celsius increase.  A few years later the increase was estimated to be six degrees, then four degrees.  The most recent U.N. estimate is three degrees.  Will it continue to go down?  I expect so.  And this left me in a kind of a funny position.  But let me first be clear about exactly what Im saying.  Is the globe warming?  Yes.  Is the greenhouse effect real?  Yes.  Is carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, being increased by men?  Yes.  Would we expect this warming to have an effect?  Yes.  Do human beings in general effect the climate?  Yes.  But none of that answers the core question of whether or not carbon dioxide is the contemporary driver for the warming were seeing.  And as far as I could tell scientists had, had postulated that but they hadnt demonstrated it.  So Im kinda stranded here.  Ive got half a degree of warming, models that I dont think are reliable.  And what, how am I going to think about the future?  I reasoned in this way:  if were going to have one degree increase, maybe if, if, climate doesnt change and if, uh, and if theres no change in technology  but of course, if you dont imagine there will be a change in technology in the next hundred years youre a very unusual person.  And I also was aware that we have actually been starting to do exactly the kind of thing that we ought to do, which is to decarbonize.  Jesse Ausubel at Rockefeller University points out, for example, that starting about a hundred and fifty years ago, in the time of Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria, we began to move from wood to coal, from coal to oil, from oil to natural gas and so on.  Decreasing our carbon, increasing our hydrogen makes perfect sense, makes environmental sense, makes political sense, makes geopolitical sense.  And well continue to do it without any legislation, without any, anything forcing us to do it, as nothing forced us to get off horses.  Well, if this is the situation, I suddenly think about my friends, you know, getting on their private jets.  And I think, well, you know, maybe they have the right idea.  Maybe all that we have to do is mouth a few platitudes, show a good, you know, expression of concern on our faces, buy a Prius, drive it around for a while and give it to the maid, attend a few fundraisers and youre done. Because, actually, all anybody really wants to do is talk about it. They dont actually do anything.  [SOMEONE CHUCKLES IN BACKGROUND]  And the evidence for that is the number of major leaders in climate who clearly have no intention of changing their lifestyle, reducing their own consumption or getting off private jets themselves.  If theyre not willing to do it why should anybody else?  [APPLAUSE]  Is talking enough?  I mean, is, is -- the talking cure of the environment, it didnt work in psychology.  It wont work in the environment either. [LAUGHTER]  Is that enough to do?  I dont think so.  I think its totally inadequate. Everyday 30,000 people on this planet die of the diseases of poverty. There are, a third of the planet doesnt have electricity. We have a billion people with no clean water, we have half a billion people going to bed hungry every night. Do we care about this? It seems that we dont. It seems that we would rather look a hundred years into the future than pay attention to whats going on now. I think that's unacceptable. I think thats really a disgrace.\", \"This doesnt need to happen. Were allowing it to happen. And I dont know whats wrong with the rich self-centered societies that we live in in the west that we are not paying attention to the conditions of the wider world. And it does seem to me that if we use arguments about the environment to turn our back on the sick and the dying of our shared world, and that's our excuse to ignore them, then we have done a true and terrible thing. And its awful, thank you. [APPLAUSE]\", 'Ititsthis is always to me a very fascinating point.  If, if we were to say, um, does the moon revolve around the earth, uh, we would say yes, and no one would ever, would ever preface that by saying, well, the consensus of scientists says this.  You know, the, the notion of consensus is only a vote for very particular kinds of things, and to me its a serious warning signal.   For example, ordinarily if I were to say the moon is full of green cheese, no one would, no one would vilify me or they would take me out and prove to me that that wasnt the case.  Its, its when there isnt a very good and powerful counter-argument, thats the first answer, the second answer is, is one I really like very much and its one Einstein made.   He, umthere was a the Nazis decided that they would, uh, do something to demonstrate that German science was bad and they got 200, uh, German scientists to say that Einstein was wrong and then somebody asked Einstein, how does it feel to have 200 scientists against you.  And he said, it takes only one to prove me wrong.', 'No, I was', 'what am I saying again', 'Im not saying that the consensus is necessarily wrong, Im only saying that consensus is not aa clear proof that its right.', 'No ANDREW REVKIN As a hedge MICHAEL CRICHTON no, I dont think anybody objects, uh, the, the, the question is whether or not youre gonna spend what Bjorn Lomberg thinks which is $558 trillion and I think, if in fact its going to prove to be that kind of enormous construction project, then that should not be the first priority right this minute.  But no, I dont', 'You know, uh, Im really fascinated at the number of newspaper headlines and articles that I see about global poverty and the, and the difficulties of people in Africa as compared to the headlines about, about global warming, and, um, uh, of course Richard its very true that we can do two things at the same time, itthe, the reality is that we dont.  And the reality is, that, we are failing and have continuously failed to address the issues of the third world even though, everyone knows that if you were to, to look at it for bangs for the buck, if you were to look at it from a humanitarian standpoint, if you were to look at it from the easiest way to do the most for environmental degradation as its created around the world, you would address global poverty.  But were not.   Were talking as were talking tonight, were all getting very heated about something that may or may not happen 100 years from now.  And while were doing, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000 people are dead.', 'There was a time when I worked in a clinic and, uh, one day a young woman came in, she was in her early twenties for a routine checkup and, I said whats going on with you and she said Ive just become blind.  And, I said, oh my gosh, really, when did it happen, she said, well just, uh, coming into the clinic, walking up the steps of the clinic I became blind.  And I said, oh, and Imby now Im looking through the chart and I said, well, has this happened before, she said yes, its happened before.   Ive become blind in the past, and, what she had of course was hysterical blindness.  And the characteristic of that, is that, the severity of the symptom is not matched by the emotional response thats, thats being presented.   Most people would be screaming about that but she was very calm, oh yes, Im blind again.  And Im reminded of that whenever I hear, that were facing, whether we wanna call it a crisis or not, a significant global event, of, of, of importance where were gonna have species lost and so on and so forth', 'that we can really address this by changing our light bulbs.  Or that we can really make an impact by unplugging our appliances when were not using them.  Its very much out of whack.  And so ifif it were only gonna do symbolic actions, I would like to suggest a few symbolic actions that rightmight really mean something.   One of them, which is very simple, 99% of the American population doesnt care, is ban private jets.  Nobody needs to fly in them, ban them now.   And, and in addition, [APPLAUSE]  lets have the NRDC, the, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace make it a rule that all of their, all of their members, cannot fly on private jets, they must get their houses off the grid, they must live in the way that theyre telling everyone else to live. And if they wont do that, why should we.  And why should we take them seriously.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Okay, Id like to thank Intelligence Squared, the staff, Bob Rosenkranz, Brian Lehrer and of course, our worthy opponents, for the opportunity to debate the proposition:  Global warming is not a crisis.  Please keep in mind what the proposition is.  It is not a debate over whether the earth has been warming over the past century.  Uh, the earth is always warming or cooling, at least a few tenths of a degree.  And were talking about, so far, something on the order of six tenths of a degree centigrade. Were not even arguing about whether greenhouse gas emissions are contributing at some level to warming.  And they most certainly should or I would suggest it would be very little. Indeed, as far as I can tell, even our opponents do not claim that global warming is a crisis at present.  Rather, we are primarily addressing the future.  Now, much of the current alarm, I would suggest, is based on ignorance of what is normal for weather and climate.  Extreme weather events occur all the time.  Theres, there is really no evidence of systematic increases, judging from reports from bodies ranging from the National Hurricane Center to the U.N.s Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change.  In fact, outside the tropics the theory of such storms and variability says that the variability should decrease in a warmer world. Thus, if this is a matter of crisis for where we live the world is in a permanent state of crisis and will be less prone to crisis in a warmer world.  Sea level has also been a matter of concern, I think largely because its very telegenic, as opposed to a half degree of temperature.  And sea level has been increasing since the end of the last Ice Age glaciation, with the most rapid change increase about twelve thousand years ago.  In recent centuries the rate has been relatively uniform, averaged over ten year periods.  Uh, it amounts to a couple of millimeters per year and this is residual of much larger positive and negative changes locally.  Uh, those changes are due to tectonics.  And, and the risk, if youre worried about sea level change, from these changes is larger than it is from warming.  The impact of warming on agriculture is not easy to ascertain.  But, for example, India has warmed in the second half of the twentieth century and agricultural output has increased greatly.  The impact on disease seems dubious at best, according to articles in Lancet.  Infectious diseases like malaria are not so much a matter of temperature as of poverty and public health, most notably the elimination of DDT.  Malaria is still endemic in Siberia and was once so in Michigan.  Exposure, I would suggest, to cold is generally found to be both more dangerous and less comfortable.  Now, recently the IPCC summary for policy maker came out and it had an iconic claim about mans impact on temperature change.  Uh, does this imply crisis?  Well, the impact on temperature per unit carbon dioxide actually goes down, not up, with increasing CO2. Uh, the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gases is not directly related to the emissions rate or even CO2 levels, which is what the legislation is hitting on, but rather to the impact of these gases on the greenhouse effect.  Uh, modelers use double CO2 as a convenient benchmark and on the basis of current models, its claimed that this should lead to about one and a half to four and a half degrees warming.  What is less often noted is in terms of greenhouse forcing were already three quarters of the way to that doubling.  And weve only seen point six degrees.  And theres no reason to suppose, furthermore, that this is all due to man.  Now, this certainly does not support the model forecasts upon which alarm is based.  Modelers commonly claim its still possible that aerosols have canceled much of the greenhouse warming. Unfortunately, the impact of aerosols is considered by the IPCC to be virtually unknown.  And indeed, many people consider that canceling the warming involves a larger effect than seems plausible.  There have also been claims that warming has been delayed by the ocean.  But the results Ive mentioned are from coupled models involving the atmosphere in the ocean.  And in many of these the oceans have been tuned to have particularly long delays.  And I think its crucial to distinguish between the claim that models can display past behavior from the actual situation, which is that models can be adjusted to display past behavior once that behavior is known.  There is no reason to suppose that the adjustment corrected the relevant error.  It is worth adding that warming, instead of accelerating, has been essentially absent for about the last ten years.  So the iconic statement is itself not indicative of crisis.  And one could, if one had time, explain why the iconic statement itself may very well not be true.  The major defense of the statement is modelers cannot think of anything else that gave warming over the last thirty years.  But these are the same models that cannot account for the Medieval warm period, or for that matter, even do a good job of replicating El Nino.  So even the basis for the iconic statement is not particularly meaningful.  So crisis is not a product of current observations.', 'I suggest its not even a product of projections.  Now, there is no reason to suppose that anything will cause a threshold to change this assessment.  Were still talking about a two per cent imbalance and were also talking about the impact of CO2 per unit CO2 that decreases.  This is not the usual condition for a threshold.  Moreover, there are positive reasons to suspect that greenhouse warming is not significant.  The real signature of greenhouse warming is not surface temperature but temperature in the middle of the troposphere, about five kilometers.  And that is going up even slower than the temperature at the surface. Finally, the underlying present concern is not the greenhouse effect, per se.  Doubling CO2 by itself only gives you one degree warming.  The --', '[OVERLAP]  Okay.', 'Yeah, of course it could be.  [LAUGHS]  Thats, uh, goes without question.  Theres no reason to assume were at the optimum for climate.  Its been all over the place', 'It may be', 'What I was referring to was the issue of variability.  And that depends basically on the pole-to-equator temperature difference. And since the models are suggesting that the warming would be greater at the poles, then you are reducing the equator to pole- temperature difference, youre increasing thedecreasing the forcing for storms, and youre decreasing the range.', 'But, can Ican I answer that?', 'Yeah.  But, you know, the claim of consensus right now is also not based on a voteor anything else, and in fact it was invoked by Newsweek in 1988when they stated all scientists agree.', 'Actually, I do not disagree with Richard on that.', 'I think it is true that the media amplified what was going on considerably, and that the field itself was in a much healthier state at that time and the open discussions were greater.', 'And moreover, Michael', 'has made the point', 'Lamont made the same statement, you dont use consensus if you have a proof.', 'Explain that', 'Youll forgive me, Gavin  [APPLAUSE]  Ifif you seriously wish to maintain that, then youd better explain why', 'between you and Richard, youve made statements that are overtly untrue.  And Ill give you some.  You say, the earth has been warmeris warmer now than it has been for 1300 years. The national academy evaluating this said, the methodology was no use beyond 400 years.   Why do you make this statement. You keep on quoting these groups, and when they disagree with them, you make up the quote.', 'No, they did not', 'No, the', 'front endthe front end said', 'No, Im saying the text, said it was not credible beyond 400 years', 'He didnt say that', 'That is controversial', 'and its controversial because it is not a homogeneous distribution of water vapor.', 'And, you know, to pretend this is settled, is bizarre.  Moreover with clouds, which are comparably important, you know full well, that that is not settled.', 'By a long shot.', 'Yeah.', 'Yes.  I think its a little bit difficult to know how to respond, to be told that, uh, one shouldnt attack scientists while youre attacking scientists, to go and say you have to control methane without explaining that methane has stopped growing.   You dont explain why theres global warming on Mars, Jupiter, Triton and Pluto.  You dont look at the ocean data and see, that whereas your boss Jim Hansen was saying that the heating of the ocean proved the flux that he needed for high sensitivity, that in the last year thereve been two papers in the same journal, that point out that the original Levitus datas wrong, that the ocean is cool, and that the new numbers would call for one-tenth the sensitivity that Hansen mentioned.   If all this is so certain,  why is the data changing, or is it a case when the data changes you ignore it, and', 'stick to the point.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "[\"Brian may I just take one second to thank very much the Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared for having the great courtesy to invite me over from London to participate in this very exciting set of debates. Thank you also to all my colleagues for their contribution and above all to the audience for Im sure, gonna be exciting participation as well. I want to start exactly with the consensus word that was used by Richard. Can I just remind you he wanted an example. In the early 20th century, 95% of scientists believe in eugenics. [LAUGHTER] Science does not progress by consensus, it progresses by falsification and by what we call paradigm shifts. And in my, riposte [UNCLEAR] Ill be coming to a paradigm shift that could actually throw the whole of what that other side is saying through the window. But that's later. [LAUGHTER] What I want to come to now is the 1970s that Robert Rosenkranz quite correctly reminded us of. Because then a crisis was announced. And I want to quote from three newspapers. The Christian Science Monitor, Warning, Earths climate is changing faster than even experts expect. I really like that. Your own New York Times, A major cooling of the climate is widely inevitable. And in Newsweek, back to consensus, Meteorologists are almost unanimous that catastrophic famines will result from global cooling. That was the 1970s. And there are many headlines. And what I would like to stress is, it was a stress on consensus, it was faster than expected, the evidence came from the oceans, from polar bears, its always polar bears, from the changing seasons and its always disaster. Why do we believe them now? And what is important in this I think is to remember what that first Earth Day claimed. The first Earth Day in America claimed the following, that because of global cooling, the population of America would have collapsed to 22 million by the year 2000. And of the average calorie intake of the average American would be wait for this, 2,400 calories, would good it were. [LAUGHTER] Its nonsense and very dangerous. And what we have fundamentally forgotten is simple primary school science. Climate always changes. It is always as Dick said warming or cooling, its never stable. And if it were stable it would actually be interesting scientifically because it would be the first time for four and a half billion years. [LAUGHTER] Second, humans have been influencing climate for a million years as hominids, from the first hominid that set fire to the Savanna grasslands in Africa, when particulates and gases started to rise and they changed the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth. Its a long relationship. So the debate, is climate changing and are humans affecting climate change is actually nearly irrelevant. The answers are yes and yes, and always will be. What is really crucial in all this is something that none of the scientists or none of the politicians want you really to hear. Climate is the most complex system we know governed by thousands of factors, I havent time to list them. But the point is, its like in my country, Glasgow on a Saturday night, chaos. [LAUGHTER] And what were trying to do is manage it by dealing with one pub. One. And it just wont work, thats the danger. In such a system, doing something at the margins and not doing something in the margins are equally unpredictable. And the question we should be asking our politicians are, what climate are you actually aiming to produce and when we get there wont it change anyway? The crisis is therefore in ourselves and if we are rejecting this and I ask you passionately to do so for the next two more important reasons, our uh, political agenda as Michael hinted is wrong. There are two great crises in the world of which the biggest unquestionably is four billion people in poverty. And this topic is an ecocondria of our rich selves, London, New York and Washington. Its about us and about our hypochondria about the world. If you actually have clean water, you have modern energy, you will cope with change whatever it is, hot, wet, cold or dry. Im a left wing critic of global warming because the agenda is fundamentally wrong and dangerous. And believe you me, neither Republican nor Democrat will do anything about it, because our second crisis is a crisis of hypocrisy. Now Michael hinted at this, but I come from Europe which has been lecturing the world on this subject. Let me tell you, the hypocrisy in Europe is absolutely mind blowing, I am embarrassed. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] The latest statistic from the Environment Agency in Europe will predict under the Kyoto Protocol we wont even be minus, that by 2012, well be plus four percent. And did you know that island whom we all love actually under the Kyoto Protocol is allowed a growth of 13%? And some of the figures for the, for Europe are just spectacularly worrying. Spain, Italy, Portugal, were in the 40 percentile. And yet we lecture the world. What we see in this is an enormous danger for politicians in terms of their hypocrisy. Im not going to say anything about Al Gore and his house. [LAUGHTER] But it is a very serious point. Global warming is also dangerous because I am an environmentalist, but what Im beginning to see is that global warming is setting age-, agendas which are actually damaging for the environment. Bio fuels in which the energy relationships are very dodgy, but which have a very significant effect certainly in my country on biodiversity. What is more, were having wind farms placed for global warming on very, very sensitive peatmoor habitats. Dont think therefore that if youre an environmentalist, you have to be attached to this agenda. Because it is now overarching, overdominant and is actually taking money and effort away from genuine and real on the ground habitat[OVERLAP]\", '..environmental concerns. But let me end with two images. Angela Merkel the German chancellor, my own good prime minister for whom I voted let me emphasize, arguing in public two weeks ago as to who in Annie get the gun style could produce the best temperature.  I could do two degrees C said Angela, No, I could only do three said Tony. [LAUGHTER] Stand back a minute, those are politicians, telling you that they can control climate to a degree Celsius. This is a political crisis, not a crisis as put here, and I ask you passionately to vote against it. And Samuel Johnson and James Thurber, I have to end with Thurber because of the New Yorker. Samuel Johnson, the great lexicographer talked of a, in Russia last talked to an astronomer who thought he could control the sun and the clouds.[OVERLAP]', '.he was mad.', 'I cant get Thurber in, thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Look', 'But theyd have less water source', 'Just to say I did find Gavins comment a little amusing because in fact 8,000 years ago, at a peak of warming much higher than today, you know  what the climate people call it?  The climate optimum.  In other words its actually perceived as more optimal in terms of vegetation and other factors.', 'But I think that raises a really interesting issue because of course adaptation to change is always the way that humans have coped with it, in fact of course bad planning and bad building doesnt excuse and is not proof of global warming.', 'Yeah, whats very amusing was, one scientist came out in 1970, a Swedish scientist, and actually said we should pump out carbon dioxide to ensure that we didnt go into global cooling. [LAUGHTER]', 'Of course not, no', 'Whats very important', 'Yeah, quite, Gavin right, you said, we should always be at the edge, the edge of science on climate change has nothing to do with CO2, its to do with what we call cosmic rays, the relationship to the sun, and water vapor.', 'I didnt say that.', 'Simply because there are a whole range of scientists who are working on this particular topic and they say its one of the big unknowns and a great deal of research has just been done on it. At the edge', 'The most famous', 'But the most famous astrophysicist working on it say that it has.', 'Thats a serious accusation against some very serious scisome are infinitely better than any of us on this platform today.', 'There are some very eminent scientists, Professor Jan Veizer for example, uh, uh, Nir ShProfessor Nir Shaviv who won the Young Scientist of the Year in Israel two years ago, who are in fact arguing that 70% of, of climate change is primarily driven by cosmic rays working through water vapor and clouds.   Im not saying theyre right or wrong, theyre pointing however at the edge, to new research.  You cannot dismiss that, because its a consensus for CO2.', 'Im left-wing and have no money whatsoever from any oil company', 'and I wouldnt.', 'But I know', '[INAUDIBLE] has interests.', 'I could not agree more.  Yes, its governed by the atmosphere. Absolutely, and is not under our control.', 'It is therefore one of the big factors, that we have no control over.', 'In a non-linear couple system.', 'I saidI said control.', 'Well you cant predict', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, exactly.', 'I dont disagree with it. ANDREW REVKIN Okay, you did ityeah, so, we allI love to find the things we agree on.  Um, so everyone agrees, more greenhouse gases will make the world warmer.  Uh, the doubling is, is a step on the staircase werewere heading on toward tripling or quadrupling, I think everyone would mostly agree that if we go to nine billion people, all of whom would love to have our level of affluence, were going in that direction.   And so, as a hedging exercise, if it werent costly to slow the pace, beyond the Jesse Ausubel very slow [LAUGHS] decarbonization, if we could find a new way that didnt cost a lot, that actually could give energy for those developing countries that crave it, and limit emissions at the same time, would anyone on the pro side think that its a bad idea to stop emitting greenhouse gases, if there were a solution.', 'Well', 'The real problem is', 'theres no social discounting in this, lets get a bit of economics in.  So in fact, if youif you have an increase now, and you take inflation into account, what youre doing is an average world, um, income at the moment of $7,500.   Predicted by aa distance ahead, that will rise to about $88,000, you knock off what in fact the Stern Report in Britain estimated, as in fact the cost of global warming, 13.27 or so percent, it comes down to something like, uh, 70-something thousand dollars but even taking inflation account [sic],  that is still a massive increase in wealth so what youre actually asking in economic terms, is what is strange but a poorer generation to sacrifice a great deal for what will in any case, even with global warming cares, be a wealthier generation.', 'Yeah, it was a, I think a brilliant question that, because the earth is as tough as an old boot.  If there is any fragility its in us and thats what were concerned about, the earth will survive whether were here or not or whether theres global warming or not', 'Very briefly, but its a very important point, the point is very simple, that humans are not just doing CO2, we do many factors, and the way we have altered the albedo as we call it, the surface reflectivity of the earth, uh, particularly I may add since the Neolithic revolution in agriculture has had probably quite a significant effect.   However, we cant model it very well.  And the problem is its one of those big gaps like many others things in the models that were talkingand that is a human factor.  So in other words I agree with that, exactly how we cope with it though is another issue, because we know so little about it.   And can I remind everybody that IPCC that we keep talking about, very honestly admits that we know very little about 80% of the factors behind climate change.', 'Dont dismiss it', 'Well lets use an engineer, I dont think Id want to cross Brooklyn Bridge if it were built by an engineer who only understood 80% of the forces on that bridge.  [LAUGHTER]', 'May I say that the last thing I want to do is to demean any scientist.  The whole point about science is that it is a constant debate.  And actually, what has worried me deeply about this is not the demeaning of scientists but the attempt to close down the debate, and actually take it away from science.  [APPLAUSE]   If I may use a musical analogy, my other great interest, trying to reconstruct the climates of the moment as were talking about is a bit like trying to play Mozarts wonderful Symphonia Concertante 364, when youve no viola part and only a quarter of the violin part.   In other words we know remarkably little about so much of the climate that, that we are facing.  And, what I would like to stress is, itits a debate on the crisis.  Weve mentioned the crisis of poverty, and I think the crisis of hypocrisy.  Actually where I think we probably agree entirely as a panel, what there really is in the world, theres not a crisis of climate, a crisis of energy.   That is certainly true in my country. And Ill tell you what worries me particularly about attaching it to climate.', 'In the world, there are groups, including some very reputable groups in Denmark and in Russia and in other countries, which are predicting actually that we will enter a global cooling phase between 2012 and 2015.  Now, I no more necessarily believe that than I do about the global warming.   But just supposing that happens, and just supposing what the public reaction is to the hype that there has been about global warming, I actually think that we have to face up to a genuine energy issue in the world, and that most of our politicians are not doing that, in fact theyre dressing it up in this idea of global warming and saving the world, and what we desperately need are very practical decisions about energy, on the ground.   And I think the idea of using the climate to do this is potentially a very dangerous one.  So, what I am worried about is that everybody is now using the global con global warming construction for their own agendas.  From capitalist carbon trading, right the way to making you wear hemp underpants.  [LAUGHTER]  I distrust that because in the end', 'its an ism', 'and I distrust isms.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",

      "[\"Now that Pew Poll that uh, was cited by Robin, uh, I have to say has some statistical problems because in terms of France, Germany, and Britain, they over-sampled the Muslim population, sampling them at levels close to fifty percent.  And that accounts a great, for a great deal of the change.  When considering this motion, whether you're going to support it, the real question is whether the America that you see in the generic Hollywood that constitutes television shows and movies and music, is the same America that we all live in and work in.  I mean what if your only glimpse of the United States was the latest report of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton and their boycott of underpants?  Um in nations around the globe, there are lots of people who have never been to the United States.  Now Richard Walter has traveled the world and he said he was privileged to do so, but theres lots of people that have not.  And theyve never come here, theyve never met you.  And so their only impression is the export of the pop culture by the Hollywood community. And that includes all of this product.  It includes television, and music, and movies.  Uh, an appearance on The View by Danny DeVito.  And once upon a time, as Richard Walter alluded to talking about the thirties and forties in Hollywood, theres a nickname for this, its called a Golden Age.  Its for a reason because iconic images were sent around the world, images of Henry Fonda, images of Clark Gable, images of John Wayne.  And the world fell in love with America, and they fell in love with those Hollywood images.  And there was a, a set of values.  There was optimism and there was courage.  And there was unshakable belief in freedom, and unshakable belief in fairness.  To, to show you how much it shifted um, in the period, is it, John Wayne who was made into the symbol of America by director John Ford, the cowboy was rugged and independent and gallant and true.  We move forward to 1969 when the first film that was X-rated wins the best picture.  Uses the name cowboy, its Midnight Cowboy. And here the cowboys profession is relegated to that of a male prostitute.  The cowboys uh, follow in the long way.  But things continued in what Roger Kimball called the cultural anti- Americanism.  Since the 1960s, that what people see around the world is an America of extreme violence, of rampant crime, of unapologetic narcissism, of licentious exhibitionism, and self- loathing.  And this is misshapen.  Its distorted.  Its a place where even Tony Soprano would run to his therapist.  And look at rap lyrics.  I mean rap lyricsnot all of it, but a lot of it, have themes of assaulting women, dealing drugs, killing the police.   In many caseswell, actually, almost all caseswomen are described either as female dogs, or garden utensils.  [LAUGHTER]  And theand the export of this pop culture has increased.  Um, multiplexes were built in Europe, and, uh, the, the exports have gone up to a level of 40to 50 percent of film box office, is on foreign shores.   That includes the films that my colleagues brought up, uh, Syriana and Michael Moores Fahrenheit 9/11 which has been very popular in the Afghan case.   Um, Americas recent film exports, though, took the idea of artistic license in relation to violent scenes to a whole new level.  We have a whole new genre of films that are doing big box office abroad, and they deal with nothing butsadistic, senseless, sickening torture.   Im talking about films like Hostel,  which did $33 million abroad, the Saw series, theres three of them, they did $160 million abroad. These films, Hostels plot is a group of young people who are traveling, who are taken prisoner by an organization that allows businessmen to torture and kill for entertainment.   Theres no plot.  And they lead our neighbors abroad to believe, that America is deviant, and despicable and violent.  Its no wonder that, we have, uh, heard this nickname of Israel as the little Satan by some of the people were fighting against, and they call us the great Satan.   As a matter of fact, uh, Robin referred to studiesthis isnt a poll but it certainly is an event when, right after 9/11 one month later, angry mobs went to the local cinemas, and burnt down five of them that contained American films.  I guess they gave it a thumbs-down.   The, uhthe, the other aspect of Hollywood thats very disturbing, is the way representatives of free enterprise are depicted.  Business people, executives, and corporations.  Um, you know, II would expect that in a town that, that writes scripts that every once in a while wed see, uh, a corporate executive as a villain.   But its almost always that way.  Oliver Stone made Wall Street, named his main character Gekko, and he extolled the virtues of greed.  In Syriana, as, umyou know, uh, my colleagues have brought up, which, by the way, George Clooney used the Charlize Theron formula to win an Oscar.  Thats you pack up thepack on the pounds and then pick up an Oscar.  And in, in that film, theres a business executive with a suit that explains anti-Americanism.  Explains the reason America is successful, he says, Corruption is why we win.   Hollywood hasnt even left their remakes alone.  When they remade The Fugitive, all of a sudden they have to have a pharmaceutical corporate as a co-conspirator with the one-armed man that was not in the original television show.   Uh, my colleague, uh, Josh brought up The Manchurian Candidate. Which inexplicably changed the villainous totalitarian government, into a corporation.  The Manchurian Corporation, what do they manufacture?\", 'So apparently in Hollywood wealth is taken for granted, its a zero-sum game, a finite pie, where if one person wins, then another loses.  Uh, last year, there was a remake of a famous American symbol.  Superman.  And Superman has always been associated with the phrase, Truth, justice, and the American way.   And if you went to the film, you noticed, there was no American way, or it was taken out.  And maybe thats because, Hollywood has manufactured a new American way that does not fit with either truth, or justice.  [APPLAUSE]', '[OVERLAP]  [UNCLEAR]  [UNCLEAR]that its not increasing numbers because you questioned whether we could debate the statistics.', '[OVERLAP]  The Pew poll, um, yeah, okay.  Good.  [LAUGHTER] The Pew poll sampled ', 'sampled, uh, nine hundred and two people in Great Britain. Four hundred and twelve of them were Muslim.  Nine hundred and five in France, four hundred were Muslim.', 'Nine hundred and two in Germany, four hundred and thirteen are Muslim.  That does not reflect the percentages of the populations in those countries.  That poll, that poll is statistically invalid.  [APPLAUSE]', '[OVERLAP]  Well, wait, wait, wait.  I, I want to get in on this, please.', 'Okay, good question.  I think its the degree of specialization that Hollywood has had in villainizing and demonizing the representatives of free enterprise.  And why, and why do I even talk about free enterprise?   Because America in the world represents the greatest experiment in free enterprise in the history of man.  I mean, Western civilization generally  and America specifically  is an aberration in human history.  And part of the whole class warfare concept, really, is to make success something that you should feel guilty for.  And you see this theme running through.  And it, and its, and it becomes more prevalent when Oliver Stone names a character after a lizard.  It becomes more prevalent when we have this series of movies where the plot line involves the evil corporation and the crusading worker or journalist, or single mother with a push-up bra.  It, it, its the same pattern but what it does is, it takes away from a great part of this country.  Instead of something that could be told which is sort of the entrepreneurial cowboys in this country, going back to the luminaries like Thomas Edison to national treasures like Steve Jobs.  Who creates prosperity around the world through innovation that is fostered by a system that didnt happen by accident.  I think that that, that is a significant and more subtle point of anti-Americanism though I, I say its not exclusive to the period after the decline of the studio system in the sixties.  But then again, Frank Capra also made films, a series of films called Why We Fight that were made specifically during a time of war to bolster our side and demoralize their side.  Instead today, as we brought up with Syriana and other films of that elk, films are being made to bolster their side  [OVERLAPPING VOICES] and to demoralize our side.', 'Um -', 'Yeah I mentioned uh, you know I, I live close to Los Angeles and I love Hollywood, but I love America more.  And uh, Ill tell you, Richard Dreyfuss, who used to speak differently about America until he went on a campaign to teach civics and he read some himself, has called this country a miracle.  And the innovations and advancements that weve had here were because of a system where for the very first time, rights and powers were viewed as implanted in individuals.  And some of those were transferred, pursuant to a social contract we call the Constitution, to a government.  That had never happened before.  Um this motion is, is about free speech.  And uh, to address an audience member who asked about responsibility today, the responsibility is greater for two reasons.  One is because of what Thomas Freedman calls the flat earth.  Because Hollywood exports more instantly, and two is because of the greater war.  We were attacked in the city, it was the greatest attack on continental soil in our history.  The greater war continues, even many of those who opposed the war in Iraq are still cognizant of the fact that there is a war on terror. The reason I, I had asked you to vote for the motion was simply to raise awareness that this output of pop culture coming out of Hollywood matters.  And its not only for our domestic consumption, its being consumed by the world, it shapes the way they view us.  And Hollywood ought to use its power to help America prosper.  I mean in that way, in the worlds eyes, theyd be a winner.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Good evening.  Id like to, uh, thank Mr. Weinraub and Bob Rosenkranz, uh, Dana and all the IQ staff, IQ2 staff, um, for organizing this event and keeping alive the tradition of civil discourse and debate in New York.  Um, its, its a tradition that is, uh, unfortunately, uh, fallen out of favor in recent years.  Um, now, contemplating the motion before us, that Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad, I have to admit that when I first contemplated this I thought of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbs.  Maybe some of you know this strip.  Im thinking in particular of that, that, uh, cartoon whose first frame shows the little Calvin  hes six years old, quite a demon  hammering, furiously, nails into a board.  And then in the second frame Calvins mother runs into the room, screaming, Calvin, what are you doing to the coffee table?  In the third frame, Calvin looks up with a look of extreme bemusement on his face, saying, Is that a trick question?  [AUDIENCE RESPONSE]  Now, we all know that Hollywood in its current incarnation, uh, boasts a, a large quotient of anti-Americanism.  Uh, the names Matt Damon, George Clooney, Alec Baldwin, Barbra Streisand, Michael Moore, Susan, Susan, Susan Sarandon  the, the list goes on and on. We also know that anti-Americanism is alive and well in the world today, alas.  Now, what is the connection?  I want to be clear about what the resolution before us  a resolution, by the way, that I, I hope you will support.  It is that Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad.  This is, this is where it gets tricky. This is not a referendum about the Bush Administration, the war in Iraq or any, uh, evils, real or supposed, of American society.  It is a resolution about the effect of Hollywood movies and the Hollywood mindset on this phenomenon of anti-Americanism abroad.  Now, the first thing to note is that anti-Americanism is what we might call a hearty perennial.  It does not need Hollywood to thrive.  It has a long pedigree, born of wealth and power.  One thinks of Pericles and what he had to say about, uh, the way in which distinction bred envy, envy bred resentment and resentment, if not checked, bred hatred.  Athens, in her day, was cordially hated.  Rome, in her day, was cordially hated.  So was the British Empire.  As the authors of that great satire, 1066 and All That, reminded, remind us, after the first World War America emerged as what they called top nation.  So it, it assumed the mantle of Great Britains, uh, pre-eminence and it also has passed the scepter, uh, as it were, of the worlds antipathy.  And that has been something thats been pretty constant from that time on.  There have been intervening moments of gratitude, after 1918, for example, after 1945, for example.  But basically then the world slips back into disliking us.  Um, so thats, thats no, uh, just a kind of common reality which we,  which we live with. Thats one form of anti-Americanism.  In our, in the current form, anti-Americanism, I think, was born domestically of the Sixties. Its a product in part of what the literary critic Lionel Trilling called the adversary culture of the intellectuals  um, fed by the Vietnam War, fed by the radicalism of the Sixties.  We all can remember the students demonstrating in the street, spelling America with a K and so on.  Um, something more radical happened abroad.  But this is not new either.  You go back to the Carter years.  There are plenty of people chanting in the streets, down with the great Satan, death to America, burning American flags.  Same thing in the Reagan administration, same thing in the Clinton administration.  The same thing in both Bush administrations.  Hoards shouting Death to America is always, seems always to be with us.  So anti-Americanism, domestic and foreign, is like a, a kind of rank garden.  It thrives.  Hollywood merely supplies a layer of what you might call fructified, fructified manure.  Anti-Americanism abroad would exist without Hollywood, just as cancer would exist without cigarette smoke. But Hollywood tends to make the malignancy worse.  And it does this I think in two ways.  One way is what we might call cultural anti-Americanism.  By making so many trashy, vacuous movies, Hollywood uh, fosters a view of American life that is really at odds with the reality of American society.  It um, shows this society to be largely sex-obsessed, violence-obsessed, a society shot through with cynicism about its founding institutions.  And by and large portrays a decadent society in love with nihilism.  Thats one way in which Hollywood fuels anti-Americanism abroad, by portraying America as a society that has lost its soul. Another way and perhaps a more virulent way, a more political way, is the way Hollywood, by attacking those institutions of American life uh, shows America to be a bankrupt, corrupt, venal, savage uh, mercenary society.  Um these, this side of Hollywood really sort of took off I think in the 1960s during the Vietnam War.  Is there a Vietnam film uh, that shows America as anything other than a horrible, savage, misguided society? Maybe one or two.  One thinks of the Hanoi Hilton but of course that was instantly savaged by critics.  Stanley Kaufman, for example, dismissed it as filth.  By and large I think any movie that deals with American society from the 1960s on deals with all of the institutions of American life as something not to be admired but to be disparaged.  When was the last time you saw the president of the United States in a movie portrayed in a favorable light, or the military?  Its very rare that this happens. Oliver Stone, I think summed up what, what Hollywood is like now when he says We have become the enemy.  Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad to such an extent that for example, German schoolteachers show Bowling for Columbine by Michael Moore as an accurate portrayal of American society.  One thinks, for example, of the movie Syriana which blends incomprehensibility with anti-American animists to an extraordinary extent.  Charles Krauthammer said that this movie could have been scripted by Osama Bin Laden and I believe that movies like this, that the general spirit of Hollywood today actively fuels anti-Americanism abroad.  And I hope that you will support that motion.  Thank you.  [APPLAUSE]', '[OVERLAP]   Josh did not say that. JOSHUA MURAVCHICK [OVERLAP]  Thats not true.  I mean, thats, thats nonsense.  I didnt say anything like that.', '[OVERLAP]  Yes, but that would assume that, that anti- Americanism is a new phenomenon.  Its not.  Weve had it   No.', '[OVERLAP]  Yes, I do.  I do.', '[OVERLAP]  Well, I, I, I can ', '[OVERLAP]  We dont.  Nobody says that.', 'And the, the short word is the 1960s.  I mean why is it that today you can never hear the word corporation?  This is now, its, its synonymous with evil.  And if you prefix the word corporation with multinational, it becomes kind of the, the epitome of all evil. Why is that?  I mean sure there were plenty of movies in the past that may have represented this or that businessman, this or that politician as corrupt or evil, but now its always the case.  I mean some of my colleagues mentioned movies that, where theyve changed the plot.  I mean, and Ill just mention one more, The Bourne Identity.  In the book, the bad guy was Carlos the Jackal. In the movie, its the CIA and this is consistent.  I mean its just every kind of thriller that you see these days uh, the United States government, the United States military, the United States commercial enterprise.  Its always presented as somehow corrupt, venal, savage.', 'Well I remember when I was in uh, high school.  My Jesuit teachers would drum various things into us.  And one saying they had was Never deny, seldom affirm, always distinguish.  It pains me to observe that the speakers against this motion tonight seem to be unable to appreciate that the motion does not say that Hollywood causes anti-Americanism.  It is not a referendum on the Bush administration or the war in Iraq.  It simply says that Hollywood fuels anti-Americanism abroad.  It seems to me that um, my team has supplied numerous examples of how this, how this happens.  And we could certainly spend the entire night providing examples.  One of the people on the opposing side remarked on the remarkable outpouring sympathy for the United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.  Well I, I would, and then its quick evaporation.  Um I would say that that outpouring of sympathy was basically a version of sentimentality lodged upon the United States in its you know, unusual posture as victim.  As soon as the United States began standing up for itself, that sympathy vanished.  And I think that tells us a lot about the world opinion and how we can depend upon it.  But in terms of Hollywood which is really a mindset, as James Hirsen said, its not just the movies.  Its really, were talking about a way of looking at the world, pop culture in general.  I think this is a mindset that has given up on America in many ways, given up on those traditional virtues.  James mentioned free enterprise but there are many other things.  Individual liberty, belief in the, in the future, really.  And ', 'Done?  I will finish then, or stop.  [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['[OVERLAP]  But Robin, youre scaring me.', 'Yeah, but there was a lot of anti ', 'Because, uh, the, the two, the two people in the audience, uh, nailed this point more, uh, most clearly.  It is, it is not a court case.  This is not a crime in which theres one victim and one perpetrator.  Were talking about attitudes in the world that involve, uh, hundreds of, of millions or billions of people.  And there are many causative factors.  And I dont know what it is about the word fueling that you dont understand.  But the question here is whether Hollywood is one of those factors.  And the very simple, uh, uh, you, answer to your effort to put this all on Iraq is that there was a lot of anti-Americanism in the world, uh, before the war in Iraq.  There was a lot of anti-Americanism in the world before Bush was elected President.  There was a Gallop poll, uh, of the Muslim world, taken, uh, a year before the war in Iraq, that  but after the war in Afghanistan, in which larger numbers of the respondents, uh, said they thought that, uh, that 9/11, the attack, the terrorist act of 9/11, was justified, than thought that our attack on the Al Qaeda and Taliban in Afghanistan, uh, was justified.  And you can go back, uh, uh, to the Nineties when we were discussing enlarging NATO and there was a huge, uh, uh, outpouring of, uh, of, uh, anti-Americanism in Europe, afraid that the perpetuation of, of, uh, of NATO would be, as the French Foreign Minister put it, a Trojan horse to, to keep the Americans in control, uh, of NATO.  This anti- Americanism comes from many reasons.  It comes from some policies that we may think are wrong or, or Iraq or what have you. It comes from other policies that fewer people, uh, in this room would disagree with, as this gentleman pointed out, uh, from our support for Israel.  Uh, I spend, uh, a lot of time in the Middle East.  And when you talk to Middle Easterners they have two grievances against America at this moment and the war in Iraq is number two.  Its our support for Israel thats, uh, thats number one.  And, uh, the, the issue of, uh, the fact is that were not going to be able to conduct ourselves in the world according to any policies without making some people angry, some people dislike us and so on.  The question that were talking about tonight is whether the fare that Michael Moore and Oliver Stone and, uh, the, the other, uh, uh, Hollywood opinion shapers are putting out to the world, uh, contributes to and compounds that.', '[OVERLAP]  No, I understand that it says that.  But look at the percentages.', 'But look at the percentages.', 'I want to answer that.  If every movie Ive mentioned was produced by a man, it just shows that women are not guilty for uh, for fueling anti-Americanism.']\n",

      "['Daniel Ayalon:', 'Steven Cook:', 'John OSullivan:']\n",
      "[\"Thank you very much.  Can you hear me?  Now start the clock now.  Good evening, thank you very much for being here.  With all due respect to my colleagues and my team, Steven Cook and John OSullivan who did a fantastic job, I must even thank more our adversaries, Stanley Cohen and Mahmoud, which did a great job actually convincing you I'm sure, to actually vote for the motion that Hamas is a terror organization.  Actually I will depart. Naively I thought that uh, they will relate to the nature of Hamas. What do they do?  What do they believe in?  What is their conduct?  But no, they actually opened the debate to a more geopolitical and historic um, issues which actually leave me on a much firmer ground.  So I will depart from the notes I prepared here and I will answer the, my esteemed colleagues here on the other side who talked about occupation, who talked about Israeli aggression, who talked about UN resolutions, and I will say something which is very, very simple.  Israel was attacked in 1967 by three countries around us, Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. The Occupation, quote-unquote as they call it, is this territory which was obtained by Israel as an act of self-defense.  These three countries and others were trying to push us into the sea and actually destroy Israel, destroy the Jewish people who came back to their historic land, to their Biblical land, to the place where they belong.  Now, the war happened in 1967.  Israel was created in 19-, or was recreated in 1948.  From 1948 to 1967, nineteen years, there was no occupation.  West Bank belonged to Jordan, Gaza belonged to uh, Egypt, nobody talked about occupation then.  Nobody talked about creating a Palestinian state.  ]  You know why?  Because they wanted to create this Palestinian state right where Israel is now today, killing all the Jews.  So from 1967 on, against her will, we had to defend ourselves and obtain possession of these territories.  But still, we always wanted peace.  The proof, 1977.  When we had a leader like Anwar Sadat of Egypt, and he signed a peace treaty with us and he renounced terror and violence and he recognized Israel, Israel withdrew entirely from the Sinai, having peace with Jordan now for more than thirty years, uh, with Egypt for more than thirty years.  1995, Jordan, King Hussein, a great leader, wanted to make peace.  We made peace.  We withdrew from some, all the land that we occupied from Jordan and there is a peace between Israel and Jordan, recognizing each other, respecting each other, and not shooting at each other.  In 1993, Israel, believing that the Palestinians really had a change of heart and they would like to make peace with us, we signed as the Oslo Accord.  And the Oslo Accord was a very simple view, land for peace.  Israel withdrawing from West Bank in Gaza, the Palestinians got a hold of themselves, stopped the terror, and becoming a responsible party. 2000, Camp David, former Prime Minister Barak meeting with uh, with Arafat to try and make peace.  Barak is offering to withdraw from the entire territories, but this was not accepted by Arafat. Not only was it not accepted, but after it was rejected, this intifada started.  Intifada is a misnomer, it was a very planned, pre-planned campaign of terror which cost more than a thousand Israeli lives, many children, devastation in our cities, and uh, continued rejection of the very notion of the right of Israel to exist in its home land.  Now people compare between Camp David 78 that succeeded with Saddam Hussein, with, with us with Sadat. I'm very tired, I came back from Israel not a few hours ago, between Sadat and Arafat, Camp David 2000.  What was the difference?  The difference was leadership.  Sadat wanted to make peace.  He prevailed over the advice of his advisors and signed a peace treaty.  Arafat also unfortunately prevailed over the advice of his advisors who said sign the peace treaty because you will not get a better deal.  And he was against it.  Now Hamas was against Arafat.  They did not even believe in any negotiations. They are against, and they were against Oslo, why?  Because they do not believe in Israels right to exist.  They do not believe in coexistence, they do not believe in peace.  They do not believe even, in a democracy.  Because they would like to have one Islamist Palestinian country a la Iran, Iran style and under the Sharia, the, the, the law of, of Islam.  So lets go back to the debate tonight. What is the definition of terror?  Killing intentionally of innocent people.  What does Hamas do?  Killing only, only children and innocent people.  They stand terrorists strapped in explosives into markets, into pizzerias, into coffee shops, and into school buses and kindergartens.  This is what they do.  Are they a terrorist organization?  If this is the definition of terror, they definitely are a terrorist organization. Secondly, do they believe in coexistence?  No, they deny Israels right to exist.  Now people here are talking about whether elected democratically or not, this is besides the point.  Just look into the Hamas, www.hamas.com in their website on the internet and look into the Hamas charter.  They believe in killing, they dont believe in Israel, they dont believe in any peace.  So are they a terror organization?  According to this definition, they are as well.  Now there is another issue here.  Who is Hamas operated by?  Are they really doing the will of the people?  I don't think so.  My esteemed colleague here on the other side, Stanley Cohen said he just returned from Damascus and he met Khaled Meshaal? Where did he meet Khaled Meshaal?  In Damascus.  Who is really operating Khaled Meshaal?  The Syrians, and the Iranians.  So theyre not really playing.  Theyre not really representing Palestinian authentic interest.  They are representing the interest of this crazy Islamist in Iran, and in Damascus.  Are they a terror organization?  I think yes, I think all of you should vote for this motion. Now there is this question whether they were democratically elected.  Well I would say a broad definition of democracy is you know, doing the will of the people but also observing the rule of law.  And the rule of law does not permit gangs to be brandishing their guns and going with bullets into the ballots.  Uh, dont take just the case of Hamas.  Look at what happens.  I mean we should apply this global world, global community, the same yardstick for everywhere.  There were elections held in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in the former Yugoslavia.  In all these elections, armed gangs were denied the right of voting and also of being elected.  The same case should have been with Hamas but for some reason, this thing was ignored and Hamas was allowed to run.  And I think this was a mistake.  Unfortunately, Hamas won but its not because the people voted for their ideology \", 'Its because it was a protest vote against Fatah which was corrupt and ineffective.  So this is the reason why Hamas was elected. Did it change their character?  Not at all.  Does a formal process change intrinsically what Hamas stand for?  Now after the elections, they still are killing.  There are more than a thousand rockets fired from Gaza into our towns, killing babies and children, and theres no reason for that since we left Gaza entirely.  We left Gaza entirely in order to give Palestinians a chance to show everybody that they can govern themselves responsibly.  That they can do away with terror and incitement and start negotiation with us.', 'Just vote for the motion.  [APPLAUSE]', 'Well I think this is, I think that this is really nonsense.  I think we are here talking, you know, in just slogans, democracy and first of all we have to remember, you know elections, democracy doesnt start with elections, it doesnt end with elections.  There is a culture, there is, there should be a rule of law, there should be a participation of all walks of life in a society.  Unfortunately we have a backwards situation in all the Muslim and Arab countries where there is no, basically there is no middle class.  There is only elite who really control all the resources, all the political power, all the economics, and everything else and all the others are poor, uneducated.  And they, and really they are subject to the incitement of the ideological zealots from Iran -', \"I'm talking about facts, I'm just talking about facts.  So what I, what I would answer to you is no, we should not promote democracy in the Middle East.  What we should promote is equal opportunities.  What we should promote is empowerment of women.  What we should p-, uh, promote is good education for the people so theres not these inequalities.  And when the people themselves will have a stake in their own lives, in their societies, they will decide what type of regime they do want.  [APPLAUSE]\", 'This has nothing to do with that and uh, irrelevant.', \"Let me just mention to you, you're mentioning \", 'No but this is very important Judy.', 'I think its important because they keep raising this issue of ', 'Being pharmacists and doctors.', 'And all that, let me tell you ', 'There are millions ', 'There are millions of engineers and doctors.', 'And professors and musicians in the thirties who voted for the Nazi party which brought on the Holocaust.', 'With doctors ', 'Professors ', 'And what they believe in, this is what should be the yardstick.', 'Not their diplomas.', 'Youll hear it pretty soon from me -', \"Can I, can I answer to that?  Well dont judge us and dont tell me what Israel will say for twenty more years.  Just judge us by our deeds.  When Egypt was ready to recognize Israel, we signed a peace treaty, the same with Jordan, the same with the PLO, and I take issue, I think its incorrect what you mentioned here.  Israel was ready to recognize the PLO and talk to them only and only after Yitzhak Rabin received a letter signed by Yasser Arafat, ninth of September, 93, which renounced terror, which recognized Israels right to exist, and which also promised to change this charter that you were talking about.  This is exactly what were expecting from Hamas.  And this is not just an Israeli expectation, this is a demand by the entire international community as was expressed by the quartet, the four parties that are responsible for the peace process in the Middle East.  Which called for the Hamas after they were elected, they said okay, you were elected, it doesnt matter if it was democratically or not, it doesnt matter if you're a terror organization, lets look and move forward.  And Israel is in that camp, lets look and move forward, not about what you did, the fact that you already fired Qassam rockets this morning, killing a baby in Sderot.  Lets look to the future and we still say, if you renounce terror, if you recognize Israels right to exist and you abolish your charter. And now also if you accept our previous agreements which were signed by the PLO, then you are a le-, legitimate parter, partner. But theyre not doing that because theyre still a terror organization, because they do not believe in coexistence and they do believe not in building a nation but destroying one, which is ours.  And we are not going to let them do that.  You're talking about, Stanley Cohen, about the right of return.  What kind of right of return?  Theres no right of return.  There are, there were Arabs there which we wanted to coexist with them, but they refused -\", 'Just read, just read the history, just read the history and then you will know, there is not such a thing as right of return.  There is a problem of the refugees, this is true.  There is a refugee problem, but the responsibility for the refugee problems lie on the heads of the leaders of the Palestinians and of the Arabs.', 'Indiscriminate firing at children ', 'Schools, theyre all ', 'Not at all.', \"Its the Hamas.  What you wouldn't know \", 'They are all terrorists and this is the difference.', 'Oh absolutely.', 'Let me tell you that ', 'Let me tell you that they are not ', 'Its not just the ten thousand there.', 'There are fifty thousand more.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'They are all ', 'They are all being trialed, they are all being processed. MAN Let me, let me  DANIEL AYALON And I wish the same chance was given to the Israeli kids that are being targeted by these guys.', 'Absolutely, this is exactly what we want.  We, we say stop the killing, stop the terror and we will sit and talk.', 'What we will talk about, what we will talk about?  The road map to peace.', \"Yes.   Thank you, well what was the issue today?  The issue was of little moral and practical nature.  Legally, are they law offenders?  They have illegal arms, they breached the law, yes, Hamas does.  Moral issue.  Are they killers of children and other innocent people, yes they are.  And of practical issue, just a matter of common sense, is there any sense talking to them?  Will talking to them bring peace and quiet?  Well I don't think so. Now we have to make sure the equation is right, and its not that they will say well we will stop killing you if you give us land, if you give us political concession.  This is not the equation.  If they stop killing us, we will stop hunting them.  When they are ready for political concessions, we will give them political concessions.  Its apple to apple, oranges to oranges.  This is the issue and so long as the Palestinians and Hamas especially, deny recognition of Israels right to be there in their homeland, theres not going to peace, to be peace.  And the fact that they continued with this uh, terror, and some would call it resistance is also a fallacy because its not resistance.  Israel is ready to uh, to build a Palestinian state.  Israel was withdrawing from territories, the entire area of Gaza, areas of the West Bank.  And we are willing to talk.  What, what are we going to talk about?  The road map to peace, how to make peace, how to create a Palestinian state which will live side by side with a Jewish Israel.  This is at stake now, and so long as the Palestinians do not want to do that, as long as they keep the killing, theres nothing to talk about.  They stop the killing, then we talk.  [APPLAUSE]\"]\n",

Despite electoral success, Hamas is still a terrorist organization.  What is there really to debate here?  What does participation in an election have to do with Hamas' profile as a terrorist organization?   I am quite sure that my colleagues on the other side of the debate will tell you that the Palestinian elections were the truest, freest and fairest in the Arab world.  That's an absolutely true statement.  They're also going to tell you that the outcome  reflected the will of the Palestinian people.  That's an absolutely false statement.  And three, they're gonna tell you that Hamas provides critical social services to Palestinians in need.  That is, my friends, totally irrelevant to tonight's subject.  These arguments amount to little more than an analytical slight of hand.  An organization can participate in a free and fair election.  It can provide social services and be a terrorist organization.   There is no seriously scholarly work out there that indicates that any of these activities are mutually exclusive.  Despite what Bob Rosenkranz said in his eloquent remarks to open this evening's events, it is not an intellectual position to suggest that Hamas is no longer a terrorist organization.  It's an ideological position. It's ideological.  Rather than an analytical conclusion based on the available evidence, let's consider a few things.  I'll leave it to my colleagues to describe for you the number of innocents who have been killed at the hands of Hamas.  But it's important to provide some historical context here.  To the evolution of Hamas.  Hamas' very founding in the late 1980's was based on an imperative of violence. In the late 1980's, members of the Palestine branch of the Muslim Brotherhood grew concerned that another organization called Islamic Jihad was taking prestige and influence away from them because Islamic Jihad was engaged in violence.  Their solution to this political problem was the establishment of Hamas.  They would continue the Islamization of Palestinian society from below through the provision of social services, in keeping with the historic mission of the Muslim Brotherhood.  But they also established a military wing.  A military wing that was dedicated to terrorist acts against Israelis in an effort to burnish their nationalist image and out-maneuver Islamic Jihad.  The founding covenant of Hamas which has not changed is explicit in its mission to elaborate all of historical Palestine through a variety of tactics including violence.  The result has been the bloody carnage of the streets of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Ashkelon and numerous other Israeli cities.  My critics will say this is old news.  Hamas has evolved. It's become a political organization.  This as Mahmoud Mohamedou said is a historic opportunity.  But my question is has Hamas really evolved?  It still denies Israel's right to exist.  None of its leaders have renounced the right to armed struggle.  The only thing has changed is a tactical change.  It has sought to harness the elections that the United States has pushed on the Palestinians to advance its agenda.  And what is that agenda?  The establishment of a Palestinian state in all of historic Palestine with sharia Islamic law at its core.  Well what about a cease fire? My critics will tell you there's been a cease fire since 2003.  Be careful about the words that people use when talking about a cease fire.  Hamas calls it a hudna.  My colleague Mahmoud Mohamedou calls it tahdiya.  Well in fact both of those, both of those have a temporary quality to them.  Anyone who speaks Arabic should know that a hudna has a finite period of time.  It's not much of a cease fire anyway.  Since the Israelis withdrew from the Gaza Strip they've been victim of rocket assaults on their towns, the kidnapping of their soldiers and threats to their major cities.  Under the weight of available evidence and I have a little bit of uh a little bit of this just before.  Stanley and I were standing around before, talking about what we did agree on.  The Giants, the Yankees, the Knicks and the desultory state of our teams.  And then we got into talking about Hamas and I said sure, they wouldn't be a terrorist organization, they just have to lay down their arms.  And he said you're right the Israelis have to lay down their arms.  That's not the point.  It's cute, it's funny but it's not the point.  Under the weight of available evidence, supporters of Hamas tend to shift their argument to focus on Israeli behavior.  And I should point out a case in point was Judy Woodruff's extraordinary interview with former President Carter last night on the NewsHour.  It is true, Israel has expropriated land and continues to illegally settle the West Bank.  Israel has killed Palestinian civilians.  Though unlike Hamas not intentionally.  It has worked assiduously to undermine Mahmoud Abbas and before him Yasser Arafat.  All this is very, very true. But it neither alters the fact that Hamas is a terrorist organization.  Nor absolves Hamas of the bloody responsibility for its own behavior.  If the issue was Israel's contributed to an environment where extremist ideologies, alienation and terrorism can thrive, there would be little to debate.  But this is not the subject we're examining here this evening.  Participation in elections  Hamas' participation in the Palestinian elections is analytically irrelevant of whether it is a terrorist organization or not.  It is a group that remains dedicated to Israel's destruction and in the process of that destruction, the inevitable killing of innocents.  For Hamas to no longer be considered a terrorist organization it must change its charter.  It must renounce its violence and it must lay down its arms.  At that point and only at that point can it be seen as a legitimate participant in the political arena.  With that I urge you, I urge you to vote with the proposition that a democratically elected Hamas is and remains a terrorist organization.  Thank you very much.  [APPLAUSE]\", 'Can I just add something to that Judy?', \"On this question of the United States only liking the people that gets elected, and you mentioned the issue of Egypt and since I'm writing a book about Egypt, I, I, I feel compelled to respond. Theres not a single Egyptian official, nor is there a single American government official who believes who has, that the United States is no longer pressing the Egyptians on democratic reform.  Its just not true.  In fact I was in Cairo in September, and at the same time that the United States government presented papers to the Egyptian government that included benchmarks for democratic change.  And that is even with eighty- eight members of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Egyptian Parliament.  The difference between the Muslim Brotherhood in Hamas is that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has not engaged in an act of violence since at least the 1970s.  You cant say the same thing about Hamas.  Well thats terrific, they havent \", 'Hold it, Stanley.', 'No, no, no, no, come on Stanley.', 'We clearly know -', 'We clearly know whos controlling Egypt.', 'Its certainly not the Muslim Brotherhood.', 'But they did ', 'You know -', 'Actually you know this.', 'You have absolutely no understanding of what the US government is doing right now to promote democracy in the Middle East.', 'This is all very entertaining -', 'Stanley, chill out, youll get an opportunity.', \"Just because you're a pharmacist \", \"Doesnt mean you're not a terrorist.\", 'Osama Bin Laden is a civil engineer, come on.', 'Lawyers, pharmacists.', \"Ill go for it, thank you very much.  Um, I think that theres really no condition.  The pothole theory of politics, that somehow Hamas, which is dedicated to a broader, ideological agenda, is someone going to have to pick up the garbage, that that is going to moderate their view of the world.  That certainly didnt happen with the PLO once it returned to Gaza, I don't expect it will happen with Hamas.  Now of course the question of bomb, of the King David Hotel, everybody trucks that out as, as evidence of terrorism, the fact that the, the Israeli, Israelis before, in the pre- state era engaged in terrorism.  My understanding of the bombing of the King David Hotel was that it was not directed specifically against innocent civilians, but it was against British occupation, authorities.  That is not consistent with the definition of terrorism. INTERVIEWER Alright.  Uh, thank \", \"Its amazing, isnt it?  Everything I told you would happen, happened.  Our interlocutors on the other side did not address the issue at hand, they shifted to Israeli behavior.  But I want to respond to some specific things that each of them said to demonstrate how weak their arguments are.  And since Stanley impugned my credibility and my expertise, Ill return the favor. Stanley spoke passionately ponytail waving, arms in the air, doing the whole hippie thing, talking about many or most in the world believe.  Come on Stanley, I got my Ph.D. because, I didnt need to go to law school because I'm the son of a lawyer. You should know every first year law student knows that when you argue many in the world, most in the world, most people believe, its a logical fallacy.  Just because most people believe it doesnt make it true.  What is Mahmoud talking about when he talks about protorecognition?  Is that like being half pregnant? You cant be half pregnant, you either recognize or you dont.  I had, throughout the 1990s, I spent my time parsing the words of Palestinian leaders, do they or do they not recognize, what is protorecognition?  Hudna means somehow recognition, but hudnas in.  I don't understand it.  The majority of the Palestinians did not vote for Hamas.  Forty-four percent of the people voted for Hamas.  Now I'm sure the people on the other side of the room would say that George Bush was not democratically elected because the majority of Americans didnt vote for him in 2000.  Well I would apply the same principle to Hamas.  I'm shocked, I'm actually shocked that Mark Perrys interlocutor is Osama \", 'Oh Ill skip that part.  Ill just say, Ill just say that it is extraordinary that Mark Perry gave all the evidence you needed to vote for the proposition.  He said his Hamas interlocutor said that they would not give up violence because its a bargaining chip.', 'So thus the lives of innocents is a bargaining chip, its a political power player on the part of Hamas.  They will continue their terrorism, thank you.  I urge you to vote For.  Oh youve already voted, so thanks for your vote.']\n",
      "[\"Madam Chairperson, ladies and gentlemen.  Uh well thank you for that kind introduction before Ms. Woodruff.  And um and I want to share in the general uh agreement of the panel here that we're grateful for the organizers of this event of which there ought to be many more.  Uh in order to stimulate genuinely interesting debate. I um I will begin by going straight to the topic.  Because anyone who deals with terrorism has to be begin, and I was asked to do this by the last speaker, with its definition.  I think  you must also scotch the old canard that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.  My own definition has the distinction of having been adopted by the Court of Appeals in Canada.  If I may quote, Mister Justice Neland, quoting me in the case of Canada versus Najoub in October, 2001, the court spoke as follows  a terrorist is a man who murders indiscriminately, distinguishing neither between civilian and innocent and guilty nor soldier and civilian.  He may employ terrorism  planting bombs in restaurants, hijacking planes, in a bad cause or a good one.  He may be a Nazi terrorist or an anti-Nazi terrorist.  A Communist or an anti-Communist.  Pro Palestinian or pro-Israel. We may want to defeat his political cause or to see it triumph. For his methods however a terrorist is always to be condemned. Indeed to describe him objectively is to condemn him.  Even if his cause is genuinely a fight for freedom with which we sympathize. Unquote, unquote.  [LAUGHTER] Now we are asked today to consider whether organizations that use terrorist methods as describe above should also be admitted into the arena of conventional politics and in particular to the arena of conventional democratic politics.  The motion cites Hamas.  But Hamas is not the only organization that combines seeking power through elections with terrorism.  Hezbollah does the same.  So does the Eta linked Batasuna party in the Basque region of Spain.  So does the two headed Sinn Fein IRA in Northern Ireland.  Nor are these organizations shy about their deeds.  They openly boast of employing terrorism even if they sometimes quibble at the word.  Sinn Fein for example has said clearly that it sought power through the Armalite rifle and the ballot box. These four parties Ive mentioned have enjoyed varying degrees of success.  They all raise the same question.  If a democratically elected group employs terrorist methods, should it be regarded as having run itself out democratic politics and should we refuse, refuse to deal with it.  Ideally I maintain that they should be run out of politics and that we should refuse to deal with them. Indeed I would go further.  When we deal with such bodies, as if they are conventional parties, we are making murder respectable. We are in fact inciting people to murder.  First because we are saying that murder is no bar to participation in high politics. And when we treat with terrorist parties supported by small numbers of voters as is true of the Basque party and it used to be true of Sinn Fein, we are inciting murder a second time.  Because we have admitted, we are negotiating with them because they murder people and not for any other reason.  When you incite murder you get more murders.  Inciting terrorism has similarly produced a spreading stain of terrorism since the hijackings of Dawson Field in 1970.  Let me make a first qualification for this bold statement of principle.  If the price of halting a murderous insurgency is to admit the former terrorists into democratic politics that may sometimes be a price worth paying to save lives and establish a decent political order.  But it is a price.  The terrorists moreover must be former.  They must have abandoned terrorism finally, completely and publicly.  They cannot be mysteriously linked to terrorists still or leaving terrorism in a gradual way.  They must be exclusively committed to democratic politics and willing to accept its verdicts even when those verdicts are unfavorable to them.  I don't like making that concession.  It means that crimes go unpunished, injustice is entrenched and the moral [INAUDIBLE] of democracy is tainted. Note though that is a very limited concession.  While we may have to deal with former terrorists in official transactions of normal business, we should show them no signs of approval or respect.  Even if they hold high government positions, they must be given no state visits, no honorary knighthood, no White House dinners.  Until they have purged their guilt in some way, they must always feel the mark of Cane is on their brow.  But the distinguished advocates tonight, opposite, are proposing something far more dramatic than easing former thugs out of terrorism and into official limousines.  They suggest that we should treat as good faith democrats those who are still engaged in organizing suicide bombings and still planning rocket attacks.  Their election it seems somehow validates their terror methods or at least their terror methods do not invalidate their election.  Now here's my second qualification.  We are going to reach somewhat different conclusions, depending on whether we are citizens of a country in which there is a terrorist group engaged in democratic politics. For example, if we're a Lebanese democrat in a state which has Hezbollah as a political party.  Or depending on whether we are citizens of a state that is the um that is the neighbor of a country which has a terrorist government.  For example the citizen of Israel next door to a government that includes um Hamas.  Uh take the first case.  The citizen of the state in which there is a terrorist party.  Uh engaged in normal politics.  That means that one party in politics has got its own private army and the others do not.  It can intimidate the other parties.  It can overturn election results, it can ignore political defeats.  Uh it is not in a sense a normal political party at all.  And its very existence is a contradiction of the concept of democracy that most of us would recognize.  What happens in such cases?  Well let us take the most favorable case for the other side, that of the Northern Ireland peace process which most people think has been a good thing.  For the first eight years of this process [OVERLAPPING VOICES]\", \"OK.  I'm afraid I'm gonna skip to the, to the other point.  Different principles apply when we're talking about relations between states.  If a state is at war with another, whether or not the enemy government is democratic is a very secondary consideration.  What matters is the disposition of that state's foreign policy.   Does the other state have a serious interest in making peace?  If it makes peace will it keep its word?  Does it have long term aims compatible with a stable peace?  Are its internal dynamics such that the government offering to negotiate peace is likely to survive.  On strictly practical grounds, it is hard to imagine a prudent citizen answering those questions positively if the other government is composed of terrorists or routed in a terrorist party.  The terrorists have a serious interest in making peace  will they keep their word, are they trustworthy?  Do they generally have political aims compatible with a stable peace?  We should probably answer all those questions no.  And if the terrorist government is democratically elected [OVERLAPPING VOICES]\", \"The prognosis might be worse rather than better.  After all if an electorate has voluntarily elected a terrorist party, it's internal dynamics are unlikely to be favorable to peace making and political stability.  So for that reason it doesnt really matter whether or not Hamas is democratically elected.  What matters is whether or not it carries on its terrorist methods.  [APPLAUSE]\", \"I, I may take a different view from some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle on this question.  Um as a matter of fact, my sticking point is violence.  Do you, do groups who are standing for election continue to advocate and practice violence?  Thats, to me is the sine qua non, if they do, if they maintain a private army, if they are uh, if they are acting as for example, um, the IRA continued to act for some years after the Good Friday agreement, I'm against that.  Now I think in the case of uh, Islamist standing for election, I'm absolutely in favor of it.  I think the American government is taking a risk in, in urging free elections when it will, theyll sometimes bring to power people who are hostile to American foreign policy.  But thats a risk which we have to take. After all, its a risk which we take with every other part of the world and, and we have to live with that.  I think in the case of Hamas, we put ourselves in a somewhat false position and my pos-, and this is a rather complicated point here, but once we had accepted the legitimacy of Hamas standing, it seems to me we had crossed that Rubicon.  And once they, having, their having been elected, we simply had to accept that they were, they were there.  I would not have said that they were a legitimate contender in the election myself until, as I say, theyd abandoned violence which is my, in a sense, not my sole criterion, perhaps, but my overriding criterion.\", 'I think that there is, just on the general point here, there are consequences to launching unsuccessful wars against Israel.  The first is that Israel ends up with territories which didnt originally belong to it, the second is that there are going to be large numbers of refugees, and the third is that the Israelis, given their strategic, long-term vulnerability are going to be very suspicious of proposals for peace that dont come accompanied by guarantees.  But do come accompanied by demands for a right of return that would negate the Jewish state altogether.', 'There, there were terrorist acts against British troops, during the war, by the way, just to make that point.', \"Well I'm delighted that there are distinguished psychiatrists, doctors, lawyers and so on in Hamas, and at the moment Radovan Karadzic is on the run from NATO as a war criminal.  He himself was a child psychiatrist before the war started.  I wonder what became of his charges.  Its unusual for me to find myself as the idealist on the platform, but I point out that the argument that we should be having as well as the particular argument about the Middle East is an argument about violence in politics. When violence enters politics, its very hard to drive it out again. And when indiscriminate violence against innocent people enters, it damages the society very strongly indeed.  Now thats not the only way to have a revolution.  Polish solidarity won independence from Russia.  And that has been repeated in Georgia and in the Ukraine and elsewhere by a campaign of moral resistance and cultural resistance that wore down the opposition and persuaded people to come over to it.  Thats the, thats the kind of revolution if the, if one is needed.  Thats the kind of revolution, recourse that we should encourage people to pursue. We should not turn a blind eye to their crimes because they have managed to be elected.  Its a fine thing to be elected, but it doesnt absolve you from the laws of human conduct that the rest of us are supposed to obey.  [APPLAUSE]\"]\n",

      "['Extraordinary how people who want to silence public speech wont shut up.  [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  Were faced tonight with people who want to stop cartooning but who make a caricature of the concept of free speech.  They are not here to discuss free speech, they are here to discuss their deep conviction that speech is not free and therefore should not be free.  That is essentially what the previous speaker said, she said there is no free speech, lets be real, and therefore there should be no free speech and we should simply start restricting it endlessly.  Since we are being cartooned as the monstrous side, let me begin with a monstrous image.  In Northern Uganda for the last 15 to 20 years, there has been a movement known as the Lords Resistance Army.  It practices its warfare in the name of God, and what it does when it dislikes the speech that is being made is that it cuts off the lips of the citizens who are speaking and it puts padlocks through punctured holes in their lips and shuts them. Im afraid that Im very much unable to picture these people doing that, but its very clear to me that that is what they wish to do.  I will return to this image at the end, but that is the image that clearly you must bear in mind as you, the jury tonight, vote on the question of whether we shall be permitted to speak or whether we shall be inclined to silence anybody in whom we find offense. That is what they are saying, and who are they to judge what is offensive?  Surely you have different ideas, surely we all have different ideas, and yet somehow, the concept of offense is being proposed by the other side as some sort of universal measure of civilization rather than the opposite.  But one point of agreement that we have is that speech is fiercely powerful, and can be intensely dangerous.  I spent some time reporting from Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide there.  The previous speaker referred to genocide, and one of the most striking things in Rwanda is that in a great deal of the genocide was incited by public speech, radio speech, incitement through words.  The words were used as hate speech, which we will find the other side thinks should be censored because it is dangerous.  The hate speech said, invariably, kill the minority, the Tutsis.  They didnt always say it directly, they would use euphemisms and the euphemisms would be phrases like Do your work.  Clear the bush.  Do not let a weed escape the blade. These were phrases that were well understood in the historical context and they were clearly hate speech, theres no ambiguity about it.  Those people have been tried and convicted for inciting mass murder in their country.  The problem there was not free speech for haters.  It was that this was the officially sanctioned speech by people who prohibited sanity from being free speech. Anybody who protested against the genocide was silenced as offensive.  Offensive speech, my goodness.  That Hutus and Tutsis should live side by side in comity, that they should allow each other to existhow offensive.  Lets silence them.  Lets murder them.  Let us have official speech.  That was the position. That is the position whichyes, maam.  Slippery slope.  Its not a slippery slope, its a greased precipice over which they wish to push you.  [LAUGHTER]  Once you start to say that racist or blasphemous speech is somehow or other offensive, youre immediately on the quick descent towards book-burning.  The books that you wish to burn are the books that include, lets say, Huck Finn, where racists are used in possibly the 19th centurys noblest portrait of a black man in America.  Blasphemous speech is used by Ahab.  Most people who are burning books are of course too illiterate to notice.  [LAUGHTER]  But lets focus on the facts.  They consistently elevate idiotic speech, like Holocaust denial, to a greatly important role by saying, lets us illegalize it, challenge it in courts, give these people a tremendous platform, and prove that theyre wrongwhen no sane person can possibly suspect that this is serious history. So were going to have to elevate them in order to silence them, rather than to ignore them, to discuss it with them.  I would like to quote to you a short passage from David Cesarani in which he wrote, Celebrating Austrias Law Criminalizing Holocaust Denial.  This was in The Guardian.  Thanks to the Internet, he claims, it is virtually impossible to stop the dissemination of laws and propaganda these days.  The classical arguments of freedom of speech drawn from Voltaire and Mill are redundant.   So we have an anti-enlightenment argument very strongly stated.  They addressed small, literate elites at a time when the means of reproduction were relatively few and easily controlled, when it was easy to contend that in a contest between truth and falsehood held among reasonable men, lies would be exposed and driven from the public sphere. But the Internet is awash with falsehood and bigotry.  Good ideas and beautiful truths coexist with trash and outright evil.  Heaven forfend that bad ideas should be out there.  Amid this anarchy, he says, all that decent people can do is agree to reasonable limits on what can be said and set down legal markers in an attempt to preserve a democratic, civilized and tolerant society. Thats what he says.  I say, who gives him the right to set up a chair in the antechambers of my mind and judge what Im allowed to say and what Im allowed to think.  Is that what you want?  Is that who you want?  [APPLAUSE]  How does it avail the cause of civilization, sir, to fight brownshirts with brownshirt tactics?  I would like to know that.  What I share with this pious trinity of the opposing team is a deeply pessimistic view of human history.  I do not believe that if you let people run around loose theyre going to have nice ideas about each other and behave nicely towards each other, because thats not what they do. Their response is to cut off their lips and to clamp on a padlock. To decide who should be in the Sanhedrin of the mind and who should be in the Sanhedrin of the soul, sit around and tell you what youre allowed to say and what youre allowed to think. They do not understand that there is not agreement about this. They seem to assume that somehow or other it will always prevail.  Yes, they say times change, sometimes its allowed to be racist, sometimes its allowed to be anti-racist.  Sometimes we silence the people who are pro-Jewish, sometimes we silence the people who are anti-Muslim, but thats okay because were just rolling with the times, and were always going to let the people who we sort of think are civilized speak in the name of civility. I think that this is extremely dangerous.  I return, that while they conclude that we must accept that because speech is limited we must put ourselves in charge of limiting it, that we are dealing here really with a case of lesser evils.  The question before us tonight, simply put and simply stated in the proposition that we were given, is that freedom of speech must include a license to offend.  I would expand that license to blaspheme, and I would not call it a license.  They speak of it as a license, they think all speech is a license and that all speech should be licensed because most speech should be restricted before it is licensed. Then we decide, okay, well let this out, well let that out, well let this out, well let that out.  I think that thats a very, very, very dangerous precipice on which they want to perch us.  I do not trust them, even though I think that theyre probably more trustable than most. But what is to say that they will stay in charge of that speech? What is to say that we will not fall into the hands of somebody we dont trust?  What is to say that the message that one day seems somewhat sane, the next day becomes to kill, and that the people who say let us not kill are silenced in the name of reasonable speech and in the name of civilization to moderate that.  I remind you one last time as you go to vote, if you believe in chopping off lips and clamping on padlocks on open mouths, theres your troika. [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]', 'Yeah.', 'He was much on my mind as I came here tonight.

Were going to eradicate Nazism, rather than by having Nazis in a country where you can actually speak to them and argue with them, and not dignify them by putting them on trial every time they say something completely idiotic.

Because one would not get an audience for them because people would protest those stations because people would make firm phone calls exercising their freedom of speech to say, you know what?  We dont want anything to do with you.  You have no basis, I bet, youve never made a phone call, youve never asked a question, and youve done no reporting to find out whether Abe Foxman made that call, which has never been proven.  I sit on the board of Penn and we raised the Tony Judd question.  Absolutely nobody could ascertain whether or not Abe Foxman made that call.  He may have made it, or he may not.  Somebody made the call.  But youre', 'very, very, very confident  [LAUGHTER]  Youre very, very confident in accusing of somebody in public of something that you know nothing about', 'which is gross ignorance, but no, I would like to finish something for a minute, Jeffrey.  Im not done.  A gentleman with a British accent asked a question earlier of David Cesarani which he ducked very carefully.  He raised the question, why is it that youre so nervous about the broad public in his criticism of Enlightenment thinking and of Mill and of this one and that one. He sort of yearns for a clubby time, when you could count on a few select elites having a kind of common agreement.  And that now whats dangerous to him is the proliferation of voices, the idea that there are many ideas out there on the Internet, oh my goodness, and we cant regulate them, and they might get in the hands of the wrong people and we cant even agree who they are. For goodness sakes, those clubby people, as they put it, you know, even the Jews can have an opinion.  I mean, why are you so concerned that there might actually be some unregulated voices out there?', 'Weve done this question, yes, yes, its a waste of a question', 'Of course not', 'Waste of a question', 'That was useful for the radio audience', 'Wait.  Who stars?', 'We docked some of her time, remember.  We docked some of her time.', 'The proposition is, freedom of expression must include the license to offend.  I would return to the idea that this is fundamentally the lesser of various not-ideal prospects.  The other prospect is that one licenses someone to determine what offends, and that one is always at the prey of that question.  Who is to judge, who is to decide, how are we to restrict their ability to license our ability to offend.  In other words how are we to restrict their ability to restrict us.  At what point does this admittedly slippery slope immediately become this greased precipice, and we fall off into a very dangerous situation. The other side says, speech is dangerous, speech can be hateful, theres hatred and ignorance out there, and therefore they want, in some way, to muzzle the people they fear are dangerous.  I agree with them that speech can be dangerous and that there is a great deal of hatred and ignorance out there.  Weve heard a good deal of ignorance even tonight.  I feel that that is why I urge you strongly to listen to the dangerous speech youre hearing from the other side, and recognize exactly how it can impinge upon your ability not only to speak but to think.  The fact that they keep using this strangely castrated phrase, the N word.  Which is supposed to be inoffensive, but is actually doubly offensive because it restricts you from the ability to hear the full offense of the word nigger.  Theyre at every time trying to double back and triple around and make you use words and trip over your own mind and not think and not speak what actually might occur to you in your effort to observe reality and contend with it.  I think thats a very dangerous predicament, I think that theyre presumptuous and wild in their notion that we can do that reasonably, and I think that we are at less risk taking the great risk of freedom.

      "['Well now, Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sistersif I may say, comrades and friends.  [LAUGHTER]  Okay, then, Fire!  [LAUGHTER]  Its not that crowded a theater, but Fire! again.  You see?  If you remember the appalling judgment actually rendered by Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in that case, he was comparing the action that Ive just imitated and parodied to the action of a group of Yiddish-speaking socialists who gave out a leaflet, in Yiddish only, opposing Mr. Wilsons war and actually calling attention as they were to a major conflagration raging in Europe in which they did not think the United States should become involved. Be very, very, very careful when people give you arguments from authority or tradition that suggest that free speech can be limited by higher authorities like the sainted Holmes, because thats what youll get.  The end of it is a group of Yiddish-speaking radicals told they cant hand out a leaflet in Yiddish on a major question of the day.  Thats always how it will end, no matter how high-mindedly or creepily or sinisterly its presented to you.  My favorite crowded-theater story is actually about the terrible Broadway production of The Diary of Anne Frank.  Some people may remember this, its a production famous for its longueurs. [LAUGHTER]  In the third act as the German soldiers came pounding on the door and stamping into the parlor, someone in the front row shouted, Shes in the attic!  [LAUGHTER]  Call me old-fashioned if you will, ladies and gentlemen, but as you will see I dont think a joke is really a joke unless its at somebodys expense. Now if youre thick-skinned and broad-backed enough to take that, I might have a bit more for you.  The real question, utterly, utterly dodged by David in his shady remarks, is this.  Whos going to decide.  Weve already found that Oliver Wendell Holmes isnt competent on the point.  Who will you appoint.  Who will be the one who says, I know exactly where the limits should be, I know how far you can go and I know when youve gone too far, and Ill decide that.  Who do you thinkwho do you knowwho have you heard of, who have you read about in history to whom youd give that job?  I always say, just for this evening, I wouldnt give it to anyone whos spoken so far on the other side. [LAUGHTER]  Now, I sure do know a bit about Milton and quite a lot about Thomas Paine as well.  Mr. Paine actually updated and I think improved John Miltons Areopagitica which is the classic case for free expression. Those of you who know Areopagitica and Paines commentary on it will know that it recommends free speech in this waynot for you, but for the people you are listening to and the people whose comments you hope to hear in return, for your own education, for your own enlightenment and for your own elucidation.  As Mr. Paine says, commenting on Milton, one of the vices of those who would repress the opinions of others is they make themselves prisoners of their own opinions, because they deny themselves the rights and the means of changing them.  Should this not be as plain as could be?  The free interplay of ideas is not something that those of us who wish to speak or unload our opinions insist upon for that sake, its because we want to hear what is said in response, however unwelcome it may be to us. Thus the defense of any one opinion or form of expression is a defense of all of them.  The classic statement in modern times of this, in my view, would be Aryeh Neiers book Defending My Enemy where he describes the decision of the American Civil Liberties Union, of which I am a supporter, to take the case of the American Nazi Party and its right to parade swastikas through the town of Skokie, Illinois, a favorite retirement community for those whod survived the final solution.  The ACLU lost a lot of members on that proposition but we did the right thing by the First Amendment.  In the book he has a wonderful extract from Robert Bolts play A Man for All Seasons which some of you will have seen at least in celluloid form, where if you recall, Sir Thomas More is talking to one of the witch-hunters and prosecutors. He says, So youd cut a road through the laws, would you, to get after the Devil?  The witch-hunter and prosecutor says, Id cut down every law in England to do that.  Thomas More says, Thats worth knowing.  And when the Devil turned round to meet you and had you at bay, where would you look for shelter, Mr. Prosecutor, the laws all being flat and cut down?  Where would you turn then?  Its impossible ever to think of infringing the right of anyone else to free speech without arranging, in a sense calling in advance for this to happen to you too.  Its quite different, obviously different, from any question of information. Information may be classified and information may be copyrighted.  Every word said on that score by the first speaker on the other side was a complete waste of her breath, because its not what were meant to talk about.  Were meant to talk about the expression of opinion and conviction, not breach of copyright or leaking of classified information.  If wed wanted to talk about that, we wouldve phrased the motion differently. Thereve been some bad signs lately, a lot of slippage in what I would have thought was the pedantic obviousness of the points Ive just made.  The imprisonment of David Irving in Austria for a thought crime, for the possibility that he might while in Austria have given a speech saying that he doubts some of the verdicts of history on what I call the final solution.  Theres no victim to this crime.  The Austrian consul called me up weeping with self-pity when I pointed this out in The Wall Street Journal and said, But we thought finally Austria would be popular.  [LAUGHTER]  We had something that you would all like!  So gut muttlich.  That the land that survives on the myth that Hitler was German and Beethoven was Viennese, that had Waldheim as its chancellor and has Jorg Heider as a member of its government, can revenge itself on a defenseless British academic and jail him is a standing disgrace. There are attempts to extend similar thought-crime laws to other topics of historical importance, the most depressing of which recently is the provisional decision of the French parliament to criminalize discussion of the Armenian massacre, considered by me and most others to have been a planned genocide in the early part of the 20th century.  Now you couldnt take the contrary view. You couldnt for example argue, as you can, that actually in the provinces of Turkey where Russian forces were not engaged, Armenians were not massacred.  In other words, it could be that it was partly an act of war as well as an act of ethnocide. Speculations of this kind would now be actually in peril.  The law on which its modeled, the Loi Gayssot, which criminalizes in France discussion of the Holocaust as well, is named for the French Stalinist, Monsieur Gayssot, who sponsored it and whose spirit, and the spirit of whose hero is present in all of these and other such discussions. I stipulate that all of these things, when they happen, offend me very much.  Im offended by them, I want you to understand.  It goes to the core of what I do and what I am.  The First Amendment doesnt just provide me with a living, the First Amendment is my life.  When its infringed, I am offended, I have claimed the right to be offended.  I do not claim the right to go burn down someone elses place of worship, to threaten their religion with violent reprisal, to picket their home, to publish their name in threatening terms on the InternetI wont do any of that.  It doesnt mean I cant be offended but it does mean that Im even more offended by those who claim the right, not just to be offended, but to seek violent reprisal, as is so vividly and currently being done by the votaries of the prophet Mohammed, in recent instances which I have no time at all to inform you but about which you already know and to which I hope I will be asked to return.  Thanks very much. [APPLAUSE]', 'Excuse me', 'No, thats offensive.', 'Thats stupid.', 'Stupid, nasty', 'Finish by naming the rabbi.', 'I want to know who that rabbi was', 'Name that rabbi', 'Name that rabbi', 'Nor was I, actually, I was only pretending to be.

Very much to the contrary', 'His book, his edition of The Goebbels Diary is a very useful and interesting book that everyone who wants to know more about the period should read.', 'For example, its only in that book that its proved that the British Union of Fascists took money from the Nazi party, a claim theyd always denied.  The question is, do you think youre big enough to read a book by David Irving and make up your own mind about it, or do you think that someone else should do that for me. Right?  [APPLAUSE]', 'A very simple question. AUDIENCE MEMBER Alan Miller, New York Salon.  I do take issue particularly with David Cesaranis view, when he talks about how vulnerable everyone is.  Its almost like an egalitarian-speak, this notion that humans are not robust and cannot discuss ideas and make decisions and be autonomous.  So my question to the panel tonight is, when it comes to the really tricky, sticky issues, like we see around children and pedophilia, or as we see on the campuses, where we see speech etiquette, or when we see in the workplaces speeches of code, would they agree with the prospect that you should have the right to be offensive, and free speech at all times.  Thats my question to them.', 'A very nice animal', 'Okay.', 'When Dr. Samuel Johnson had finished his great lexicography, the first real English dictionary, he was visited by various delegations of people to congratulate him, including a delegation of Londons respectable womanhood who came to his parlor in Fleet Street and said Doctor, we congratulate you on your decision to exclude all indecent words from your dictionary.  He said, Ladies, I congratulate you on your persistence in looking them up.   [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  I think anyone who understands that story, which Im pleased to see everybody obviously does, will see through the sinister piffle we were treated to just now.  If people are determined to be offended, if they will climb up on the ladder, balancing it precariously on their own toilet system, to be upset by what they see through the neighbors bathroom window, theres nothing you can do about that. [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]  The Imams in Denmark did the following.  First, they invited the intervention of 22 foreign ambassadors in Denmarks internal affairs, itself a disgrace, and the Danish prime minister quite rightly repudiated it.  Then they added two cartoons of their own, drawn by them, one of them showing the prophet Mohammed in the shape of a pig, then they shopped those round the Muslim world until they could get kindling going under the embassies of a small democracy in the capitol cities of countries where demonstrations are normally not allowed. They violated Danish diplomatic immunity, they tried to sabotage the Danish economy, there were random pogroms and attacks on individual Scandinavians.  And, David Cesarani says he doesnt like the reminiscence of the 1930s that is inscribed in the cartoon.  I dont like the reminiscence of the 1930s that is involved in a Kristallnacht against Denmark, put up by religious demagogues and thugs, and thats what needs to be put down. [APPLAUSE]', 'So would I.', 'What kind of foolishness is this', 'Dont be silly', 'I take it as', 'I take it', 'I am going to take it as a tribute to the superior cogency of our side that theres this repeated change of subject from the other side.

He kicked up a terrific fuss because of some remarks Id once made about Theodore Herzl, among other things, and got the meeting canceled. Now, I dont particularly complain about that as a matter of fact, and I dont share in the tremendous steambath of self-pity that Mr. Judd has managed to generate.  [LAUGHTER]  You have a right to your opinion.  You dont have necessarily have a right to the audience of the Republican Jewish Committee.  They can decide not to have you.  Thats okay.

Now if I dont tell you exactly what I think about the simpering speeches that we heard from the other side, Im not censoring myself, Im just being polite and civil and saving some of your time.  What I will not prevent myself from saying, and will not let anyone else prevent me from saying, is the following.  It is wrong and always has been for churches, powerful, secular, human institutions, to claim exemption from criticism, which is whats really being asked here.  If theres going to be respect, it has to be mutual.  Does Islam respect my right to un-belief?  Of course it does not.  Does it respect the right of a Muslim to apostasize and change belief?  Of course it does not.  I can name now four or five friendssix or eight, maybe, if I had timefive or six you would certainly have heard ofwho have to live their lives under police protection for commenting on Islam. For having an opinion on it.  This is getting steadily worse all the time, and its grotesque.  Here is an enormous religion with gigantic power that claims that an archangel spoke to an illiterate peasant, and brought him a final revelation that supercedes all others. Its a plagiarism by an epileptic of the worst bits of Judaism and Christianity.  Thats obvious, it seems to me.  [APPLAUSE]  How long do you think Im going to be able to say that anywhere I like? It would already be quite a risky thing to say in quite a lot of places.  I did not come to the United States of America 25 years to learn how to keep my mouth shut.  Im going to reject all offers that I change that policy, however simperingly they are put, okay? [APPLAUSE]']\n",
      "['Thank you, and thank you, Jeffrey.  Since World War III almost started over a bunch of cartoons, I want to thank this evenings organizers for including a cartoonisttwo, if you include Christopher Hitchens.  [LAUGHTER]  150 years ago, the Tammany Hall politician Boss Tweed responded to an offensive cartoon against him with the famous line, Stop them damn pictures. The reason were here tonight, is that these days, everyone wants to stop them damn pictures, if the damn pictures in question hurt their feelings or the feelings of their tribe.  When I say everyone, I mean everyone.  Early in my career, I penned this badly-drawn cartoon, Fundamental Sex Eddoes the stork bring AIDS and herpes too?  [LAUGHTER]  I expected calls from the fundamentalist ministers in the area, but no, I got calls from schoolteachers saying, Not all teachers are fat, old and carry rollers!  [LAUGHTER]  Schoolteachers arent alone.  In the course of my 25 years as a paid professional offender, I have been attacked for criticizing people of color, people without much color, people of guns, people of excessive weight, people with trial lawyers, and Armenian people.  This is a partial list, and certainly doesnt begin to cover people of religion, who are the touchiest people of all.  Unfortunately for the pious, Americans like their damn cartoons and they always have.  In ninein 1872, Joseph Keppler drew this tribute to religion, which as you can see on the lower left, offensive caricatures Jews, and on the right, offensively caricatures Catholics. But waitin the middle, he offensively caricatures Episcopalians, Mormons, Baptists, Presbyterians, and even Henry Ward Beecher, the New Age minister and adulterer of his age.  [LAUGHTER]  If we had more time, Id show more cartoons.  So, when newcomers arrive on our shores, with their deeply held religious beliefs, they should be prepared to get in line to have those beliefs scrutinized, as they did in the mid-1800s when New York City, like Denmark today, was awash with poor foreign immigrants who came with their robed clerics and demands for separate schools.  These were of course Catholics, not Muslims, but some American cartoonists reacted just the way the Danes did.  In 1871, the father of American cartoonists, Thomas Nast, drew this.  The American River Ganges.  The hats of the reptilian bishops crawling ashore have menacing crocodile teethcertainly the precursors of a turban as a bomb. Usually, my colleagues dont go out of their way to kick a clergyman.  However, when the clergy ask for special privileges, demand special tax cuts, or are just especially misbehaving, we take notice.  This Pat Oliphant, The Running of the Altar Boys [LAUGHTER]  Youre cutting into my time, stop laughing.  It was embraced by many lay Catholics, but bitterly denounced by official Catholicism.  Note to church leadersif you dont want your clerics ridiculed as child abusers, make sure they dont abuse children.  Had Americans been able to see the Danish cartoons, they wouldve noted that they too were not just gratuitous attacks on the faithful.  One was making fun of the idea that after blowing up innocent people, suicide bombers would be rewarded with virgins in Heaven.  If you cant make fun of that, what can you make fun of.  [LAUGHTER] What really enraged believers wasnt that Mohammed was pictured but that he was pictured negatively.  To test the point, at the height of the controversy I put Mohammed in this cartoon, The Big Fat Book of Offensive Religious Cartoons.  [LAUGHTER] Hes third from the right, flanked by Jesus and God, and a few other laughing deities.  No one protested this because no one cared about Mohammed being drawn as jolly and benign. However, I have been picketed without putting Mohammed in a cartoon.  Radical Islam Sponsors the Miss Muslim World ContestMiss Illiteracy, Miss Cant Vote, Miss Waiting to Be Stoned.  [LAUGHTER]  When I say picketed, I mean picketed, including  [APPLAUSE]  including by one of my daughters high school history teachers. But Muslims arent alone in their selective outrage.  My Jewish readers were okay with the drawing with the Star of David that was pro-Israel, but roasted me for one that criticized a local Jewish senator who was attacking his opponent for being anti- Semitic.  Critics said that the Star of David was off-limits unless, apparently, it was used to make a point that they agreed with.  What critics of offensive cartoons forget is that every time I exercise my free speech, my readers exercise theirs, swiftly and loudly.  For that last little sketch with the Star of David, our paper received and printed weeks of vilifying letters.  The Anti- Defamation League denounced me, I was called a Nazi, and the senators son helpfully suggested to my editors how they could better use my talents. One reader wrote that I was worthy of Hustler magazine, which at my age I take as something of a compliment.  [LAUGHTER] Speaking of Hustler, its publisher, Larry Flynt, is the patron saint of cartoonists.  When Hustler ran a spoof claiming that Jerry Falwells first sexual  encounter was with his mother in an outhouse the right reverend Falwell did the Christian thing, and sued, in a case that went to the Supreme Court in 1987.  The unanimous decision was written by that famed pinko degenerate, William Rehnquist, who wrote that Even though the spoof was outrageous, outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse is inherently subjective, and that the court has long protected free speech, even speech that offends the audience.  So the offended are left with the same option I usefree speech. They can and do write, call, picket, boycott, and draw their own cartoons, but in America, thank God and the Constitution, they cant claim special privileges and stop them damn pictures. Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Im for going back to the 13th century, personally.', 'Is that the question?', 'I beg your pardon.  [LAUGHS]', 'One little example of how this works in the real world was in the mid-90s at the University of Pennsylvania.  There were some kids making noise outside of a dorm room.  Some guy leaned out the window and told the water buffaloes to shut up.  The water buffaloes took it to the speech code people at the university.  Had they not, the guy who had said water buffaloes wouldve been the jerk that he was, but as it turned out, then the girls who got all upset about it made a federal case out of it.  They ended up looking stupid, as did the administration of the University of Pennsylvania.  Water buffaloes, I mean where are you going to draw the line?  Its an animal, its not like saying', 'Im going to kill you.  So to me its likeif you let someone say something stupid, theyre the ones who look idiotic.  If then you startlike David Irving, I might addbut when you start taking him on and like Christopher said giving him the platform, then its you who are starting to look like you cant quite join the debate.', 'I get that kind of speech all the time.  One of my favorites was being called a liberal cocksucker.  [LAUGHTER]  Now, I dont know whether that means I like to cock-suck liberally [LAUGHTER] or I only suck liberal cock or I just am not quite sure.  But I didnt call the police on it.  Furthermore, half the people who write me horrible, horrible things, no one has seen my mail, they all start it, Dear Mr. Wilkinson.  [LAUGHTER]  So its not me as a woman, its the ideas I put in the paper, and if we cant discuss those ideas, even when they talk to me in loathsome, funny ways, we cant talk. The one thing I would like to say about the whole Danish cartoonist thing is this.  Having had that confrontation has changed minds on both sides.  The BBC reported that about two weeks ago there was another minor dust-up about it.  But the reason you didnt hear about it is because the Muslim side realized that it really wasnt great PR to kill people in Pakistan to protest cartoons in Denmark.  So its a much different protest, its been handled differently on both sides, including the Danish side. This is how we learn.  [LAUGHS]  We learn by conflict, we learn by calling each other things that, ehh, well, maybe werent a great idea at the time, but we can do it differently next time.', 'Well, I basically said earlier pretty much what I think here.  Ill just go back to what Christopher said.  This is a conversation.  If you forbid someone to say whats truly on their mind, you wont know what is on their mind.  Its better almost every time, it seems to me, to find out what it is, and then be able to deal with it.   I think that some of the questions get back to what is truly hateful speech and our history is filled with, for example, horrible images of black Americans who were made fun of simply because they were black, and these images occurred everywhere, in Courier and Ives and all of the major publications in the United States. But the way that changed was not by someone saying, you may not ever, ever do a bad caricature of a black person.  It was changed because the civil rights movement and black Americans showed through their own incredible endurance and persistence in going for equal rights in this country, that that movement made those images look awful.  You cant look at them today without wincing.  It says more about the people who drew the cartoons than about who they were drawn by [sic].  I feel sorry for you in New York because you dont have very many really bitter cartoons published here, the New York Times protects you from that.  [LAUGHTER]   But I really urge you to go on the Web, find out what people are thinking, and youll find out through cartoons among other pieces of free speech.']\n",

      "['[Thank you.  Im intrigued by the Dating Game idea so maybe we can return to that in the question part.  Its an evening event, everybodys tired from work.  To judge the motion, We must tolerate a nuclear Iran, you must evaluate the alternatives to it. Ideally, the United States and other leading actors can prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.  Indeed, all six of us here agree emphatically that the U.S. and the international community must do everything possible, and more than has been done already, to try to prevent this.  We all agree with that, we all work on that much of our time.  We can talk about some of the steps that that might entail, including the United States being willing to engage in direct negotiations with Iran if Iran is willing to do so, which is a big question.  We should talk about security guarantees to Iran, which Patrick has written about in the form of, We will not attack you if you dont attack us.  We should right now be mustering Irans neighbors perhaps secretly, some of it openlyinto a much tighter, cohesive network to try to cooperate on intelligence, air monitoring, perhaps moving ballistic missile defenses into the region, to show Iran that its freedom of maneuver will be diminished if it moves forward with nuclear weapons. We have to be much more direct with President Putin in Russia. Russia is the biggest impediment of getting the Security Council to take strong actions, and we can talk about that later.  The general point is, prevention, all of us agree, is the best option. Yet prevention is not the proposition weve been asked to debate here tonight.  The question we are debating, is whether we can tolerate a nuclear Iran.  That question assumes that diplomacy has failed, and were on to other options.  Then we have to ask, well, what are the alternatives to tolerating an Iran that possesses nuclear weapons.  Well, one might say, well, we kill ourselves.  If we cant tolerate, we kill ourselves.  Thats not a good option. The second option will be, well, well kill all of them.  Make the problem go away.  Also not a good option, there are 74 million of them, three times the population of Iraq.  Even if somehow it were morally justifiable, it wouldnt necessarily solve the problem.  The most feasible strategy that is the alternative, the most feasible strategy for not tolerating a nuclear Iran, is an attacka combination of attack on its known nuclear facilities, on its air force and navy to try to prevent its capacity to retaliate immediately, and on the Revolutionary Guard, to try to hasten regime change.  This ought to be examined, and there are a long list of questions that arise from this.  But the key thing in terms of the motion before us is, that you should not assume that this is a question of will power.  In other words, if one says, I will not tolerate a nuclear Iran, that somehow that solves the problem, that the will power to actmeaning to conduct a warsomehow achieves the objective of eliminating Irans nuclear capability. Theres no reason actually to conclude that it wouldthat even if you had the will, you could eliminate that capability.  But you have to factor that in, as well as the consequences of a potential action.   Now if I thought that a military attack of this type I described would actually eliminate that nuclear capability, and do it for a sufficient time, I would be for it, if the consequences of our attack were not going to leave us worse off.  But to conclude that the consequences wont leave us worse off, you have to ask a bunch of questions.  To his great credit, Reuel Gerecht, our colleague, has written an essay last April in the Weekly Standard, thats a very detailed treatment of a military option, which he ultimately advocates.  Reuel talks about a campaign, a military campaign, that he says would be a series of actions and counter- actions between the U.S. and Iran, that would probably transpire over many years, perhaps a decade or more. Now theres a long list of questions that arise when you contemplate a war with Iran lasting a decade or more.  Youd have to know if we buy some time, maybe two or three years, in the first attack, what happens.  Well, the most likely thing that happens is the inspectors have to go, thats been our major source of intelligence.  So now when you want to figure out what else to attack over these years, your capacity actually to pinpoint things has diminished.  The probability of hitting false targets, wrong targets, killing innocent people, being subjected to media treatments then of the mistaken bombing, goes up, and with each mistaken bomb, U.S. credibility in the world, in the region, in Iran, is diminished.  There are other questions.  What are the odds then an air war will improve the prospects for democracy in Iran?  What are the odds that another war will make Iran less threatening to the U.S. and Israel? What are the odds that another war led by the United States will increase Americas capacity to solve the other problems in the worldIraq, Afghanistan, the war on terror, international trade? You name the issues, will our credibility be enhanced if we conduct another war in the Middle East?  Now Reuel wrote his essay before the war in Lebanon.  I would argue that war has even further raised the bar, the difficulty, of thinking that a war against Iran will actually solve this problem.  We believe that another war would leave the United States and the world worse off than we would be by pursuing an alternative strategy.  If you agree, you should vote in favor of the resolution.  We argue theres plenty of evidence to conclude that if more energetic efforts to prevent Iran from getting nuclear', 'fail, it will still be possible to deter and contain Iran from using nuclear weapons against anyone.  Irans president is alarming, he is indeed alarming.  But the leadership in Iran is collective, and it includes many old men.  These old men did not get old by being suicidal.  Iran, Persia, has thousands of years of grand history, and theres no reason whatsoever to think that Iranian nationalists would sacrifice their nation and their civilization in a nuclear war of their making.  There is other evidence of Irans deterability.  Iran has not attacked the weaker United Arab Emirates with which it has a dispute over two resource-rich islands.  Iran did not attack the Sunni extremist Taliban government in Afghanistan, even when that government killed, murdered, nine Iranian diplomats.', 'Iran has a Jewish population that is free to leave but chooses not to.  There is no evidence that Iran is not deterable.  Indeed, as Reuel has written, The Islamic republic ceased to produce holy warriors by the end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988.  The potential for chiliastic rapture has just dried up.  The bigger point is this. Voting for the motion does not mean doing nothing, or turning the other cheek to Iran.  Voting for the motion means deciding that another war will not solve this problem, and that a robust, extremely tough strategy of deterrence and containment would be the most effective way to keep a nuclear Iran from threatening the United States and its friends.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'I thought that was the safe position.', 'Thats the conservative position against euthanasia', 'Well, I think well come to this later.  Were now confused about what it means to tolerate or not to tolerate, because I happen to agree with everything Patrick said because he didnt talk about going to war.  I agree with Reuel and Bill, we should do everything we can to try to prevent it.   So if what we mean by tolerating is that we really, really dont like it, were going to do everything we can to stop it, but we would accept living with it if that was the alternative other than war, then I think we agree.  If the alternative really is what Bill said, but not what Patrick said, that not tolerating it means that you are willing to go to war over it, then I would say to your question, theres only been one case in history where there was a military effort to stop a country from trying to get nuclear weapons. That was the Israeli bombing of Iraq in 1981.  You can argue what the effects of that were in various ways.  Iraq went to war or was at war with Iran, and then, we had another war with them in 91 and then we had another war with them in 2003, and their nuclear program continued when we didnt think it was from 81 to 91, but when we thought it was or some people thought it was, it turned out it wasnt.  Were there now.  Every other case of getting a country to stop involved politics, negotiations, giving them benefits, security guarantees, trade-offs, and deals.  So we should be concerned about if Iran succeeds, what happens.  But the way the rest of the worlds going to respond to this is going to be if you marshal diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, plus rewards.  Thats the way to do it.', 'We dont disagree with that, that we have to accelerate and toughen diplomacy, that we dont want Iran to have nukes, all of that we agree with.  But what does it mean to not tolerate something?', 'I agree, and then if those dont fail, what does it mean not to talk. Bill says it means go to war.  Reuel has said it means go to war. Patrick hasnt quite said that, so Im not clear what the resolution is.', 'But what youre saying is pretend not to tolerate it.', 'And then maybe at some point you tolerate it, and Bill says', \"Again I'm confused by the terms.  Because we agree with almost everything especially that Patrick said.  And with much that Reuel and Bill said about its, the nature of the Iranian government.  What we want for the people of Iran.  How bad it would be if Iran got nuclear weapons.  And I don't understand what it means not to tolerate.  Because Patrick has used the verb say.  We should say we won't tolerate.  He said we should have credible threat by using force but avoids the issue of would it be our policy actually go to war.  Which to me means not tolerate. Bill's clear at least, he's saying yeah you know yeah we'll go to war.  Um that's what the resolution means on their side.  Not tolerate means physically stop.  Physically try to act against.  And then the question is does that guarantee success?  There is no guarantee of success.  We found the trouble in Iraq that was totally unanticipated.  Reasonable people would expect things to go badly in Iran.  So you can't guarantee \", \"Success.  We have an experience with China.  When China was getting nuclear weapons in 1964, the US Government was prepared to launch nuclear war against it, to destroy China, to keep it from getting nuclear weapons.  Then we thought no, instead of that we'll give nuclear weapons to India in 1963.  To balance China.  We were afraid that Mao was such a revolutionary.  He had killed more than twenty million of his own people.  Something the Iranian regime hasn't dreamed of.  We thought it would be the end of civilization, that revolution would happen everywhere under this nuclear umbrella.  Well in fact we decided that we couldnt stop China.  China got nuclear weapons. Here we are today.  China is a huge economic threat to us today but it isn't like you're gonna go home tonight worrying that China's gonna wake up and nuke the United States.  Which it does have the capability to do.  And which Iran for the foreseeable future would have no capability to do.  Do I think we should publicly say we'll tolerate it and welcome it?  Absolutely not.  But the exercise here is to try and clarify in your own mind, in your own plan -\"]\n",
      "['Okay.  Thank you so much for coming, its really a privilege to be here and its a privilege to be personally speaking for Bill Kristol. Its a big privilege and a big challenge.  When I was in high school my father used to watch the Sunday morning talk shows.  My favorite guest was always Bill Kristol because he was always so thoughtful and sensible and sensitive, I just assumed he was a liberal.  I must admit I was a late bloomer intellectually. [LAUGHTER] I would just like to first start off by reiterating the point that George made, that I think all six of us here are after the same thing at the end of the dayan Iran which is democratic, which is free, which is prosperous, and which is not armed with a nuclear weapon.  That would be the ideal option.  So the question is not whether or not the Islamic republic is a cruel regime.  It is, I can tell you as someone who has been detained in Tehran by the Revolutionary Guard, it is a cruel regime.  The question is not, again, why or whether or not Iran should have a nuclear weapon we should tolerate.  I think personally it would be disastrous if they were to acquire a nuclear weapon.  But the question on our panel is, should we tolerate it, and that begs the question, should we go to war with Iran to prevent it.  Which cost would be higher, to actually accept Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, or going to war with them to prevent it. I would suggest that the latter option would be far more dangerous, bombing Iran to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear. Im a bit surprised tonight that the other side of the table is seeming toIm a bit too junior to contradict them too muchbut theyre running away from the argument somewhat because both Reuel and Bill are on the record saying that they would bomb Iran.  So hopefully, we hear that from Bill in the next round. [LAUGHTER]   I would just argue similar to what Sanam said, that if Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was here tonight, he would be arguing on the other side of the table, meaning I think he very much wants to see a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran. I will just suggest why in three different contexts, why the Iranians, particularly the hard-liners in Tehran, would like to see a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran.  The first context is the regional context.  What was very interesting for me following the right-wing Iranian media was these comments which Secretary Rice made after the war in Lebanon in July.  What she called it was the birth pangs of a new Middle East.  When I was following the Iranian right-wing media, it was very interesting how much they agreed with Secretary Rice, they said indeed it is the birth pangs of a new Middle East.   Indeed this is a proxy war between the U.S. and Iran for hegemony in the Middle East, for Arab and Muslim hearts and minds.  In fact were very well- placed to fight this war, and whats very disconcerting right now is that these same newspapers in Tehran which are very fascist when it comes to domestic politics, are Jeffersonian democrats when it comes to regional politics because they say, actually, democratic elections are very much in our interest. Hamas came to power in Palestine, Hezbollah came to power in Lebanon through democratic elections, the Muslim Brotherhood had a very strong showing in Egypt.  Hardcore religious came to power in Iraq via democratic elections.  So in fact, we are winning this war for Arab and Muslim hearts and minds, and given the U.S.s low standing in the region, it looks like history is now on our side.  Opinion polls which are conducted show that among the Arab street, the three most popular leaders are Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, and Khaled Meshaal of Hamas.  So right now Iran feels in a very good position, and I think that bombing the country they would feel even better-placed to fight this war for Arab and Muslim hearts and minds. We should take into account that if we bomb Iran, oil prices are likely going to go up to $150 a barrel.  Currently the regime is making about $200 million a day on oil revenue, so we double that, theyre going to make $400 million a day on oil revenue.  I would argue that that will put them in a far better position to support Hamas and Hezbollah financially than if we dont bomb the country.  I think that just, if were serious about fighting this war, which is becoming very much this self-fulfilling prophecy of the clash of civilizations, were going to have to figure out a way to resolve our differences in the Middle East without using bombs. The second point is from a non-proliferation perspective, from a nuclear perspective.  What would happen if we actually bomb Iran to try to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Lets play out the scenario, in fact I played out the scenario with a Navy captain. Say we bomb these sites.  First of all we dont know where many of them are, some of them are underground, some of them we dont have intelligence on, so we cant be sure that we bombed the right sites.  Second of all some of them are near population centers, we would be killing Iranian civilians.  Quite frankly, you know, if you talk to nuclear physicists they say, well, Iran actually has quite a bit of know-how right now.  Its like baking a cake.  They have the ingredients, they have the recipe, and they have the cooks, they have the scientists.  Unless youre going to kill the scientists, youre going to kill the cooks, I mean, its going to be very difficult to set back this program a long way.  At most, in talking to nuclear physicists, it will take Iran two to three years to recalibrate.  At that point, if we bomb them, international public opinion may well side with them, and the Iranians may say in fact we now are after a nuclear weapon because we now have been shown that we need it to protect our sovereignty. At that point, when you bomb these sites and you dont know where Iran is recalibrating these facilities, maybe underground, if we really then want to avert the prospect well have to send in group troops.  At this point, with our troops spread thin in Iraq and Afghanistan, that doesnt look like a welcome prospect.  Now from the domestic perspective, this is the one that for me I feel most strongly about.  When I first started this job, I didnt get involved in this work because I was passionate about centrifuges and cascades and things like that, this is what George was saying', 'but about the prospect of the future for the Iranian people. Theres this widespread notion that all Iranians are in favor of a nuclear program, which I would like to debunk.  I think that, on one hand Iran is a nationalist country, and many people feel strongly that were a great nation, why this double standard. India and Pakistan can have this project, why cant we.  But at the same time this is a country that we forget experienced an eight-year war with Iraq.  Not really one family was left unscathed by this war, there were half a million casualties.  No one romanticizes the conflict or the prospect of further militarization. Quite frankly this is a very technical project, the idea of enriching uranium as opposed to importing enriched uranium from abroad, so the idea that your average Iranian in Shiraz or Tehran wakes up in the morning and says, you know, if only we could enrich uranium today our lives would be so much better half, has also been very much exaggerated.', 'But I would argue that you present to the Iranian people two options.  You present this publicly to the regime.  A, pursue this nuclear program unequivocally, come what may, for the sanctions, isolation, potential militarization.  Or B, you take certain nuclear compromises and you reenter the international community.  Youre going to have the people put a lot of pressure on the regime to change their behavior, and so far this has not been a policy option which has been issued by the U.S.  Thank you very much.', 'Obviously the United States is powerful enough to bomb Iran, thats not the question.  The question is the day after we bomb Iran, just like the question in Iraq should have been the day after we bomb Iraq.  Obviously the United States could change probably every regime in the world apart from a few, China, Russia, India.  But what are the repercussions for the day after? I would argue that at the moment even the Iranians believe that Iranian soft power is dominating U.S. hard power in Iraq.  I would just put on the table that its fundamentally incompatible to think were going to stabilize Iraq, while simultaneously dropping bombs on Iran, not to mention other countries in the region.  If we really want to try to tranquilize Lebanon, we will see a resurgent Hezbollah if we drop bombs on Iran.  We want to tranquilize Palestine and strengthen the moderate Palestinians were going to strengthen Hamas, if we do that.  I just want to make a further point that, Bill and Reuel have written that its unclear what would happen domestically within Iran if we dropped bombs.  Maybe actually, we could over time strengthen the Iranian moderates.  This always reminds me of a quote from John Limber, the great U.S. diplomat who was actually taken hostage in Iran for 444 days during the 1979 revolution. He was someone like many Iranians, my father included, who believed that when the Shah was deposed, the Shahs government would be replaced by a secular democracy, and what we saw of course was that Khomeini came to, to power.  He later wrote in his memoirs that, that what he learned was that when sudden upheavals happen, revolutions are not won by those who can write incisive op-ed pieces.  [LAUGHTER]  I think likewise in Iran we should have no illusions that if we bomb the country its going to be moderates who come to the helm either within Iran or within the region.', 'I stand by the statement that it would be a disaster if Iran were acquire a nuclear weapon, but I would just say it would be far more disastrous to bomb them to try to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  These are the scales were forced to measure right now.  I think Bill and Reuel and Patrick would agree that as long as this government is in power in Tehran, they will never feel comfortable that its somehow lost its nuclear ambitions.  As long as this government is in power I think theyll always feel that will happen.  My point is that if we bomb Iran, were going to prolong the life of this regime I would argue two, three, maybe four decades.  That whats going to happen is that these radicals are going to come to the helm, theyre going to clamp down on any type of moderates, and theyre going to have the pretext to do so.  So if you want to preserve the shelf life of this regime then we bomb it, thats my argument.', 'Id argue that at the end of the day whats going to change this regime is economic malaise.  Its not going to be bombing it, its not going to be a nuclear issue, but similar to the Soviet Union, at the end of the day you cant eat a nuclear weapon.  Thats whats going to change this government, but again I think that if we do give it a pretext to clamp down on its domestic population it will very much take it, and we could see the prospect of change moved back many years.  I would just argue as well that if we somehow were able to manage a nuclear-armed Soviet Union and a nuclear-armed China, which had far greater appetite than Iran did, it seems to me preposterous that we cant tolerate a nuclear- armed Iran in this context, in the context of deterrence.', \"I think one thing that's been missing tonight is Iran's ambitions. Iran's impetus.  We talked a lot about what the US is thinking, what Israel is thinking but we can't look at Iran's ambitions in a vacuum.  And if I would make the argument that as a  it's not that they want to pursue nuclear weapons to wipe Israel off the map.  We tried to get inside the head of Iranian leaders they say well this revolution of ours happened twenty seven years ago and to this day the US has never recognized us.  And look historically at countries that have pursued nuclear weapons.  Not been for offensive purposes.  Has been very much driven by senses of insecurity and defensive purposes.  I would just invoke the paradigm which many in the right in the US have invoked when it comes to Iran.  And that is one of two ticking clocks.  So there's the regime change clock and there's the nuclear clock.  And the idea is that you have to make the regime change clock in Tehran expire faster than the nuclear talk so when the day comes when Iran actually weaponizes, it will be under more friendly, democratic Iranian regime.  Now the fundamental contradiction of this policy is that when you try to expedite the regime change clock in Tehran you send the message to Iranian leaders that in fact the United States is after nuclear, is after regime change approach.  And therefore you need to pursue a nuclear deterrent. So we have to get these clocks worked up.  Is the option, is the goal to prevent Iran from going nuclear or is it to change the regime?  If we continue to try to do both, that's going to be Iran's greatest impetus for pursuing a nuclear weapon.\"]\n",
      "['Thank you.  Its a pleasure to be here tonight to tell you why we must tolerate a nuclear Iran.  Its time for the United States to rewrite the balance of power.  Iran has been using its nuclear program to bolster its legitimacy, domestically in Iran, regionally in the Middle East, and internationally, And this tactic is coming at the expense of American credibility and influence in these arenas.  So by engaging Iran over its nuclear program, Washington can take this tool of coercion out of Tehrans hands, and once again have a larger degree of influence as well as credibility within Iran, within the region of the Middle East, and internationally.  Let me tell you how Tehran is using its nuclear program to its advantage.  Let me start with the domestic. By engaging, the U.S. would prevent the Iranian regime from using the nuclear program as a pretext for regime preservation. Through its domestic policies, Tehran has advanced its power under the guise of this program.  The administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is tactically manipulating its nationalistic nuclear ambitions to foster support domestically.   Important though, is if you ask the average Iranian, what is nuclear energy, or what is uranium enrichment, they wouldnt be able to tell you.  This is what the government has homed in on.  Theyve been able to exploit the double standards that exist within the international community, vis--vis Irans nuclear program, compared to Indias, Pakistans, North Koreas, and even Israels.  This is what the government draws strength.  An edict was issued roughly six months ago through the National Security Council preventing negative media from being reported on nuclear issues domestically, and the government uses censorship of media to control popular access to any nuclear-related information, among other information as well. This way, the government has been successful in perpetuating nuclear nationalism, and controlling the effect of that nationalism.  For Iran, the nuclear issue is linked to the nations place in the modern world, national pride, and resistance against the West.  An effort to prevent Irans program from advancing is further associated to discrimination, and perpetuated by fears of sanctions and regime change.  More interestingly, as I observed this summer during my visit to Tehran, Ahmadinejad has more support throughout Tehran today and in other cities on foreign policy issues than he did last year after he was surprisingly elected. This is due to his confrontational approach, compared to the policy of dtente that was pursued under the Hatami administration.  You might ask why.  Thats because many Iranians feel quite happy and proud that he has taken on the nuclear portfolio and succeeded in garnering more concessions for Iran, compared to what was going on during the tenure of President Hatami.  So these confrontational tactics are also domestic tactics pursued by the government, acts of deflection to perpetuate a constant state of fear domestically, with regards to sanctions and even a military strike, and these tactics are designed to strengthen the hand of the regime and the unclear program.  This is why we should tolerate a nuclear Iran.  We should think about the Iranians at home that have to suffer under the regime.  The same time, the government is using the opportunity of the nuclear threat to launch a domestic crackdown on elites within the system.  Theyve closed down reformist newspapers.  Theyre purging universities of secular academics. Theyre detaining students.  Theyre purging bureaucrats from the system.  All in an effort to silence opposition, and all under the paradigm and all under the guise of the nuclear program. The regime is ever more united in the face of opposition.  Lets also consider a counter-factual.  If we do not tolerate Irans unclear program, we are playing into the hands of Ahmadinejad. He dreams of becoming a war president.  Why was he elected?  He was elected on an economic platform.  He was elected to be a populistic President.  But since hes been in power for the past year, he has yet to meet the demands of the people, and he has been pursuing foreign policy issues, not economic ones.  Any nuclear strike, military strike, or sanctions would give him just cause for continuing to neglect his electoral mandate. So let me offer you even one more final reason why we should tolerate a nuclear Iran on the domestic agenda.  The government is further playing to these domestic nationalistic sentiments of the Iranian street, and playing up against the Iranian street that has historically been very pro-American.  Theyre using their imagery of the war, and theyre using fear of sanctions and regime change to change the sentiment in Iran against the United States, and this is a huge loss for Washington.  Lets turn to the region. Ahmadinejad has also exploited the nuclear issue to no end.  This issue has gained a lot of support among the Arab and Muslim street.  Hes spoken of the double standards that exist among U.S. policies in the Middle East.  Hes taken on the plight of the Palestinians, challenging the order in the recent war this summer, and hes earned praise in capitols from Cairo to Jakarta. Theres also a credible', 'threat of proxy war.  Its a notable one, and the regime has cultivated relations with proxies to counterbalance the very large American presence in the region with two unfinished wars on Irans borders.  So Tehrans message is simpleits a regime not to be reckoned with [sic].  The U.S. is in a weakened position in Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and with this growing conflict within the religion of Islam.  Tehran is exploiting this to its advantage, drawing on the Arab street for support at the expense of the United States.  Internationally.  The regimes confrontational regional and domestic approach of the nuclear program has also divided and weakened the international community at Washingtons expense.  Unable to unite the international community and drive a consensus on sanctions, only weakens Washingtons position further.  Jacques Shirac recently defected, and China and Russia are unable to back Washington', 'on any sanctions in this nuclear jockeying thats going back and forth.  Lets compare Ahmadinejad.  Hes able to rally 118 NAM nations to support Irans ambitions, and the United States cant rally the P-5 and the Security Council?  Thats depressing. So, Ahmadinejad says he supports dialogue, lets take him up on this offer.  I leave you with this.  The U.S. is losing the Iranian street, its moving into dangerous territory in the Arab and Muslim world, and its losing support in the Security Council. Lets take the lever away from Tehran.  Lets not allow them to exploit their nuclear program at our expense anymore.  Thank you. [APPLAUSE]', 'Could I just add one more thing.  If we also think about bombing Iran, we also have to think about not just nuclear nationalism that persists within the country, but just inherent nationalism, the patriotism of Iranians that they feel for their country, Iranians who dont even love the regime but love Iran.  The same way that you might love the United States of America or wherever youre from.  These are the Iranians that will come out in defense of their country.  There are many Iranians I spoke with this summer, that said in the event of a military strike, they would come out in defense of their country and thats something that we should consider.  These are the people that fought an Iran-Iraq war, not for two years, not for four years, for eight long years. And that same way that you, your sons and your children would come out and defend the United States in the event of a military strike.', 'Oh, no, hes begging the U.S. to do it.  Hes not there just yet.  I think you misinterpreted.  Hes looking for the U.S. to bomb Iran so he can avoid the economic mandate, his populistic mandate of why he was elected.  He is not going to be able to fill the plates of 74 million Iranians.   And so foreign policy issues are a nice method of deflection for this president.  Bombing Iran would propel this radical president to a higher post.  The presidency of Iran is never, historically and constitutionally, a strong position, and were making him stronger every day by paying attention to him.  If we bomb the country, he will be propelled even more.  We will be radicalizing the country in his favor even more, and he will be neglecting his economic mandate, and the fastest way to get him out of power will be to force him to focus on the economic issues that he was elected into office on.', \"I appreciate Reuel's comments that the government of Iran is the vanguard of leading this one fourth of, and Patrick's, one fourth of the world into jihad.  But that's not the government that I'm aware of and that I have been studying.  Perhaps two different countries that we've been working on.  And my interviews that I recently conducted in Tehran, many people in the variety of camps of the regime, Ahmadinejad's ministry as well, told me repeatedly that it's the constant threat from abroad, regime change threats from the US administration that have been coming from the past four years.  Threats of sanctions, containment, isolation of this regime that are perpetuating these fears within the Iranian regime.  So consider that when thinking the Iranian mentality.  There are two ways of going forward.  We have the military option.  But we have an option that has never been actually pursued.  Twenty seven years of isolation, there's a wide gulf.  Why not actually try direct engagement with these crazy folks?  And let's see actually what they might do.  If we're actually dealing with them one on one bring them close.  Make your enemies our friends.  We can monitor their nuclear program and often times there's a lot of talk on the Iranian street that the hope of having America back in Iran will actually stimulate the Iranian people and recharge them and that might be the way to perhaps lead to a prosperous and maybe even hopeful Iran in the future.\"]\n",

      "[\"Well, I'm afraid I don't have anything good to say about any of the recent ones, but I do always tell people that Warren G. Harding gets a bad rap. [laughter] It's time America forgave him for teapot dome.\", 'The distinguished and charming Deborah Pearlstein.', 'Thank you.  The president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without Congressional authorization, or to put tonight\\'s debate resolution another way, the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.  You may have heard that second formulation before.  It\\'s how candidate Obama described the limits of presidential war powers when he was asked about it during campaign 2008.  And it came up a lot about three years later when President Obama unilaterally launched a seven-month bombing campaign against Libya.  Not only was there no actual or imminent threat to the nation in that case, but 10 days into the bombing, the president\\'s own secretary of defense went on Meet the Press and admitted that Libya wasn\\'t a vital interest to the United States. The president took us into our latest war in the Middle East, the ongoing conflict against ISIS, last August.  Here again there was no imminent threat.  \"We have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland,\" President Obama told the country in his nationally televised address, and yet he waited six months and over 2,000 airstrikes before he got around to sending a draft request for authorization to Congress, along with a cover note insisting that existing statutes provide me with all the authority I need to wage war anyway.  The central basis for that claim, as Professor Bobbitt notes, is the 2001 AUMF, the resolution that Congress passed three days after 9/11 empowering the president to take military action against \"those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11th attacks, or harbored those who did.\" Now, not exclusively, but principally, obviously, al-Qaeda and the Taliban.  And judging by what the people in Congress said about it at the time, the people who passed it certainly didn\\'t think they were committing the United States to open-ended, multi-generational war.  Now, nearly 14 years later, this war has gone on 10 years longer than World War II, four years longer than Vietnam, and counting.  Under the 9/11 AUMF President Obama has launched six times the number of drone strikes as President Bush against groups with evermore tenuous and remote connections to the language -- to the resolution\\'s language and original target.  Two years ago Obama officials told the Washington Post that they were increasingly concerned that the law is being stretched to its legal breaking point. That was before they\\'d stretched it still further.  President Obama now argues that the 9/11 AUMF allows him to go after -- go to war with groups like ISIS that have not just distanced themselves from al-Qaeda, but have been denounced and excommunicated by al-Qaeda.  It may even allow, and the theory -- the administration\\'s theory of the 2001 AUMF, it may even allow him to go after ISISs offshoots and sympathizers as so-called associated forces of a force that al-Qaeda refuses to associate with.  Earlier this month at a Senate hearing, President Obama\\'s new secretary of defense acknowledged that the resolution may be broad enough to allow the president to wage war in Nigeria against Boko Haram, which recently pledged allegiance to ISIS on Twitter. In fact, the administration\\'s interpretation of the 9/11 AUMF is so broad they can\\'t tell you how broad it is.  For one thing, who we\\'re at war with is classified.  In testimony last May, the Pentagon\\'s general counsel told the Senate that which groups the administration claims legal authority to target under the AUMF, well, that\\'s something that they\\'re \"just not prepared to discuss in an open session.\"  Meanwhile, Obama administration officials admit that there\\'s no end in sight to worldwide war making.  The war on terror will go on \"at least 10 to 20 years more,\" which means, I suppose, that in 2032, when we\\'re all filled with excitement about the impending presidential contest between Chelsea Clinton and George P. Bush -- [laughter] -- we can rest assured that the winner will get to use the September 2001 AUMF as the basis for his or her presidential kill list.  This is not how constitutional democracies are supposed to make the most important decision that any society can make.  President Obama has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without congressional authorization, but it\\'s worse than that.  The arguments he\\'s advanced will make it even easier for future presidents to do the same.  I urge you to vote, \"Yes,\" on the motion.  Thank you. [applause]', \"Yeah, the notion that all they did was change their name is not right, as Deborah's pointed out. I'd also say that, as she pointed out, the ISIS strategy is to focus on the near enemy.  Al-Qaeda's strategy is to focus on the far enemy.  The fact that ISIS has local apocalyptic and monstrous goals may explain -- and the fact that they're locally focused probably helps explain why evey major figure in the national security establishment, from the chairman of the joint chiefs to two heads of the National Counterterrorism Center, has said that there is no evidence that ISIS has plans or major capability to attack the homeland.\", 'Well, as Deborah said, the bulk of the war powers are with Congress.  The declare war clause, which Madison identified as the part of the Constitution, where the most wisdom was to be found, is an independent check on -- or it was intended to be an independent check on presidential ability to initiate war.  All the -- you know, most of the framers who spoke about this power, James Wilson, the architect of the presidency, said, \"This system will not hurry us into war.  It is calculated to guard against it.\" And he identified the declare war clause as the clause he was talking about.  George Washington wasn\\'t sure he had the power to launch offensive operations against Indians without an authorization from Congress.  So this was an important check.  Moreover, where does the president get the power?  The president doesn\\'t get the power from the commander in chief clause, and Alexander Hamilton said that was -- that meant nothing more than that he was the first general and admiral of the United States, and generals and admirals don\\'t get to decide whether and with whom we go to war.', \"You don't need the magic words, you didn't -- it was recognized from the first generation that you did not need formal authorization.  You need some kind of substantive authorization that perhaps is renewed more than once a generation.\", \"You've mentioned that clause several times, and the actual history of that --\", \"-- no, the actual history of that clause was the Bush administration's original draft of the AUMF gave the president the power to deter and -- an independent power to deter and preempt all future acts of terrorism against the United States. That was so horrifying to a Congress, even in the aftershock of 9/11, that they changed that language to dis-link [spelled phonetically] that as an independent power.\", 'He has the power to go after persons or organizations linked to 9/11 for the purpose of --', \"Well, they're shooting at each other.\", 'I think the president has residual powers under Article II to deal with -- you know, Deborah mentioned the phrase, \"Repelling sudden attacks,\" which comes up at the Constitutional Convention.  And I think you can be flexible with that.  I don\\'t think you have to be wedded to an 18th century understanding, or one that doesn\\'t comport with modern warfare.  But you do have to -- for the president to legitimately use this reserved Article II power, it has to actually be a threat to the country.  And it --', '-- [unintelligible] --', 'Not in the remotest sense.', 'Well, you just said --', \"-- Professor Amar was doing a lot better than Secretary of Defense Gates in that he was able to make that argument with a straight face. [laughter] When Gates, once in Congress and once on 60 Minutes, tried to sell the idea that launching thousands of Tomahawk missiles at another sovereign country wasn't war, he had to smirk. That was the line he was given to sell and he did not sell it.\", 'Yeah.', \"Well, you know, it's hard to discern, but a quarter of his mouth turned up.\", \"Well, the administration has changed its own criteria for what it includes in associated forces, a term that doesn't appear anywhere in the AUMF.  It used to require co-belligerency with al- Qaeda.  ISIS is not a cobelligerent with al-Qaeda.  It's an organization that is not only in competition with al-Qaeda, but at times actively fighting al-Qaeda affiliates.  So, you know, I think at some point you have to read that organization out of the definition.  And they were concerned about the legal basis for this and how open-ended it was two years before they shifted to expand their own definition to allow ISIS in.  Before the --\", '-- yes --', \"-- the Obama administration attorneys were -- there was a -- you know, from what you -- from what you can tell from public accounts of it, a pretty fiery debate over whether they had the authority, even before ISIS came on the scene, to stretch the law as far as they'd already stretched it.\", \"There's a long history of Congress's feeling compelled to continue wars and to provide funding for wars that the president has launched.  In Libya, as I recall, there was no specific -- separate appropriation for the Libyan conflict.  It came out of the Overseas Contingency Fund.  And what's more, the House actually voted down authorization.  At some point, when you say the president can go and wage war wherever he wants and if Congress funds it, that's fine, you've sort of turned the Constitution on its head.  You've put all the checks that are supposed to stand in the way of unilateral action, and then Congress -- and then the president's action stands unless -- as you know, in the Vietnam War, there's an actual effort to defund it.  I think that puts -- that makes things exactly backwards.\", 'Actually, this debate is about whether the president has exceeded his constitutional authority by waging war without Congressional authorization.', \"I didn't say that.\", \"Professor Bobbitt, you have a pretty broad view of what appropriations authorize.  If I -- looking at the Foreign Policy article that you -- that is on the Intelligence Squared website, I believe you said in 2013 that the very fact that Congress funded bunker busters meant that they couldn't be surprised if the president decided to launch them against Syria.  Isn't that a pretty broad view of -- it's sort of if I lease my -- if I give my employee a company car I should not be able to complain if he takes it on a joyride.\", 'If he uses it to invade another country?', 'Thank you.  To agree with our opponents on tonight\\'s motion you\\'d have to accept some pretty extraordinary propositions.  You\\'d have to believe that the president has not just the power to repel sudden attacks, but the right to launch them.  You\\'d have to accept the proposition that three days after September 11, Congress delegated its war powers to the president in near perpetuity, one Congress, one vote, one time; and that that war can be conducted for decades to come on a need-to-know basis with minimal public debate.  You\\'d have to swallow the notion that seven months of regime change bombing in Libya isn\\'t war for constitutional purposes.  It isn\\'t even hostilities under the war powers resolution, so long as -- and this is the actual argument they\\'ve made, the administration that is -- it\\'s not hostility so long as the country we\\'re bombing can\\'t easily hit us back. That last one has what I think are pretty staggering implications in an age of remote controlled warfare.  It\\'s also, I have to say, a somewhat grotesque doctrine for a humane, internationalist president to advance.  Put starkly, it says, \"Killing a bunch of foreigners isn\\'t war; war is what happens when actual Americans might get hurt.  Then it\\'s serious.  You might even need congressional authorization, unless, of course, our president thinks there\\'s an emergency threat to our humanitarian values, as in Libya.  Well, our constitutional values demand debate and authorization before the resort to deadly force.  They demand a vote.  Tonight, please vote, \"Yes,\" on the motion, \"The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.\"  Thank you.']\n",
      "[\"If I had to sum it up, I'd say they expected that the legislature would actually want to legislate. [laughter]\", 'Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, it\\'s a pleasure to be here, and thank you for the opportunity.  The president has certainly exceeded his constitutional power by waging war without Congressional authorization for the following reasons. First, as Nick Rosenkranz mentioned at the top, the text of the Constitution, the history, are actually quite clear on the idea that power over armed forces, power to commit those troops, to make war wherever they do it, is shared between the executive and the Congress.  The executive would have the power as commander in chief to superintend the armed forces.  He would also have the power to repel sudden attacks in the event our nation came under attack, but the vast majority of the power over the armed forces, and over war making in the United States, if you look in the Constitution, it\\'s there under Article I Section 8.  It\\'s given to Congress. They have the power to raise and support an army, to provide and maintain a navy, to issue letters of mark and reprisal, an old fashioned way of saying to appoint agents or to hire agents of the U.S. government, who would carry out lesser military actions against our enemies. And of course, Congress also has the power to declare war.  The reason this matters, the text matters, is because the purpose of the framers was also clear.  The president would have the power to act in our national defense if it was necessary, but actually commencing war, risking huge sums in national blood and treasure, that no one man should have the power to do. Madison said, \"In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive.  The trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man.\"  Now, my opponents will tell you that it\\'s not so much what the text of the Constitution says, or even why the Constitution said it that way, but what matters is what we\\'ve actually done, and in particular, what presidents have actually done in the past, say, 50 or 60 years of the nation\\'s history, because before that they almost always went to Congress to at least get an authorization for the use of force. So, let\\'s set aside for the moment the notion that it\\'s a little bit of a weird way to interpret the Constitution by saying, well, it means whatever the president has been doing, and thinks he can get away with, in every -- any given administration.  Let\\'s set that aside for a minute.  Let\\'s also set aside the problem of that methodology, which is how do we decide we agree on what particular presidents did, and more importantly, why they were doing it.  Were they acting in national defense or did they have a clear sense even in their own minds of what the purpose was for deploying force in a given case?  Let\\'s set both of those aside for now and make it clear that no president in the United States has declared or asserted an unlimited power to make war without congressional authorization.  The Office of Legal Counsel -- right, this is the office in the Department of Justice that counsels the president on how much power he has to use force abroad -- recognizes in its memoranda limits that the president has to follow when he uses force without congressional authorization. And even this president, his OLC said \"Look, you can only do this without Congress if it\\'s in the national interest, and if the force that you\\'re using is less than war.\"  Why does it matter?  Well, of course, because the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war.  So if what you\\'re doing is actual war, then you actually have to go to Congress.  How do you tell the difference between what\\'s war and what\\'s not war by this president\\'s own metric?  Well, in Libya, the last time he used force without congressional authorization, he said it was because, this is a short term commitment, right?  We\\'re not going to be there very long.  We\\'re going to get in.  We\\'re going to get out.  We\\'re going to have a very limited mission, right?  Just protecting civilians pursuant to a U.N. Security Council Resolution, and there will be minimal risk to Americans in any event, right?  The problem today is that the conflict against ISIL in Iraq and Syria is, even by the president\\'s own metric, war, in a constitutional sense. The president said when he committed troops, when he expanded our operations in Iraq and Syria, that this is going to take some time.  He announced a broad mission.  Our mission is not to protect particular individuals or even keep the peace.  Our mission is broadly to destroy and degrade another organization, ISIL, the \"Islamic State\" as it calls itself.  By January of this year, the United States had carried out close to 10,000 airstrikes in the region; we have 7,000 contractors in our employee -- in our employ on the ground; and 4,500 military personnel already serving in the theater.  \"Okay,\" my opponents will say, \"but that\\'s fine.\"  So what matters is not even so much what the president has done in the past.  What matters is what works.  We need the flexibility.  The president needs the ability to respond to new threats, to new dangers.  And that does matter.  But in this case, that\\'s not what\\'s going on. There has been more than enough time, there remains enough time for Congress to authorize the use of force.  Indeed, the president has gone to Congress and asked it to authorize the use of force in the case of ISIL.  There is plenty, further, of strategic cause for Congress to authorize force.  Congressional authorization is an incredibly important signal.  It signals our allies that we\\'re serious about the fight.  It signals our enemies that we\\'re serious about the fight.  And it signals, particularly in a conflict like this, to what our security friends call, \"Wavering neutrals in the region,\" right?  Those folks who looked at what we did in the past conflicts, they looked at Abu Ghraib, they looked at Guantanamo, they said, \"I don\\'t buy the United States,\" and it shows them we\\'re as good as our word.  For all of these reasons, the framers thought so; it remains a good idea.  You need to vote for the resolution.  Congress needs to authorize the use of force.  Thank you.', \"Sure.  So I find the notion, to use the word, absurd.  The text of the authorization for the use of force doesn't name them.  Congress never conceived that ISIL was the group that they meant to be authorizing force -- again, in part, because ISIL and even Al-Qaeda in Iraq -- as it used to be called by the United States -- didn't exist in 2001.  And this group, just because it once had some association with Al-Qaeda that did exist in 2001, isn't it.  You know, the United States is an offshoot of Great Britain in some fundamental way, but I'd like to think, after a certain time and a certain set of disagreements, you can tell the difference --\", '-- between one and another.', \"I don't.  In fact, it's not just a name.  It's a fundamental mission.  So, when Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and before, Osama Bin Laden named the United States its primary enemy.  He declared war against the United States.  He attacked the United States repeatedly.  He viewed the United States and its political operations and factions in the Middle East as the source of the problem. ISIL is in essence an apocalyptic cult.  They fight the United States today for the same reason that they fight al-Qaeda today, because they believe that they are not true believers of Islamism in the way they believe it should be practiced, and they do not take the United States as its enemy per se any more than they take anyone else.  In other words, its not just the name thats different, the mission of the group --\", 'There might be some limits to that proposition, right?  The president determines, he alone.  So if the president determines alone in a fit of pique that China is in fact now al-Qaeda, right, does the authorization for the use of military force to authorize the president to go after those who attacked us on 9/11 authorize the president to use force against anyone?', \"We detained people in Guantanamo who were from China.  We let them go actually not all that long ago, right?  So the notion that there are some of the same people in some of these same places I think is insufficient to establish what the administration says, which is not that ISIL is an associated group of al-Qaeda or an off-shoot, but that ISIL is al-Qaeda, right?  The administration can't say they're an associated force.  ISIL and al-Qaeda are shooting at each other.\", 'Which court has held that --', \"If I took everything that Congress does as proof of its constitutionality, I would have to challenge, right, Marbury versus Madison.  Just because Congress has passed a law doesn't mean the law Congress has passed is constitutional.\", 'I think --', \"-- I don't think -- Congress's authorization -- Male Speaker: Does it violate the text -- Deborah Pearlstein: -- for the use of funds is constitutional, but I don't think we can take their authorization for the use of funds as a commentary on whether or not they think the president has the power to wage war without congressional authorization.\", 'The language isn\\'t linked.  The language is responsible for the attacks of 9/11. And I want to come back to the question that was posed here a minute ago, which is \"Why is it that we should have -- and we all agree, right, some congressional authorization is required -- the notion is, \"Well, you don\\'t have to say specifically who the enemy is, right?  The enemy can be al-Qaeda, the Taliban, associated forces, people responsible for the attacks of 9/11, or whoever, right?  The reason why you need Congressional authorization and the reason why you have to name who the enemy is, is the same.  It is in order for Congress to have a meaningful check in a democracy.  You can\\'t lead a people into war without telling them who they\\'re going to war against and why.  So --', \"-- that's why naming the enemy is as important --\", '-- as the authorization in the first place.', \"I don't think I was suggesting Congress passed a --\", \"I'm saying the statute is entirely constitutional.  And all three branches of government have concluded that the statute authorized the use of force against three groups -- al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces.  ISIL is not the Taliban.  The administration says they're not associated forces, because after all, they're fighting with each other.  The administration says they're Al-Qaeda, and I'm telling you, there's no sense in which they're Al-Qaeda.  And I'm not the only one who says that, because I'm after all, not that persuasive, right?  You've got to read the West Point Counterterrorism Center report.  You've got to read, actually, a wonderful piece in the Atlantic about who ISIL is.  And no matter what the president says, at some level, there's got to be a recognition of who we're talking about.  And this isn't it.\", \"I haven't --\", '-- [unintelligible] that it -- [unintelligible] --', '-- what federal court is it that has --', '-- opined on ISIS?', \"They didn't talk about ISIL at all. It didn't exist then.\", \"I think maybe we might agree.  I think for present purposes especially there's no constitutional difference between declaring war against ISIL and authorizing the use of force against ISIL. In either event, depending on the terms of the authorization for the use of force, Congress could of course impose a limitation, right?  The president can't use ground troops, for example, but assuming the authorization for the use of force in the statute didn't authorize anything different, I think they have the same effect in this case.\", \"Actually -- right, so I don't quite agree with that.  Right, so and let's take practice and current authorization of which Professor Amar is so fond, right, to invade Afghanistan and to detain an intern over the course of that war, and indeed the broader war with al-Qaeda, tens of thousands of prisoners.  And we repeatedly -- and Congress embraced this, the president embraced this, the courts have embraced it -- repeatedly invoked the international law of war, international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, exactly those laws.  So if we thought it required a declaration of war as such to do that, everything we've done more or less [unintelligible].\", 'To --', 'So, the United States has an obligation under its treaty commitments, which after the supreme law of the land, and to observe that law of war in any armed conflict, and it would say it applied here.', 'No.', 'Indeed. It would render --', \"-- the declare war clause and the associated clauses there, effectively moot.  If all Congress had to do to authorize war was appropriate funds, then why include a declare war power at all? What would the point of that ever be?  And we just talked about how perfecting it, in the sense of international law, can't be it.  In fact, the administration itself doesn't make the argument that the funds Congress has appropriated for military action, part of which -- a large part of which at the beginning was in defense of our own assets in the region, to the extent that they were being attacked.  The president himself says the conflict has gone much beyond that now. But the president himself doesn't rest on that.  He says he rests on his Article II Authority and then he asks Congress for additional authorization, which is why the House and Senate are debating the need for a new authorization now.\", \"Well, is he right about, it'll depend what the new authorization says?  It'll certainly depend what the new authorization says, right, but part of the necessity for a new authorization, and indeed I think part of the reason, and I know we're not debating the administration, but the fact is even the president, if we are deferring to his judgment, thinks we should have a new authorization. Part of the purpose for that is to clarify exactly what we're doing and against whom we're doing it.  And I think the sort of notion that the 2001 AUMF was sufficient to get us through pretty much anyone in that messy Middle East because they're close enough is not only a legal error, it's a strategic error of the most profound sense. We don't want to lump them together.  They're different groups, and if we do that we only strengthen both of them.  I think it's that strategic error that the president is most worried about.\", 'Thank you.  So I would like to know the names of the members of ISIL that were part of al- Qaeda when it attacked us at 9/11.  The leader of ISIL, al-Baghdadi, right, was radicalized when the United States invaded Iraq after 9/11, another nation that was not responsible for the attacks of 9/11.  I think the fundamental point as this, right?  There is a difference between al- Qaeda and ISIL, enough of a difference that there needs to be new authorization, and the president himself, the expert that Professor Bobbitt suggests we look to first, agrees with that, which is why he has gone to Congress. More broadly, the framers of the Constitution wanted it to be hard to go to war.  They imposed a series of checks in order to make it hard.  We were going to have appropriations for military funding in the full view of God and everyone every two years.  The Constitution requires it. Now we fund military operations substantially through funding contractors; through different departments, the funding is hidden.  They wanted citizens to be -- to serve in the military. These days about .5 percent of Americans serve in the military.  80 percent of us support the troops, 90 percent of us can\\'t find Afghanistan on a map.  Congress and Congress\\'s ability to say, \"This is the war we want to fight, these are the reasons, these are the people\" -- Congress is one of the last and most significant checks we have of limiting, constraining, in any way slowing the march to war that we might otherwise be inclined to take. The president has asked Congress to help us define what that war is.  We should keep this one last check.  You know, I was briefing some young Congressional staffers last week on what this would mean if they passed a new authorization.  And they despaired of Congress taking any action.  You can tell them, \"It\\'s not despairing.  We think you should take action.\"  Vote for the resolution in this debate.']\n",
